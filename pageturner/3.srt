79
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,960

80
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't lift them.</font>

81

<font color="yellow">Don't lie.</font>

82
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,720

<font color="yellow">How did you know that? Are you sure you're blind?</font>

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,160
<font color="yellow">If I couldn't do it, she would yell and pinch me.</font>

85
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,200
<font color="yellow">She told me she wouldn't...</font>

86
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,160
<font color="yellow">put in much effort since we wouldn't make it anyway.</font>

87
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,320
<font color="yellow">But she was still so scary.</font>

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,760
<font color="yellow">How is it? Don't you think I'm getting there?</font>

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,990
<font color="yellow">As much as a drop in the bucket.</font>

90

<font color="yellow">Really? How big is the bucket?</font>

91
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,320
<font color="yellow">I'm saying, you didn't get much better!</font>

92
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,490
<font color="yellow">She gets upset and screams.</font>

93
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,140
<font color="yellow">Are you straining your wrists?</font>

94
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,210
<font color="yellow">I'm so amazed by you.</font>

95
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,140
<font color="yellow">How can you only get worse? What's your secret?</font>

96
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,810
<font color="yellow">You have the most useless hands I've ever known!</font>

97
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,440
<font color="yellow">Relax the wrists for trills.</font>

98
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,340
<font color="yellow">You have to play with your fingers. Do I have to tell you again?</font>

99
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,420
<font color="yellow">Your index finger is too weak.</font>

100
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,900
<font color="yellow">Can't you do this? Why can't you?</font>

101
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,940
<font color="yellow">This is so easy, but why can't you do it?</font>

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,190
<font color="yellow">And Yoo Seul gradually became a monster.</font>

103
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,810
<font color="yellow">And in the end...</font>

104
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,920
<font color="yellow">Hey! If I could do it, why would I learn it from you?</font>

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,560
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Forget it!</font>

106
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,620
<font color="yellow">I blew up.</font>

107
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,970

108
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,460
<font color="yellow">Why won't you listen to me? You useless thing!</font>

109
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,120
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

110
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,700

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,730

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,550
<font color="yellow">They say one shouldn't go back on their words.</font>

125
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I keep changing my mind...</font>

126
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,790

128
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,990

129
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,690
<font color="yellow">will make me forgive you?</font>

130
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,070
<font color="yellow">- Are you smiling?
-  No.</font>

131
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,800
<font color="yellow">- No, you did.
-  No, I didn't.</font>

132
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,090

133
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,210
<font color="yellow">Do something about that voice!</font>

134
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,800
<font color="yellow">Hey. This is funny, right?</font>

135
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,760
<font color="yellow">I can even sing a song for you.</font>

136
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,350
<font color="yellow">The sky is pouring out light</font>

137
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,990
<font color="yellow">Stop it, stop it. It's not funny at all.</font>

138
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,290
<font color="yellow">And there's a kid standing underneath it</font>

139
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
<font color="yellow">Up, down, up, up, down</font>

140
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,690
<font color="yellow">Seeing Yoo Seul laugh...</font>

141
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,660
<font color="yellow">was prettier than I had imagined.</font>

142
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,190
<font color="yellow">Her smile is so beautiful.</font>

143
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,620
<font color="yellow">But why did she always keep that stern face of hers?</font>

144
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,970
<font color="yellow">I can't wait to play with Yoo Seul...</font>

145
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,990
<font color="yellow">at the competition on stage.</font>

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,590
<font color="yellow">I'm curious to find out...</font>

147
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
<font color="yellow">what her face would say after we finish performing.</font>

148
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,460
<font color="yellow">I think "Two Piano Competition" is supposed to be in February.</font>

149
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,590
<font color="yellow">(Do I have any schedules in February?)</font>

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,160
<font color="yellow">(No. Are you thinking of going to Korea?)</font>

151
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,860
<font color="yellow">(I'm getting more curious...)</font>

152
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,760
<font color="yellow">(about my son.)</font>

153
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,540
<font color="yellow">You know that registration deadline for the competition is today, right?</font>

154
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,890
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Yes.</font>

155
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,630
<font color="yellow">Seo Jin Mok.</font>

156
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,470
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you applied yet?</font>

157
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,400
<font color="yellow">You used to always be the first in line to register.</font>

158
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,120
<font color="yellow">I'm not participating this time.</font>

159
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,140
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

160
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,970
<font color="yellow">You should try and participate in all the competitions...</font>

161
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,490
<font color="yellow">to build experience before your senior year.</font>

162
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,920
<font color="yellow">I want to build other experiences, too.</font>

163
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,860
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

164
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,460
<font color="yellow">It's snowing.</font>

165
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,790
<font color="yellow">The snow is acidic these days. I don't want to go bald.</font>

166
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,470
<font color="yellow">Hey, you look really funny right now.</font>

167
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,990
<font color="yellow">Everyone is staring at you.</font>

168
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,820
<font color="yellow">That's fine.</font>

169
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,760
<font color="yellow">Since I can't see anything, it doesn't embarrass me.</font>

170
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,090
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for Larva?</font>

171
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,560
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

172
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,420
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's going to be fine joining the competition with him?</font>

173
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,820
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

174
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,460
<font color="yellow">I just hope you're not being forced to go because of him.</font>

175
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,370
<font color="yellow">It'll be embarrassing if you make a fool of yourself.</font>

176
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,490
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

177
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,920
<font color="yellow">Since I can't see anything, nothing embarrasses me.</font>

178
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,990
<font color="yellow">And on top of that, I won't be making a fool of myself.</font>

179
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,090
<font color="yellow">Cha Sik is improving by the minute.</font>

180
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,300
<font color="yellow">I began to believe that he may really be Hyun Myung Sae's son.</font>

181
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,200
<font color="yellow">He's improving so fast.</font>

182
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,900
<font color="yellow">Am I? Really?</font>

183
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,790
<font color="yellow">I heard you and Cha Sik made a bet.</font>

184
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,860
<font color="yellow">It's too bad. I think you'll lose.</font>

185
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,560
<font color="yellow">You are the one...</font>

186
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,290
<font color="yellow">who should be scared of getting humiliated.</font>

187
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,420
<font color="yellow">Yoo Seul!</font>

188
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,990
<font color="yellow">Then, bye.</font>

189
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,070
<font color="yellow">Let's go. We have to practise.</font>

190
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,090
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

191
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,700
<font color="yellow">So it wasn't just me.</font>

192
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,590
<font color="yellow">I thought that my improvement was like a miracle.</font>

193
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,090
<font color="yellow">I wonder if this is why people call me a genius.</font>

194
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,720
<font color="yellow">Is there anyone around?</font>

195
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,690
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

196
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,920
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

197
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,320
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

198
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,590
<font color="yellow">You're far from it.</font>

199
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,790
<font color="yellow">You have a long way to go!</font>

200
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,730
<font color="yellow">At this rate,</font>

201
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sure both of us will be made fools on stage.</font>

202
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,040
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be humiliated.</font>

203
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,240
<font color="yellow">Especially in front of Jin Mok.</font>

204
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,690
<font color="yellow">I dread it.</font>

205
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,190
<font color="yellow">Are... Are you threatening me?</font>

206
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,060
<font color="yellow">I'm pleading you.</font>

207
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,320
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you...</font>

208
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,860
<font color="yellow">to please make it work.</font>

209
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,660
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

210
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,560
<font color="yellow">I won't humiliate you.</font>

211
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,800
<font color="yellow">I hate it as much as you do.</font>

212
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,520
<font color="yellow">I don't want Dumber to look down on me.</font>

213
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,970
<font color="yellow">- All right.
-  Okay.</font>

214
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,740
<font color="yellow">How about we put it up a notch?</font>

215
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,340
<font color="yellow">What do you think about practising until late at night?</font>

216
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,640
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

217
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,340
<font color="yellow">Since the school practice rooms will be empty at night,</font>

218
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,240
<font color="yellow">- we can practise there.
-  Great!</font>

219
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,740
<font color="yellow">I'll pick you up at 10pm!</font>

220
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,760
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

221
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,260
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Okay.</font>

222
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,530
<font color="yellow">Hello, it's Jeong Cha Sik.</font>

223
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,920
<font color="yellow">Did you come to pick up Yoo Seul at this hour?</font>

224
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

225
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,900
<font color="yellow">But please don't misunderstand.</font>

226
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,270
<font color="yellow">We're meeting this late only in order to do something healthy.</font>

227
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,620
<font color="yellow">I never asked.</font>

228
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,490
<font color="yellow">You didn't?</font>

229
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,160
<font color="yellow">How do I look today?</font>

230
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,790
<font color="yellow">Do I still look like a gangster doing rounds?</font>

231
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,220
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

232
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,930
<font color="yellow">You look like a burglar who's about to jump a fence.</font>

233
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,090
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

234
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,770
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

235
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,720
<font color="yellow">You look cheap and indecent.</font>

236
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,170
<font color="yellow">What's your secret?</font>

237
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,660
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean?</font>

238
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,820
<font color="yellow">Yoo Seul never played the piano while smiling.</font>

239
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,660
<font color="yellow">But when she's playing with you, I saw her smiling.</font>

240
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,600
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

241
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,100
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

242
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,120
<font color="yellow">Why did you think that I wouldn't know?</font>

243
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,820
<font color="yellow">I'm her mother.</font>

244
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,620
<font color="yellow">Cha Sik.</font>

245
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,520
<font color="yellow">Jeong Cha Sik. Are you here?</font>

246
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,060
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

247
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,180
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

248
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,860
<font color="yellow">Hey, be quiet. You might wake up my mum.</font>

249
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,460
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

250
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,290
<font color="yellow">Hey, well...</font>

251
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,620
<font color="yellow">How about we tell her about your playing piano again?</font>

252
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,490
<font color="yellow">I think she'll be happy.</font>

253
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,990
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

254
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,090
<font color="yellow">She'll have expectations if I tell her.</font>

255
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,490
<font color="yellow">And I'll be too pressured and mess up.</font>

256
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,620
<font color="yellow">But still...</font>

257
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,320
<font color="yellow">Did you bring your bike?</font>

258
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,660
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

259
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,560
<font color="yellow">I thought it would be dangerous at night, so I didn't.</font>

260
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,120
<font color="yellow">It would be bad if you got into an accident and hurt your hands.</font>

261
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,490
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

262
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,960
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

263
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,990
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

264
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,320
<font color="yellow">(Used upright piano for sale)</font>

265
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,720
<font color="yellow">It sounds boring to me, too.</font>

266
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,690
<font color="yellow">I think this part is the highlight, too.</font>

267
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,540
<font color="yellow">I like this part the best,</font>

268
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,120
<font color="yellow">but it's the hardest to play. The feeling's like...</font>

269
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,290
<font color="yellow">I didn't get the right feelings for it yet.</font>

270
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,520
<font color="yellow">But you have to feel it to play it.</font>

271
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,910
<font color="yellow">If you mess up here, you'd be messing up the whole song.</font>

272
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,260
<font color="yellow">That's how important it is.</font>

273
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,690
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

274
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,540
<font color="yellow">It's the most dramatic part.</font>

275
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,960
<font color="yellow">How should I explain the feeling?</font>

276
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,140
<font color="yellow">Okay, Cha Sik.</font>

277
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,860
<font color="yellow">We're at the tracks.</font>

278
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,460
<font color="yellow">- We're in the practice room.
-  I mean, imagine it!</font>

279
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

280
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,100
<font color="yellow">There is a really high crossbar in front of you.</font>

281
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,190
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

282
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,860
<font color="yellow">You're nervous.</font>

283
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,860
<font color="yellow">And you're not sure if you can go over it.</font>

284
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,790
<font color="yellow">But everything becomes calm all of a sudden.</font>

285
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,390
<font color="yellow">You have a good feeling about it.</font>

286
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,760
<font color="yellow">You think you might make it.</font>

287
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,990
<font color="yellow">Your heart beats faster.</font>

288
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,260
<font color="yellow">In pianissimo...</font>

289
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,430
<font color="yellow">And then,</font>

290
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,070
<font color="yellow">you take everything in you to pull it to a crescendo.</font>

291
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,670
<font color="yellow">Then you jump in a fortissimo.</font>

292
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,990
<font color="yellow">And you jump over it.</font>

293
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,560
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Do you think you can do it?</font>

294
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,790
<font color="yellow">You and I have to split this up and play it.</font>

295
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,660
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

296
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,640
<font color="yellow">But it might be hard for me to play right away.</font>

297
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,910
<font color="yellow">Give me some time.</font>

298
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,260
<font color="yellow">How fast do I have to play it?</font>

299
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,860
<font color="yellow">It's about 135 BPM on a metronome.</font>

300
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,990
<font color="yellow">135...</font>

301
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,490
<font color="yellow">My heart is beating.</font>

302
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,690
<font color="yellow">And as I start to run...</font>

303
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,490
<font color="yellow">It's slow. I'm too slow.</font>

304
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,990
<font color="yellow">How can I bring it up to 135 BPM?</font>

305
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,060
<font color="yellow">Give it up. You'll never make it.</font>

306
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,970
<font color="yellow">Hey, can you stop popping up randomly?</font>

307
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,440
<font color="yellow">I thought you had something going on with that big mouth,</font>

308
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,620
<font color="yellow">but you've got nothing.</font>

309
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,830
<font color="yellow">It's so bad, you won't make it even if it kills you.</font>

310
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,960
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

311
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,200
<font color="yellow">- Keep going.
-  What?</font>

312
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,070
<font color="yellow">I said, I agree with you, Dumber.</font>

313
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,470
<font color="yellow">- So keep on talking bad about me.
-  Larva...</font>

314
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,640
<font color="yellow">I'm not Larva, they call me Raging Bull.</font>

315
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,670
<font color="yellow">Because I go insane when people talk low of me.</font>

316
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,170
<font color="yellow">If I see people looking down on me, my blood starts to boil,</font>

317
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,560
<font color="yellow">and I get so energised from the anger.</font>

318
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,670
<font color="yellow">That's how I made the national record.</font>

319
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,300
<font color="yellow">So did you get angry by what I said?</font>

320
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,270
<font color="yellow">No. Not yet.</font>

321
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,040
<font color="yellow">So keep on making me mad.</font>

322
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,120
<font color="yellow">Just stomp on me, will you?</font>

323
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,470
<font color="yellow">I think if you can make me mad, I could bring it up to 135 BPM.</font>

324
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,400
<font color="yellow">Do you really think you have talent?</font>

325
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,620
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

326
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,320
<font color="yellow">That's how everyone starts.</font>

327
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,140
<font color="yellow">Then they realise how mediocre their talents are,</font>

328
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,520
<font color="yellow">and they start to wonder if they should continue.</font>

329
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,390
<font color="yellow">Then they get nervous about becoming a nobody.</font>

330
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,990
<font color="yellow">That's too weak.</font>

331
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,400
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Can't you try harder?</font>

332
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,800
<font color="yellow">That won't make my blood boil.</font>

333
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,270
<font color="yellow">- You're an idiot.
-  Try me, stomp on me harder.</font>

334
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,800
<font color="yellow">Make me as mad as a bonnet.</font>

335
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,770
<font color="yellow">It's supposed to be a hornet, not a bonnet!</font>

336
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,240
<font color="yellow">A bonnet is on a car,</font>

337
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,700
<font color="yellow">and a hornet is the insect.</font>

338
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,200
<font color="yellow">Don't you know the difference?</font>

339
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,270
<font color="yellow">"Bonnet" or "Hornet", it's all the same.</font>

340
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you so picky?</font>

341
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,440
<font color="yellow">You're not an entomologist like Pastre.</font>

342
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,570
<font color="yellow">It's not Pastre, it's Fabre.</font>

343
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,040
<font color="yellow">It's all the same.</font>

344
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,460
<font color="yellow">And I'm not stupid.</font>

345
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:11,920
<font color="yellow">(Yoo Seul Piano School)</font>

346
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,620
<font color="yellow">"Yoo Seul Piano School"?</font>

347
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,460
<font color="yellow">This Yoo Seul must be that Yoo Seul.</font>

348
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,790
<font color="yellow">That must be the woman who likes to criticise.</font>

349
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,790
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

350
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,420
<font color="yellow">I saw the poster outside about the used piano.</font>

351
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh, were you drinking?</font>

352
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,060
<font color="yellow">Don't bother getting up. I'll just take a look.</font>

353
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,990
<font color="yellow">After you look around,</font>

354
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,460
<font color="yellow">let me know if you like anything.</font>

355
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,140
<font color="yellow">My son just started playing the piano.</font>

356
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,790
<font color="yellow">I wonder which one would be good.</font>

357
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,040
<font color="yellow">He's improving so fast.</font>

358
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,420
<font color="yellow">I'm hoping to get something that's not just for beginners.</font>

359
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,120
<font color="yellow">That might be good for him...</font>

360
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,190
<font color="yellow">although it's a little expensive.</font>

361
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,770
<font color="yellow">That's okay. I can just withdraw from my funds.</font>

362
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,200
<font color="yellow">Rather than investing in something I don't know,</font>

363
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,370
<font color="yellow">it would be better to invest in my son.</font>

364
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,620
<font color="yellow">He wants to buy me a building and is working really hard.</font>

365
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,860
<font color="yellow">Your son is really sweet.</font>

366
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

367
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,990
<font color="yellow">So I plan on putting my everything on him.</font>

368
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,520
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

369
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,220
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

370
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,290
<font color="yellow">Don't put your life...</font>

371
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,990
<font color="yellow">on such a good son.</font>

372
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,700
<font color="yellow">I've already done it.</font>

373
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,790
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

374
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,420
<font color="yellow">it's like spraying water...</font>

375
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,120
<font color="yellow">on a kid dragging a cotton blanket.</font>

376
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,660
<font color="yellow">I was worried that my kid might be having a hard time,</font>

377
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,990
<font color="yellow">so I saved up the water I'd drink and sprayed it on her.</font>

378
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,060
<font color="yellow">But when the cotton blanket drank up the water,</font>

379
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,320
<font color="yellow">it must have been really heavy.</font>

380
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,360
<font color="yellow">It must have been so hard for her...</font>

381
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,660
<font color="yellow">to carry all that weight on her small shoulders.</font>

382
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,860
<font color="yellow">I didn't know this...</font>

383
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,120
<font color="yellow">and continued to spray more water on her.</font>

384
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,120
<font color="yellow">The cotton blanket that was so nice and soft...</font>

385
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,190
<font color="yellow">probably became disgusting.</font>

386
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,320
<font color="yellow">While the mother suffers from being thirsty,</font>

387
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,920
<font color="yellow">the child is suffering from the weight.</font>

388
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,200
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the piano for free.</font>

389
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,570
<font color="yellow">So don't withdraw your funds...</font>

390
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,440
<font color="yellow">and don't put your life on him.</font>

391
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,460
<font color="yellow">He'll die from the pressure.</font>

392
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,820
<font color="yellow">Our children are full of hopes,</font>

393
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,490
<font color="yellow">but us, mothers, shouldn't turn it into a nightmare.</font>

394
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,970
<font color="yellow">So how much faster can you play?</font>

395
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,390
<font color="yellow">I went up to 95 BPM,</font>

396
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,160
<font color="yellow">but there's still a long way to go.</font>

397
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,960
<font color="yellow">I have to bring it up to 135 BPM.</font>

398
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,890
<font color="yellow">But it's not easy.</font>

399
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,420
<font color="yellow">Cha Sik.</font>

400
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,860
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking.</font>

401
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,720
<font color="yellow">I don't want to own a building.</font>

402
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,090
<font color="yellow">What? Why not?</font>

403
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's because I'm used to paying rent.</font>

404
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,470
<font color="yellow">But if I become a landlord, I'd feel like I'm robbing people.</font>

405
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,970
<font color="yellow">It would make me feel bad.</font>

406
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,430
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

407
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,170
<font color="yellow">Then how about a barbecue place?</font>

408
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,340
<font color="yellow">You can be the owner of a huge barbecue restaurant.</font>

409
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,510
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

410
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,920
<font color="yellow">I'm shy. I don't like having too many people around.</font>

411
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,400
<font color="yellow">Then what do you want?</font>

412
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,740
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

413
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,970
<font color="yellow">I just want to participate in a writing competition...</font>

414
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,460
<font color="yellow">and become a writer.</font>

415
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,740
<font color="yellow">A writer?</font>

416
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,710
<font color="yellow">All right, you can be a writer. I'll help you publish...</font>

417
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,040
<font color="yellow">and open a party for your book at a hotel.</font>

418
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,630
<font color="yellow">That's better than being a landlord.</font>

419
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,940
<font color="yellow">Are you this clever because you're a writer?</font>

420
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,490
<font color="yellow">You are so classy.</font>

421
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,970
<font color="yellow">Even if he only played one song,</font>

422
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,320
<font color="yellow">isn't that really good for three months?</font>

423
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,190
<font color="yellow">Do you think maybe he really is Hyun Myung Sae's son?</font>

424
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,790
<font color="yellow">The competition is in a week, right?</font>

425
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,760
<font color="yellow">He might even win at this rate.</font>

426
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,140
<font color="yellow">Jin Mok might lose the bet after all.</font>

427
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,290
<font color="yellow">He's in a slump.</font>

428
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,470
<font color="yellow">Slump? No way.</font>

429
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,640
<font color="yellow">- He's not.
-  He is.</font>

430
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,820
<font color="yellow">He even looked into switching majors.</font>

431
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,240
<font color="yellow">Is he behind me?</font>

432
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

433
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,420
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

434
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,520
<font color="yellow">Look at him.</font>

435
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,170
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

436
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,490
<font color="yellow">Why did you stop?</font>

437
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,190
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

438
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,560
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

439
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,070
<font color="yellow">I just got a text from my mum.</font>

440
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,560
<font color="yellow">She asked me to come home right away.</font>

441
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,760
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

442
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,890
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

443
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,840
<font color="yellow">I think I should go.</font>

444
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,370
<font color="yellow">Can you go home on your own?</font>

445
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

446
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,490
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

447
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,790
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll come pick you up tomorrow.</font>

448
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,460
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

449
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,820
<font color="yellow">Dumber.</font>

450
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,460
<font color="yellow">Can you help me?</font>

451
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,560
<font color="yellow">Help you with what?</font>

452
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,600
<font color="yellow">Make me mad or teach me. Whatever you can will do.</font>

453
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,920
<font color="yellow">I have to win this competition.</font>

454
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

455
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,690
<font color="yellow">Why would I help you?</font>

456
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,160
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember our bet?</font>

457
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,560
<font color="yellow">Yoo Seul said...</font>

458
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,070
<font color="yellow">that if we win this competition,</font>

459
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,790
<font color="yellow">she'll continue playing the piano.</font>

460
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,890
<font color="yellow">What if you don't win?</font>

461
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,790
<font color="yellow">She'll really give up on it.</font>

462
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,590
<font color="yellow">You don't want that too, right?</font>

463
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,920
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I?</font>

464
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,860
<font color="yellow">We're enemies and she's always looking to put me down.</font>

465
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,920
<font color="yellow">I'd rather have her quit.</font>

466
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,820
<font color="yellow">I heard this cut...</font>

467
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,060
<font color="yellow">was from you beating up a kid who was taking her photo.</font>

468
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,990
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

469
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,300
<font color="yellow">What kind of crazy person,</font>

470
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,270
<font color="yellow">especially a pianist,</font>

471
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,170
<font color="yellow">decides to beat up someone else...</font>

472
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,220
<font color="yellow">for their enemy while getting their hand hurt?</font>

473
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:34,100
<font color="yellow">The number you're calling is currently not available.</font>

474
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,260
<font color="yellow">What? Why isn't he coming?</font>

475
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,270
<font color="yellow">Larva.</font>

476
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,060
<font color="yellow">"Larva". Please record your message.</font>

477
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,070
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you coming?</font>

478
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,590
<font color="yellow">Is everything okay?</font>

479
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,060
<font color="yellow">Is your mother okay?</font>

480
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,570
<font color="yellow">When will you pick me up tomorrow?</font>

481
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,270
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you coming?</font>

482
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,640
<font color="yellow">Answer the phone now! Are you sick?</font>

483
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,440
<font color="yellow">You didn't give up on the competition, did you?</font>

484
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,940
<font color="yellow">Are you playing hard to get?</font>

485
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,120
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

486
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,720
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Cha Sik?</font>

487
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,690
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

488
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,060
<font color="yellow">He hasn't been around for a while.</font>

489
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,340
<font color="yellow">I guarantee you...</font>

490
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,470
<font color="yellow">that you will look for me when I am not around,</font>

491
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,930
<font color="yellow">and you will be happy to hear my voice.</font>

492
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,590
<font color="yellow">- It's not like that!
-  Goodness!</font>

493
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,660
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

494
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,960
<font color="yellow">- Gyu Seon.
-  Yes?</font>

495
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,620
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

496
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,540
<font color="yellow">Can you send Cha Sik a text message with my phone?</font>

497
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

498
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,790
<font color="yellow">- I'm listening.
-  Jeong Cha Sik.</font>

499
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,390
<font color="yellow">This is your last warning.</font>

500
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,790
<font color="yellow">If you don't come...</font>

501
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,790
<font color="yellow">to our last practice at 10pm tonight,</font>

502
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,070
<font color="yellow">I will assume that...</font>

503
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,820
<font color="yellow">you ran away like a coward, and I won't enter the competition.</font>

504
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,660
<font color="yellow">Do as you please.</font>

505
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,920
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy.</font>

506
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,970
<font color="yellow">Why can't I do it?</font>

507
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,960
<font color="yellow">I should be able to play at this point.</font>

508
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,860
<font color="yellow">What do I do when tomorrow is the competition?</font>

509
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,260
<font color="yellow">Please help me, Father.</font>

510
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,890
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

511
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,420
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

512
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,090
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the academy.</font>

513
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,660
<font color="yellow">What academy?</font>

514
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,290
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the academy for college entrance exam.</font>

515
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,690
<font color="yellow">Good, you made the right decision.</font>

516
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,320
<font color="yellow">Even if you become a good pianist,</font>

517
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,990
<font color="yellow">all you can do is earn money as a piano instructor.</font>

518
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,520
<font color="yellow">But it isn't worth it to give up everything...</font>

519
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,330
<font color="yellow">just to become an instructor.</font>

520
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,460
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree?</font>

521
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,590
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

522
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,390
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

523
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,090
<font color="yellow">Current time is 10:10pm.</font>

524
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,970
<font color="yellow">Fine. Forget it.</font>

525
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,340
<font color="yellow">This is good because I was going to give up playing anyway.</font>

526
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,970
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I will be able to stop playing without any regrets!</font>

527
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,860
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Cha Sik!</font>

528
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,670
<font color="yellow">However, I'll wait five more minutes considering our friendship.</font>

529
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,190
<font color="yellow">Just five more minutes.</font>

530
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,230
<font color="yellow">We haven't known each other long enough...</font>

531
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,970
<font color="yellow">for you to consider our friendship.</font>

532
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,120
<font color="yellow">Cha Sik.</font>

533
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,340
<font color="yellow">Why did you come so late?</font>

534
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,900
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer my calls?</font>

535
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,260
<font color="yellow">You told me you would always protect me!</font>

536
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,970
<font color="yellow">So did you want to see me?</font>

537
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,390
<font color="yellow">Did you miss me?</font>

538
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,540
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

539
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,830
<font color="yellow">I didn't miss you at all.</font>

540
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,370
<font color="yellow">You sounded very desperate in your text messages.</font>

541
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,970
<font color="yellow">You desperately looked for me.</font>

542
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,830
<font color="yellow">I am not in the mood to joke around.</font>

543
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,790
<font color="yellow">Did you finish practising?</font>

544
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,260
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

545
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,720
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

546
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,720
<font color="yellow">Did you finish practising?</font>

547
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,890
<font color="yellow">Weren't you able to play it? Is that why you didn't show up?</font>

548
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,460
<font color="yellow">Tell her, no.</font>

549
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,220
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

550
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,490
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

551
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,590
<font color="yellow">Okay, I knew you would make it.</font>

552
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,560
<font color="yellow">- Play it.
-  What?</font>

553
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

554
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,290
<font color="yellow">Why don't you sound confident?</font>

555
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,270
<font color="yellow">Play the highlight first.</font>

556
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,620
<font color="yellow">You know where it is, right?</font>

557
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,060
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

558
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,040
<font color="yellow">You mean this part?</font>

559
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,590
<font color="yellow">The part that plays in two beats?</font>

560
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,120
<font color="yellow">Yes, play that part.</font>

561
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,920
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

562
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,430
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

563
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,840
<font color="yellow">The part that you're playing is the orchestra,</font>

564
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,990
<font color="yellow">and the part I am playing is the chorus.</font>

565
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,500
<font color="yellow">You must play the orchestra part loudly and clearly...</font>

566
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,830
<font color="yellow">for this piece to come to life.</font>

567
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,270
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

568
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,940
<font color="yellow">how can I manage to produce the sound of an orchestra?</font>

569
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,290
<font color="yellow">You must do it.</font>

570
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,600
<font color="yellow">You can't miss a note or get any of them mixed.</font>

571
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,060
<font color="yellow">You can't be offbeat either.</font>

572
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,330
<font color="yellow">If you play right, you can play...</font>

573
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,890
<font color="yellow">the scale of an orchestra.</font>

574
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,330
<font color="yellow">How was it?</font>

575
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,720
<font color="yellow">That was perfect.</font>

576
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,970
<font color="yellow">It was perfect. It was overwhelming.</font>

577
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,760
<font color="yellow">Even I wouldn't be able to play like that.</font>

578
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,640
<font color="yellow">Really? Was it that good?</font>

579
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,370
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think your decision to become a pianist...</font>

580
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,440
<font color="yellow">was the best decision you've ever made.</font>

581
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,090
<font color="yellow">No matter what happens, do not give up playing the piano. Okay?</font>

582
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,070
<font color="yellow">Can you repeat...</font>

583
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,360
<font color="yellow">what you just said?</font>

584
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,890
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

585
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,160
<font color="yellow">I was actually thinking of giving up.</font>

586
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,690
<font color="yellow">I wondered if I was overestimating myself.</font>

587
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,890
<font color="yellow">I was worried that I would only become an average pianist,</font>

588
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,370
<font color="yellow">so I kept questioning myself.</font>

589
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,830
<font color="yellow">Don't question yourself.</font>

590
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,600
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and don't give up.</font>

591
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,490
<font color="yellow">You definitely have the talent.</font>

592
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,200
<font color="yellow">I usually don't approve people,</font>

593
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,090
<font color="yellow">but I approve of you with all my heart.</font>

594
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,660
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to repeat what I said?</font>

595
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,630
<font color="yellow">10 times?</font>

596
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,830
<font color="yellow">No, I can repeat it 1,000 times.</font>

597
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,330
<font color="yellow">That is enough.</font>

598
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,890
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Yoo Seul.</font>

599
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,360
<font color="yellow">Dumber.</font>

600
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,530
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today.</font>

601
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,290
<font color="yellow">If you want to thank me, do whatever it takes...</font>

602
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,490
<font color="yellow">to make it either by going crazy or by practising.</font>

603
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,660
<font color="yellow">Win the prize at the competition tomorrow.</font>

604
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,290
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

605
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,290
<font color="yellow">stop calling me Dumber!</font>

606
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,500
<font color="yellow">Goodness, hello!</font>

607
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,990
<font color="yellow">I am Cha Sik's mother.</font>

608
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,620
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

609
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,400
<font color="yellow">I should have said hello...</font>

610
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,060
<font color="yellow">when I bought the piano.</font>

611
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,220
<font color="yellow">When do you mean?</font>

612
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,220
<font color="yellow">Isn't this our first time meeting?</font>

613
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,100
<font color="yellow">You drank soju...</font>

614
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,470
<font color="yellow">out of a wine glass.</font>

615
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,310
<font color="yellow">You got drunk and said you'd give me a free piano...</font>

616
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,070

617
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,040
<font color="yellow">- on the line for your child.
-  It wasn't me.</font>

618
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,740
<font color="yellow">You must have mistook me for someone else.</font>

619
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,970
<font color="yellow">Pardon me? It's definitely...</font>

620
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,240
<font color="yellow">First, I don't drink and behave that way.</font>

621
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,090
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have acted that way drunk.</font>

622
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,440
<font color="yellow">Second,</font>

623
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,800
<font color="yellow">I would never give away a piano for free.</font>

624
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,220
<font color="yellow">- Third,
-  You...</font>

625
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,590
<font color="yellow">You have a third point?</font>

626
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,360
<font color="yellow">I would never say...</font>

627
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,520
<font color="yellow">not to put everything on the line for your child.</font>

628
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,830
<font color="yellow">Wow, that evil woman...</font>

629
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,060
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who was dumb enough to pity her.</font>

630
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,520
<font color="yellow">What's... What's wrong? I didn't say anything.</font>

631
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,660
<font color="yellow">Don't tell my daughter that I'm here.</font>

632
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,120
<font color="yellow">She will feel pressured and run away.</font>

633
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,090
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't.</font>

634
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,620
<font color="yellow">The invited judge is Hyun Myung Sae?</font>

635
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,330
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

636
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,990
<font color="yellow">It's more impossible than Cristiano Ronaldo being the referee...</font>

637

<font color="yellow">for our soccer game in the neighbourhood.</font>

638
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,620
<font color="yellow">Why would he come to Korea of all places?</font>

639
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,890
<font color="yellow">Why would he come all the way from Austria just to be...</font>

640
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,200
<font color="yellow">the judge for...</font>

641
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,890
<font color="yellow">a preliminary piano competition?</font>

642
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,730
<font color="yellow">Why would he...</font>

643
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,120
<font color="yellow">- come here?
-  I am not sure.</font>

644
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,330
<font color="yellow">Isn't it one of the two?</font>

645
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,310
<font color="yellow">Either he has lost his mind,</font>

646
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,290
<font color="yellow">or he came to see Cha Sik.</font>

<font color="yellow">Do you know where Cha Sik is?</font>

652
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,630
<font color="yellow">He must be in the waiting room.</font>

653
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,060
<font color="yellow">But who are you?</font>

654

<font color="yellow">Do you want me to help you?</font>

688
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,820

00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,530
<font color="yellow">Aren't you nervous that your father is coming?</font>

<font color="yellow">What? My father?</font>

694

<font color="yellow">No. I believe it now.</font>

<font color="yellow">You are definitely his son.</font>

698
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,790
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

699
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,200
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

700
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,490
<font color="yellow">You don't sound confident at all.</font>

701
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,040
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Come to your senses.</font>

702
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,860
<font color="yellow">Just play like you did yesterday.</font>

703
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,260
<font color="yellow">Then your dad will approve of you.</font>

704
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,590
<font color="yellow">You might even get lucky, and he might find you talented.</font>

705
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,070
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be unfair...</font>

706
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,920
<font color="yellow">if he finds me talented instead of you?</font>

707
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,160
<font color="yellow">I might get a little upset, but I wouldn't find it unfair.</font>

708
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,360
<font color="yellow">I told you, I approve of you.</font>

709
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,190
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thanks.</font>

710
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,340
<font color="yellow">This doesn't mean I am giving up on myself.</font>

711
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,140
<font color="yellow">I'm also going to play my best.</font>

712
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,390

713
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,740
<font color="yellow">You wait and see.</font>

714
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,130
<font color="yellow">My performance will be beyond your imagination.</font>

715
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,070
<font color="yellow">I've improved immensely.</font>

716
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh, your lies are getting worse every day.</font>

717
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,400
<font color="yellow">I am not lying.</font>

718
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,660
<font color="yellow">Today is one of the few days in a year when I'm normal.</font>

719
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,290
<font color="yellow">Keep the promise you made last time.</font>

720
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,940
<font color="yellow">If you win, you won't give up...</font>

721
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,220
<font color="yellow">playing the piano.</font>

722
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,320
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

723
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,440
<font color="yellow">I guarantee you...</font>

724
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,220
<font color="yellow">that you will smile like this...</font>

<font color="yellow">after the competition.</font>

726
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,760
<font color="yellow">I will make sure of that.</font>

727
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't your trip to Korea take too long?</font>

728
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,390
<font color="yellow">It was okay.</font>

729
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,660
<font color="yellow">I beg your pardon,</font>

730
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,620
<font color="yellow">but I have something to tell you.</font>

731
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,290
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me.
-  Thank you.</font>

732
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,970
<font color="yellow">I can't believe there are reporters at this competition.</font>

733
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,290
<font color="yellow">There are even cameras.</font>

734
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,070
<font color="yellow">They aren't here for the competition.</font>

735
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,390
<font color="yellow">They're here for Professor Hyun Myung Sae.</font>

736
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,760
<font color="yellow">Cha Sik and Yoo Seul will win today.</font>

737
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,760
<font color="yellow">Win?</font>

738
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,590
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

739
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,720
<font color="yellow">It's based on my sixth sense.</font>

740
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,290
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>

741
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? The competition is starting soon.</font>

742
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,420
<font color="yellow">Jin Mok, I beg you.</font>

743
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,590
<font color="yellow">Please play instead of me.</font>

744
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,500
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I will be honest.</font>

745
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,240
<font color="yellow">You were right and I was wrong.</font>

746
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,670
<font color="yellow">I am neither Hyun Myung Sae's son...</font>

747
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,990
<font color="yellow">nor a genius. And I couldn't even play up to 135 BPM.</font>

748
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,070
<font color="yellow">At this rate,</font>

749
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,060
<font color="yellow">Yoo Seul's performance will be ruined.</font>

750
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:53,660
<font color="yellow">This performance may be once in a lifetime chance for her.</font>

751
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,960
<font color="yellow">I don't want to ruin it for her,</font>

752
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,790
<font color="yellow">so I beg you.</font>

753
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,500
<font color="yellow">Please play instead of me.</font>

754
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,800
<font color="yellow">You're crazy.</font>

755
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,370
<font color="yellow">Competitions aren't a joke.</font>

756
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,750
<font color="yellow">How can I play when your name is on the list?</font>

757
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,770
<font color="yellow">I put up your name instead of mine.</font>

758
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,500
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be possible for the final competition,</font>

759
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,160
<font color="yellow">but they let me since it's the preliminary.</font>

760
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,160
<font color="yellow">I still can't do it.</font>

761
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,250
<font color="yellow">I haven't memorised the piece...</font>

762
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,820
<font color="yellow">Can you play it if you have the music sheets?</font>

763
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,900
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

764
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,890
<font color="yellow">I will turn the pages.</font>

765
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,510
<font color="yellow">And this piece is composed by Beethoven arranged by Liszt,</font>

766
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,660
<font color="yellow">so it's the perfect piece to show your strength.</font>

767
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,760
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

768
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,090
<font color="yellow">Don't run away.</font>

769
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,890
<font color="yellow">And go on stage.</font>

770
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,120
<font color="yellow">I will help you.</font>

771
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,860

773
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,620
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will be fine.</font>

774
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,960

00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,000
<font color="yellow">I am really sorry.</font>

781
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,400
<font color="yellow">I told you already...</font>

782
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,640
<font color="yellow">that I want to be alone.</font>

783

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,300
<font color="yellow">You don't know...</font>

788
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,810
<font color="yellow">how many silly things I've done while believing in your lies.</font>

789
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:32,020
<font color="yellow">If you had known, you wouldn't have lied to me in the first place.</font>

790
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,570
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

791
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,040
<font color="yellow">how excited I was practising with Yoo Seul to become a pianist...</font>

792
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,570
<font color="yellow">while dreaming of something impossible?</font>

793
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,340
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do.</font>

794
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,240
<font color="yellow">Do you? Then you must've known my dream was impossible.</font>

795
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,700
<font color="yellow">And you must've known how miserable I'd be after realising it.</font>

796
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,310
<font color="yellow">- Cha Sik...
-  Why did you lie if you had known?</font>

797
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,460
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

798
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,220
<font color="yellow">Why did you go...</font>

799
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,090
<font color="yellow">to the rooftop of the hospital building?</font>

800
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,150
<font color="yellow">You were...</font>

801
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,070
<font color="yellow">thinking about doing something terrible like Yoo Seul did,</font>

802
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,220
<font color="yellow">right?</font>

803
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,720
<font color="yellow">I am so scared.</font>

804
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,660
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't find out?</font>

805
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,690
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make you feel better.</font>

806
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,820
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you that you are better than anyone,</font>

807
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,860
<font color="yellow">but I felt so pathetic.</font>

808
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,320
<font color="yellow">Is that why you lied?</font>

809
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,260
<font color="yellow">If...</font>

810
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,320
<font color="yellow">If I told you the truth,</font>

811
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,020
<font color="yellow">would I have made you feel better?</font>

812
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,220
<font color="yellow">Would you have felt better if I told you...</font>

813
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,890
<font color="yellow">that you will be fine because you take after me?</font>

814
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,060
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't take after me.</font>

815
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,100
<font color="yellow">What's the use of being...</font>

816
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,000
<font color="yellow">like me who's a ghostwriter?</font>

817
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,470
<font color="yellow">That's why I lied.</font>

818
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,870
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd give you strength if I said you took after someone great.</font>

819
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,760
<font color="yellow">That's why I lied.</font>

820
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,190

<font color="yellow">What you just said...</font>

823
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,530
<font color="yellow">makes me extremely upset.</font>

824
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,190
<font color="yellow">I've never felt this outraged in my life before.</font>

825
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,290
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Follow me!</font>

826
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,170
<font color="yellow">Next is participant number 17.</font>

827

<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to tell...</font>

830
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,170
<font color="yellow">Yoo Seul that you're here?</font>

831
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,310
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

832
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,690
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, it wouldn't be her choice to be here.</font>

833
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,120
<font color="yellow">I know this won't happen,</font>

834
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,840
<font color="yellow">but if you make a mistake intentionally like last time,</font>

835
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,290
<font color="yellow">you won't ever perform again.</font>

836
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,360
<font color="yellow">I will pull out all of your hair.</font>

837
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,620
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do for me if I don't make a mistake?</font>

838
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,120
<font color="yellow">A compliment.</font>

839
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,250
<font color="yellow">Did you ask if I would have felt better...</font>

840
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,430
<font color="yellow">if you had said that I took after you?</font>

841
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,860
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully. This is my answer.</font>

842
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,430
<font color="yellow">I am playing...</font>

843

848
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,520
<font color="yellow">You may be right.</font>

849
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,240
<font color="yellow">I might become...</font>

850
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,540
<font color="yellow">an average piano instructor because I'm not talented.</font>

857
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, I don't care.</font>

858
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,370
<font color="yellow">It's more important for me...</font>
