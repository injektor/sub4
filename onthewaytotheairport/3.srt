20
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,173
<font color="yellow">Did you bring her stuff?</font>

21
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,133
<font color="yellow">Yes. Someone helped me with them.</font>

22
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,703

26
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:30,603
<font color="yellow">Can we meet up?</font>

27
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,503

<font color="yellow">Did you bring her home?</font>

35
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:56,873
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

36
00:06:57,003 --> 00:07:00,073
<font color="yellow">Seok told me all about it.</font>

37
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:03,733
<font color="yellow">That someone packed Annie's things.</font>

38
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,533
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

39
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,573
<font color="yellow">What a nice thing to do.</font>

40
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,003
<font color="yellow">Go and get some rest.</font>

41
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:30,533
<font color="yellow">Did it rain?</font>

42
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:33,073
<font color="yellow">There's a wet umbrella outside.</font>

43
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,873
<font color="yellow">Didn't it rain here?</font>

44
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:36,973
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

45
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:45,503
<font color="yellow">Seoul's quite a large city.</font>

46
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,533
<font color="yellow">You just got back.</font>

47
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,233
<font color="yellow">Why didn't I think of that?</font>

48
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,603
<font color="yellow">It rained somewhere else.</font>

49
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:06,603
<font color="yellow">Like Incheon.</font>

50
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:21,633
<font color="yellow">Don't come back.</font>

51
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,433
<font color="yellow">No. I want to go home.</font>

52
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:28,203
<font color="yellow">I did well. I can do well. I won't make a mistake.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hye Won.</font>

54
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,333
<font color="yellow">I promised my mum.</font>

55
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:53,243
<font color="yellow">Throw everything away.</font>

56
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,833
<font color="yellow">Will you go through all this with me?</font>

57
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,103
<font color="yellow">Will we read her diary and wonder what to keep...</font>

58
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:03,403
<font color="yellow">and what not to?</font>

59
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,573
<font color="yellow">What if we find something hateful about me?</font>

60
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,333
<font color="yellow">What if she wrote about me?</font>

61
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:11,433
<font color="yellow">I wasn't that good a mum when I raised her alone.</font>

62
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:14,503
<font color="yellow">I had her when I'd barely turned 20...</font>

63
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,973
<font color="yellow">and I juggled work, study and childcare.</font>

64
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,403
<font color="yellow">I took her to her dad then brought her back many times.</font>

65
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,573
<font color="yellow">Each time we both cried our eyes out.</font>

66
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:27,103
<font color="yellow">How can I live if she wrote hateful things about me?</font>

67
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:30,573
<font color="yellow">You brought her back. Leave it at that.</font>

68
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:34,203
<font color="yellow">It was never like this between us.</font>

69
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,903
<font color="yellow">Please... I want to stop screaming.</font>

70
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:44,033
<font color="yellow">Get rid of everything for me.</font>

71
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,103
<font color="yellow">I need to make one thing very clear.</font>

72
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:55,103
<font color="yellow">You raised Annie and her father neglected her.</font>

73
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:58,373
<font color="yellow">That alone means you did your duty.</font>

74
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,273
<font color="yellow">Maybe Annie did hate you.</font>

75
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,473
<font color="yellow">She never said she did,</font>

76
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:05,303
<font color="yellow">but even if she did, you did nothing wrong.</font>

77
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:12,243
<font color="yellow">I know very well how you lived.</font>

78
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,273
<font color="yellow">Stop talking about guilt.</font>

79
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,773
<font color="yellow">You did nothing wrong. You shouldn't feel guilty.</font>

80
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,573
<font color="yellow">- I will take everything away. - Leave it.</font>

81
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,133
<font color="yellow">I want...</font>

82
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,243
<font color="yellow">to go through it all.</font>

83
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,603
<font color="yellow">I keep screaming and yelling.</font>

84
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,133
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me?</font>

85
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:51,103
<font color="yellow">I heard that Soo Ah even irons Captain Park's pyjamas.</font>

86
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:53,743
<font color="yellow">Men cheat on wives who iron their underwear.</font>

87
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:56,603
<font color="yellow">She's the Iron Lady who gets walked all over.</font>

88
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,067
<font color="yellow">Iron Lady.</font>

89
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:13,637
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

90
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,637
<font color="yellow">That's what the others are calling you.</font>

91
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,897
<font color="yellow">Is that a compliment?</font>

92
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,537
<font color="yellow">I do appear steely and stern.</font>

93
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:24,797
<font color="yellow">It means you iron clothes.</font>

94
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:28,697
<font color="yellow">They're talking about me, then.</font>

95
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,397
<font color="yellow">They say you iron the hotel's pillowcases,</font>

96
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:32,797
<font color="yellow">sleep on the iron...</font>

97
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:35,437
<font color="yellow">and might murder your husband with it.</font>

98
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,797
<font color="yellow">That's just scary.</font>

99
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,197
<font color="yellow">Why do you have an iron in your bag?</font>

100
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,497
<font color="yellow">Does anyone say why?</font>

101
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:44,797
<font color="yellow">Doh Woo's daughter died in an accident.</font>

102
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,737
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

103
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:49,097
<font color="yellow">Isn't that terrible?</font>

104
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:51,467
<font color="yellow">The iron was his daughter's.</font>

105
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:54,097
<font color="yellow">The landlady was about to throw everything away.</font>

106
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:56,767
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

107
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,137
<font color="yellow">We should cheer Doh Woo up.</font>

108
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04,037
<font color="yellow">You haven't met him yet, have you? Keep the iron safe.</font>

109
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:05,867
<font color="yellow">You can give it to him then.</font>

110
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:07,797
<font color="yellow">We've met already.</font>

111
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,437
<font color="yellow">How? When?</font>

112
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,437
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

113
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,097
<font color="yellow">The airport, rain, early morning.</font>

114
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:25,967
<font color="yellow">It was only a few hours ago,</font>

115
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:28,997
<font color="yellow">but that's all I remember.</font>

116
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,297
<font color="yellow">I only have really old photos.</font>

117

<font color="yellow">(Hyo Eun's Mum)</font>

118
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,967
<font color="yellow">I found a few photos.</font>

119
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:18,597
<font color="yellow">Can you see me from where you are?</font>

120
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,937
<font color="yellow">You must be able to see me.</font>

121
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:24,037
<font color="yellow">You sent just what I needed.</font>

122
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,237
<font color="yellow">There are so many nice photos.</font>

123
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,967
<font color="yellow">They're just what I needed. Thank you.</font>

124
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,597
<font color="yellow">She's the real deal.</font>

125
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,797
<font color="yellow">She just kicks a ball around. She won't join a team.</font>

126
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:06,037
<font color="yellow">That's not just kicking, that's dribbling.</font>

127
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,067
<font color="yellow">She takes after us.</font>

128
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,737
<font color="yellow">And to think that she loved anything pink a while ago.</font>

129
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,667
<font color="yellow">She'd wear nothing but pink.</font>

130
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,097
<font color="yellow">She loved ballet.</font>

131
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:18,067
<font color="yellow">The football phase won't last.</font>

132
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:20,567
<font color="yellow">Kids betray you all the time.</font>

133
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,567
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

134
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,867
<font color="yellow">It would've been nice...</font>

135
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,397
<font color="yellow">if you worked this hard when Mum was alive.</font>

136
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:28,667
<font color="yellow">Not again.</font>

137
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,897
<font color="yellow">She's watching from above.</font>

138
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,837
<font color="yellow">That's what keeps me going.</font>

139
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,767
<font color="yellow">She'd be pleased to see you with Hyo Eun.</font>

140
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,067
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll babysit.</font>

141
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,967
<font color="yellow">She's my only niece, isn't she?</font>

142
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:40,697
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

143
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,197
<font color="yellow">55 dollars a day.</font>

144
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:43,367
<font color="yellow">And five for transportation.</font>

145
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,297
<font color="yellow">I have to spend an hour on the bus and subway.</font>

146
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:46,337
<font color="yellow">Pay in advance.</font>

147
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,397
<font color="yellow">Throw in free football lessons starting then.</font>

148
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:50,537
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

149
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:53,597
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun, start from there.</font>

150
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:54,967
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

151
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,367
<font color="yellow">There's no one here.</font>

152
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,597
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

153
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,897
<font color="yellow">Is anyone in?</font>

154
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:13,337
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

155
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,297
<font color="yellow">Why are there no lectures all of a sudden?</font>

156
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,667
<font color="yellow">You had one every week on Wednesdays.</font>

157
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,767
<font color="yellow">We don't have a set schedule.</font>

158
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,837
<font color="yellow">Ms Go just teaches if anyone's there to listen.</font>

160
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,567
<font color="yellow">It was free of charge and spontaneous.</font>

161
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,637
<font color="yellow">Can she do what she wants if it's free?</font>

162
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:34,897
<font color="yellow">I can give you the number of another academy.</font>

163
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:37,837
<font color="yellow">You have to pay but they stick to a schedule.</font>

164
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,737
<font color="yellow">Must I pay to learn this?</font>

165
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:44,137
<font color="yellow">Ms Go is a human cultural asset.</font>

166
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,867
<font color="yellow">She taught those who were interested...</font>

167
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,237
<font color="yellow">to give back to the community.</font>

168
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,067
<font color="yellow">It's an experience, not a lecture.</font>

169
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,167
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

170
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,567
<font color="yellow">I care a lot about class and virtue.</font>

171
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,597
<font color="yellow">I value our traditional arts.</font>

172
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,837
<font color="yellow">But this is just wrong.</font>

173

<font color="yellow">Human cultural assets eat three meals a day.</font>

174
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,867
<font color="yellow">You should stick to a schedule.</font>

175
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,937
<font color="yellow">Giving back to the community is a given.</font>

176
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,767
<font color="yellow">Nothing in the world is a given.</font>

177
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,697
<font color="yellow">She did it out of goodwill.</font>

178
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:20,767
<font color="yellow">I took time out of my busy schedule to come here.</font>

179
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:24,407
<font color="yellow">How dare she complain that...</font>

180
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,597
<font color="yellow">it's not a regular event when it's for free?</font>

181
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,867
<font color="yellow">How could she say that?</font>

182
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,867
<font color="yellow">People don't value what's for free.</font>

183
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,137
<font color="yellow">Hello, Captain Park.</font>

184
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,567
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

185
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,667
<font color="yellow">You arrived safely in Sydney?</font>

186
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:45,067
<font color="yellow">Why would you call to tell me that?</font>

187
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:50,067
<font color="yellow">What... What?</font>

188
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,467
<font color="yellow">Come on!</font>

189
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,267

00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,667
<font color="yellow">They only took your and Hyo Eun's stuff.</font>

199
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,167
<font color="yellow">Move in with my mum.</font>

200
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,867
<font color="yellow">Why? What for?</font>

201
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,337
<font color="yellow">I sent you a manual.</font>

202
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:52,197
<font color="yellow">Your mother died,</font>

203
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,997
<font color="yellow">then New Zealand and Malaysia happened.</font>

204
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,167
<font color="yellow">We need help to break the cycle.</font>

205
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:57,997
<font color="yellow">We could've discussed this.</font>

206
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,197
<font color="yellow">Did you discuss bringing Hyo Eun back?</font>

207
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:02,797
<font color="yellow">You're lucky I persuaded my mum.</font>

208
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,997
<font color="yellow">I'll put Hyo Eun on.</font>

209
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,797

<font color="yellow">Don't give me that look.</font>

224

<font color="yellow">Half of it is pity.</font>

225
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:54,267

<font color="yellow">I'll pay for you two in return.</font>

321
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,281
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting so friendly?</font>

322
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:39,341

325
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,581
<font color="yellow">I just want to know what's wrong.</font>

326
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:11,911

335
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:15,811
<font color="yellow">How is work?</font>

336
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:17,641
<font color="yellow">It's pretty tough, actually.</font>

337
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,811
<font color="yellow">And the next day, too.</font>

338
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,411
<font color="yellow">My seniors are scary, too.</font>

339

340
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:27,411
<font color="yellow">Of course we talked about serious things,</font>

<font color="yellow">Anyway...</font>

343
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,681
<font color="yellow">Do you always stay in this room?</font>

344
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,041
<font color="yellow">This room feels more like home.</font>

345
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:42,381
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if this is home or if home is my work.</font>

346
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:44,011
<font color="yellow">I sometimes get confused.</font>

347
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:48,111
<font color="yellow">I also learned about your loneliness...</font>

348
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:50,441
<font color="yellow">so I did get to know you better.</font>

349
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,441
<font color="yellow">Take the call.</font>

350
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:11,241
<font color="yellow">I want to know what I did wrong.</font>

353
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,881

355
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:32,811
<font color="yellow">So that was earlier today.</font>

356
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,511
<font color="yellow">It's only been 12 hours...</font>

360
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:59,111
<font color="yellow">We did talk. We talked about many things.</font>

361
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:02,341
<font color="yellow">Some women believe they know a guy just because...</font>

362
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:04,281
<font color="yellow">they talked to him and they bring him coffee.</font>

363

<font color="yellow">That's the worse kind of women.</font>

364
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:09,611
<font color="yellow">I want to ask you the same question.</font>

365
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,781
<font color="yellow">Did I do something to lead you on?</font>

366
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:18,141
<font color="yellow">I'm letting you off...</font>

367
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,241

<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

571
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:55,641
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

<font color="yellow">Do you remember how shocked I was?</font>

575
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:08,381
<font color="yellow">And then...</font>

576
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:14,511
<font color="yellow">Nobody understood you back when we were students.</font>

577
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:18,181
<font color="yellow">I know you get things done by yourself,</font>

578
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,111
<font color="yellow">but you can go easy on yourself at a time like this.</font>

<font color="yellow">People are talking about you.</font>

580
00:50:23,841 --> 00:50:26,081

584
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:36,311
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be able to tell you.</font>

585
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,311
<font color="yellow">I could never share my true feelings.</font>

586
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,641
<font color="yellow">It hurts too much to even bring it up.</font>

587
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,281
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

588

<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

590
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,881
