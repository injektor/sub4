00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,840
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Did you receive a call from Soo Ah?</font>

8
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,610
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

9
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,970
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't come even if I asked you. Would you?</font>

10
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,270
<font color="yellow">I'll be there.</font>

11
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,140
<font color="yellow">That's why family is more important...</font>

12
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,010
<font color="yellow">as you age.</font>

13
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,610
<font color="yellow">I hated your father so much...</font>

14
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,010
<font color="yellow">but I'm glad I stuck around.</font>

15
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,310
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the food.</font>

16
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,040
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

17
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,840
<font color="yellow">You don't have anything to do at home, anyway.</font>

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,370
<font color="yellow">I have to rest after my overnight flight.</font>

19
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,710
<font color="yellow">I have decided to live elsewhere.</font>

20
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,640
<font color="yellow">I'll give this house to you.</font>

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,870
<font color="yellow">Give me the deposit from your house.</font>

22
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,610
<font color="yellow">I'm moving to New Zealand to live with Jin Sook.</font>

23
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,640
<font color="yellow">So bring in all of your family from Jeju Island...</font>

24
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,710
<font color="yellow">and live here together.</font>

25
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,070
<font color="yellow">They can move in after the reconstruction.</font>

26
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,710
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun would be finished with high school by then.</font>

27
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,870
<font color="yellow">No, right now.</font>

28
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,540
<font color="yellow">Captain Park, don't you get it?</font>

29
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,070
<font color="yellow">Why do you think Soo Ah is...</font>

30
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,240
<font color="yellow">all the way in Jeju Island after quitting her job?</font>

31
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,610
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Hyo Eun? No.</font>

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,940
<font color="yellow">Soo Ah is living away from you.</font>

33
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,570
<font color="yellow">She knows.</font>

34
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,040
<font color="yellow">She knows about you and me.</font>

35
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,310
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to live with her, either.</font>

36
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,470
<font color="yellow">I was thinking that this was perfect.</font>

37
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,310
<font color="yellow">You don't want to live with her?</font>

38
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,910
<font color="yellow">Are you two getting a divorce?</font>

39
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,070
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Not everyone like us gets a divorce.</font>

40
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,510
<font color="yellow">People just live like this.</font>

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,570
<font color="yellow">She just needs some air...</font>

42
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,970
<font color="yellow">until Hyo Eun gets into a dorm.</font>

43
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,110
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun isn't going to an international school.</font>

44
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,570
<font color="yellow">She's going to a local school.</font>

45
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,470
<font color="yellow">How did she get in?</font>

46
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,970
<font color="yellow">In just two days?</font>

47
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,210
<font color="yellow">It doesn't happen that easily.</font>

48
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,070
<font color="yellow">You managed to send her to Malaysia in two days.</font>

49
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
<font color="yellow">You like it.</font>

50
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,440
<font color="yellow">Don't you? You didn't want to live with me.</font>

51
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,970
<font color="yellow">She knows. She knows about you and me.</font>

52
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,740
<font color="yellow">Are you scared that I'll be back so soon?</font>

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,070
<font color="yellow">Choi Soo Ah. That's why you were so confident.</font>

54
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,310
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Annie's mum.</font>

55
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,870
<font color="yellow">I want to make a visit. Are you home?</font>

56
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,940
<font color="yellow">What's with her?</font>

57
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,010
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

58
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,010
<font color="yellow">I called ahead to say you're coming.</font>

59
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,570
<font color="yellow">You'll be expected.</font>

60
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,910
<font color="yellow">We owe the person a lot.</font>

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,810
<font color="yellow">Your visit is very overdue.</font>

62
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
<font color="yellow">Hye Won.</font>

63
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

64
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,110
<font color="yellow">She'll make a comeback with Mi Jin...</font>

65
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,040
<font color="yellow">if I bring up Hyo Eun's school.</font>

66
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,010
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Hello.</font>

67
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,610
<font color="yellow">We met briefly in Sydney.</font>

68
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,040
<font color="yellow">I'm Annie's mum.</font>

69
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,740
<font color="yellow">I just caught your text. I was busy.</font>

70
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,640
<font color="yellow">I have to show you our gratitude.</font>

71
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,570
<font color="yellow">You said thanks last time.</font>

72
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
<font color="yellow">If you showed your gratitude to my wife, it's done.</font>

73
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,340
<font color="yellow">This is something my husband and I are thankful for.</font>

74
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,640
<font color="yellow">Your wife treated...</font>

75
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,070
<font color="yellow">my mother-in-law before she passed away.</font>

76
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,070
<font color="yellow">How are they acquainted?</font>

77
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,770
<font color="yellow">It's an uncanny relationship.</font>

78
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,440
<font color="yellow">I couldn't believe it, either.</font>

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,810
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the thought,</font>

80
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,070
<font color="yellow">but my wife isn't home.</font>

81
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,470
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

82
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,710
<font color="yellow">But something just came up for me, too.</font>

83
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,140
<font color="yellow">Only Doh Woo will be there.</font>

84
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,070
<font color="yellow">My husband. Suh Doh Woo.</font>

86
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,210
<font color="yellow">Your husband must be very loving.</font>

87
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,410
<font color="yellow">You can just take what we have prepared.</font>

88
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,170
<font color="yellow">Please open the door for him. Goodbye.</font>

89
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,110
<font color="yellow">My gosh. This is annoying.</font>

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

91
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,370
<font color="yellow">Someone very thankful.</font>

92
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,270
<font color="yellow">The person who bought your mum...</font>

93
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,910
<font color="yellow">patjuk before she died.</font>

<font color="yellow">(ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT)</font>

95
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,510
<font color="yellow">My house is such a mess with my wife and my child gone.</font>

96
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,740
<font color="yellow">She left this on the veranda.</font>

97
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,810
<font color="yellow">It's as good as hiding it.</font>

98
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,410
<font color="yellow">Before my mum died,</font>

99
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,440
<font color="yellow">your wife treated her with food.</font>

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,840
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to visit you so late.</font>

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

102
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,170
<font color="yellow">You should've said he couldn't keep a family.</font>

103
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,470
<font color="yellow">That he will even hate me for breathing and walking.</font>

104
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,140
<font color="yellow">Just as he dated me when he was with you,</font>

105
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,740
<font color="yellow">that he will continuously be having affairs.</font>

106
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,240
<font color="yellow">That I won't be a part of his life very soon.</font>

107
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,310
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me? Why? Why?</font>

108
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

109
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,880
<font color="yellow">You should put this somewhere you can see well.</font>

110
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,110
<font color="yellow">Isn't it odd?</font>

111
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,510
<font color="yellow">I guess you two had a fight...</font>

112
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,380
<font color="yellow">about who should come over.</font>

113
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,640
<font color="yellow">I'll tell your wife you were nice...</font>

114
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,540
<font color="yellow">if she calls me again.</font>

115
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

116
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,410
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't let her have her way all the time.</font>

117
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,380
<font color="yellow">It'll never end.</font>

118
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,140
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

119
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,210
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

120
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,640
<font color="yellow">I can see you.</font>

121
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,610
<font color="yellow">How was that?</font>

122
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,340
<font color="yellow">You probably couldn't say or do anything.</font>

123
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,540
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to be like this?</font>

124
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,240
<font color="yellow">Why does someone like you have to live like this?</font>

125
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,940
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I went to Jeju Island?</font>

126
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,540
<font color="yellow">I went there to give you a divorce.</font>

127
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,010
<font color="yellow">The divorce that you wanted so badly.</font>

128
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,710
<font color="yellow">Is that his wife or a girlfriend?</font>

129
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,640
<font color="yellow">Can you go fight somewhere else, Doh Woo?</font>

130
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,740
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

131
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,910
<font color="yellow">a man named Suh Doh Woo?</font>

132
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,540
<font color="yellow">Your wife helped him out a lot.</font>

133
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,410
<font color="yellow">Doh Woo was grateful.</font>

134
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,570
<font color="yellow">Can we call this a marriage?</font>

135
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,140
<font color="yellow">She was having a long and serious conversation...</font>

136
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,710
<font color="yellow">with a man on the plane.</font>

137
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,440
<font color="yellow">Can we call ourselves a married couple?</font>

138
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,410
<font color="yellow">Get yourself together before you ruin your family.</font>

139
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,810
<font color="yellow">What am I to you?</font>

140
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,540
<font color="yellow">Some coincidence, right?</font>

141
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,140
<font color="yellow">What kind of bad joke is this?</font>

142
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,940
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense.</font>

143
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,170
<font color="yellow">It doesn't.</font>

144
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,010
<font color="yellow">You saw him yourself.</font>

145
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,870
<font color="yellow">He looked happy, didn't he?</font>

146
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,610
<font color="yellow">That man...</font>

147
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,640
<font color="yellow">has no idea what kind of life his wife is living.</font>

148
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,740
<font color="yellow">You have no chance against him.</font>

149
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,310
<font color="yellow">I don't want him to hurt you.</font>

150
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,740
<font color="yellow">You're still my husband.</font>

151
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,170
<font color="yellow">I won't let you be despised by anyone.</font>

152
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,170
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be like this?</font>

153
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,270
<font color="yellow">This isn't why I wanted to give you a divorce.</font>

154
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,910
<font color="yellow">You're worrying about her right now, aren't you?</font>

155
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,710
<font color="yellow">You probably think I showed her contempt.</font>

156
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,640
<font color="yellow">I did. She received that from me.</font>

157
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,740
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

158
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,840
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

159
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,940
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter any more.</font>

160
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,640
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to be put in the same spot as her.</font>

161
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,770
<font color="yellow">I can't take it any more.</font>

162

<font color="yellow">Get it together, Doh Woo.</font>

163
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,540
<font color="yellow">Ms Hong found out about everything.</font>

164
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,770
<font color="yellow">Like she always does.</font>

165
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,910
<font color="yellow">She could erase my existence with a single phone call.</font>

166
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,470
<font color="yellow">So I went running for you.</font>

167
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,970
<font color="yellow">Only to find...</font>

168
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,110
<font color="yellow">her.</font>

169
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,340
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun's mum.</font>

170
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,470
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

171
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,570
<font color="yellow">How dare you open the door?</font>

172
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,410
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

173
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,410
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

174
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,910
<font color="yellow">I said she'll haunt you for the rest of your life.</font>

175
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,740
<font color="yellow">That's what I told her.</font>

176
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,340
<font color="yellow">After I finished school and gave birth to Eun Woo,</font>

177
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,240
<font color="yellow">we stayed together for just two days.</font>

178
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,110
<font color="yellow">It's the first time, isn't it?</font>

179
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,870
<font color="yellow">I'm finally speaking my mind.</font>

180
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,340
<font color="yellow">I gave birth to her out of love.</font>

181
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,540
<font color="yellow">But when I did,</font>

182
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,270
<font color="yellow">I got scared.</font>

183
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,910
<font color="yellow">People told me she'd be my life,</font>

184
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,210
<font color="yellow">but that wasn't the case for me.</font>

185
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,140
<font color="yellow">I felt like it was the end of my life.</font>

186
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,970
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even talk to my mum about it.</font>

187
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,570
<font color="yellow">I was very depressed.</font>

188
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,270
<font color="yellow">That's when Eun Woo's dad said...</font>

189
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,970
<font color="yellow">he would raise her.</font>

190
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,640
<font color="yellow">He said I could forget everything if I wanted.</font>

191
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,270
<font color="yellow">I agreed right away.</font>

192
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,370
<font color="yellow">My job helped me forget everything.</font>

193
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,170
<font color="yellow">That part of my life was...</font>

194
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,510
<font color="yellow">completely erased from my memory.</font>

195
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,310
<font color="yellow">When Eun Woo's dad was diagnosed with cancer,</font>

196
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,340
<font color="yellow">he said he had a 50 percent chance to live.</font>

197
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,410
<font color="yellow">I was just starting my dream job...</font>

198
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,370
<font color="yellow">working for Ms Go.</font>

199
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,640
<font color="yellow">"Why now?"</font>

200
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
<font color="yellow">I blamed him.</font>

201
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,610
<font color="yellow">Then something amazing happened.</font>

202
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,970
<font color="yellow">When I met Eun Woo for the first time,</font>

203
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,870
<font color="yellow">you came up to me...</font>

204
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,540
<font color="yellow">and said hello.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

206
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,110

<font color="yellow">That day,</font>

208
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,470
<font color="yellow">I remembered a part of my life...</font>

209
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,740
<font color="yellow">that I thought was gone forever.</font>

210
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,640
<font color="yellow">She's my daughter.</font>

211
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,710
<font color="yellow">I regretted that I told you she was my daughter.</font>

212
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,240
<font color="yellow">I knew you still would've accepted me. I regretted.</font>

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,340
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

214
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,510
<font color="yellow">Now that I think of it,</font>

215
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,370
<font color="yellow">I think it was the best thing I did for her,</font>

216
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,840
<font color="yellow">to call her my daughter.</font>

00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,610
<font color="yellow">Soo Ah, you're awesome!</font>

314
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,070
<font color="yellow">I've always been awesome.</font>

315
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,970
<font color="yellow">You're still Jin Seok's wife.</font>

316
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,410
<font color="yellow">I won't do that any more!</font>

317
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,170
<font color="yellow">- All right!
- All right!</font>

318
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,710
<font color="yellow">You're so awesome, my friend.</font>

319
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,940
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

320
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
<font color="yellow">Where's Hyo Eun?</font>

321
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,070
<font color="yellow">She's asleep.</font>

322
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,010
<font color="yellow">That's a relief. Thanks.</font>

323
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,010
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

324
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,110
<font color="yellow">Look at you two. You're both single.</font>

325
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,270
<font color="yellow">You two should go and grab a drink.</font>

326
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,640
<font color="yellow">A drink? No thanks. It's too late.</font>

327
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

328
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,610
<font color="yellow">Get her.</font>

329
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,710
<font color="yellow">I called her here for you.</font>

330
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,710
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

331
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,270
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun didn't even wake up once.</font>

332
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,370
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

333
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,340
<font color="yellow">You should pick up Mi Jin tomorrow.</font>

334
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,410
<font color="yellow">You can spend some time with her on the way over.</font>

335
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

336
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,310
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

337
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
<font color="yellow">You heard me...</font>

338
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,940
<font color="yellow">talk to Mi Jin on the phone, right?</font>

339
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,910
<font color="yellow">She didn't do anything wrong.</font>

340
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,240
<font color="yellow">I blamed her for nothing.</font>

341
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,870
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

342
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,110
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

343
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,640
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

344
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,810
<font color="yellow">I'm at Hyun Woo's.</font>

345
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,370
<font color="yellow">Do you remember...</font>

346
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,510
<font color="yellow">when I said this...</font>

347
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,410
<font color="yellow">on the phone?</font>

348
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,610
<font color="yellow">"I'm not sure if this will comfort you."</font>

349
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,740
<font color="yellow">"I'm not sure if this will comfort you."</font>

350
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,440
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if this will comfort you.</font>

351
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,810
<font color="yellow">But my daughter loves it there.</font>

352
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,970
<font color="yellow">She won't even call.</font>

353
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,940
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even want to come to Korea.</font>

354
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,970
<font color="yellow">That does comfort me.</font>

355
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,140
<font color="yellow">That was the first time you comforted me.</font>

356
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,310
<font color="yellow">When's the second time?</font>

357
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,070
<font color="yellow">"That's the best compliment I ever got."</font>

358
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,840
<font color="yellow">When your concerns melt away...</font>

359
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,010
<font color="yellow">with a breeze of wind, and you begin to think...</font>

360
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,970
<font color="yellow">"There's nothing much to life."</font>

361
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,470
<font color="yellow">"I just have to enjoy each moment."</font>

362
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,510
<font color="yellow">It's a moment...</font>

363
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,870
<font color="yellow">when you are energised.</font>

364
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,710
<font color="yellow">You are like that moment, Doh Woo.</font>

365
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,810
<font color="yellow">That's the best compliment I ever got.</font>

366
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,370
<font color="yellow">I remember. You told me that.</font>

367
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,540
<font color="yellow">When's the third time?</font>

368
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,340
<font color="yellow">Do you remember Seoul in November?</font>

369
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,110
<font color="yellow">It's when we wrap things up.</font>

370

<font color="yellow">really confused there.</font>

375
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,040
<font color="yellow">A little bit.</font>

376
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,210
<font color="yellow">What you have on your mind right now...</font>

377
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,640
<font color="yellow">may be right.</font>

378
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,540
<font color="yellow">This is a special place.</font>

379
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,040
<font color="yellow">That's where your everyday life is.</font>

380
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,240
<font color="yellow">Whatever you feel there and your confusion are...</font>

381
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,910
<font color="yellow">probably right.</font>

382
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,140
<font color="yellow">It's probably not because...</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll be fine so...</font>

386
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,640
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

387
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,770
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't come back.</font>

388
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,970
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

389
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
<font color="yellow">I met your wife...</font>

390
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,140
<font color="yellow">a few days ago.</font>

391
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,770
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

393
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,470

394
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,570
<font color="yellow">Were you at my house?</font>

395
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,410
<font color="yellow">Things just happened.</font>

396
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,140
<font color="yellow">I met your husband.</font>

397
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,240
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

398
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,570
<font color="yellow">He thinks that I came by to say thank you...</font>

399
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,640
<font color="yellow">for giving my mum patjuk before she passed away.</font>

400
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,610
<font color="yellow">What do I have to do...</font>

401
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,140
<font color="yellow">to make this...</font>

402

405
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,370
<font color="yellow">that's all I'm thinking about.</font>

406
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,070
<font color="yellow">Looks like it didn't work.</font>

407
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,210
<font color="yellow">We should talk more when I get there.</font>

00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,710
<font color="yellow">Even I know that.</font>

469
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,310
<font color="yellow">Your mum will be...</font>

470
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,340
<font color="yellow">truly happy from now on.</font>

471
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,310
<font color="yellow">Keep watching her closely.</font>

<font color="yellow">(HAN RIVER WATERFRONT)</font>

473
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,840
<font color="yellow">Cheer up. The sky is beautiful.</font>

474
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,010
<font color="yellow">I have so much to say.</font>

475
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,370
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

476
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,340
<font color="yellow">Stop doing that with your chopsticks.</font>

477
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,510
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

<font color="yellow">(CAPTAIN PARK)</font>

479
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,410
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

480
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,770
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

481
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,640
<font color="yellow">I saw your sister in Jeju Island. We made up.</font>

482
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,210
<font color="yellow">I thought of you while I was there.</font>

483
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,640
<font color="yellow">Consider yourself lucky.</font>

484
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,170
<font color="yellow">I'd prefer money over food.</font>

485
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,640
<font color="yellow">I wanted to drink.</font>

486
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,270
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

487
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:21,310
<font color="yellow">I'm just asking to make sure.</font>

488
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,110
<font color="yellow">I have many older women lined up for me already.</font>

489
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but the line is full.</font>

490
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,810
<font color="yellow">I still remember when you got sent to the army.</font>

491
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,370
<font color="yellow">You're all grown up now, aren't you?</font>

492
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,110
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. There are people here.</font>

493
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,480
<font color="yellow">You're stronger than you look.</font>

494
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,640
<font color="yellow">I have a crush on someone.</font>

495
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,810
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

496
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,140
<font color="yellow">There's a guy. He's nice.</font>

497
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,040
<font color="yellow">What's the problem, then?</font>

498
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,110
<font color="yellow">He knows me too well.</font>

499
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,840
<font color="yellow">I want someone who knows nothing about me.</font>

500
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,710
<font color="yellow">I'm tired of explaining and making excuses.</font>

501
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,010
<font color="yellow">I had enough of that with Soo Ah.</font>

502
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,440
<font color="yellow">You should look outside the country, then.</font>

503
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,240
<font color="yellow">Knowing too much can never be good.</font>

504
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,370
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

505
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,710
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, can we get two more servings?</font>

506
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,370
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you can finish all that?</font>

507
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,810
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

508
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever get any sleep, Jin Seok?</font>

509
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,610
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep calling me all day?</font>

510
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,010
<font color="yellow">You should've answered, then.</font>

511
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,610
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

512
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,640
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

513
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,640
<font color="yellow">I went to see Soo Ah.</font>

514
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,910
<font color="yellow">What did she say?</font>

515
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,210
<font color="yellow">What does she have to say about us?</font>

516
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,340
<font color="yellow">- Did she get angry?
- She did.</font>

517
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,770
<font color="yellow">She must have been angry at you.</font>

518
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,770
<font color="yellow">She got backstabbed...</font>

519
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,510
<font color="yellow">by someone she trusted.</font>

520
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,340
<font color="yellow">Let's make some things clear.</font>

521
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,370
<font color="yellow">I'm best friends with Soo Ah.</font>

522
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,070
<font color="yellow">You're just some guy I no longer have feelings for.</font>

523
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,240
<font color="yellow">We're just colleagues now.</font>

524
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,370
<font color="yellow">Did I make it clear enough for you?</font>

525
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,510
<font color="yellow">You should go. I need to get some rest, Captain Park.</font>

526
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,370
<font color="yellow">Clear enough, my foot.</font>

527
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,140
<font color="yellow">Did you see Hyo Eun?</font>

528
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,070
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

529
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,170
<font color="yellow">I saw your daughter, Captain.</font>

530
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,980
<font color="yellow">The girl who goes to an international school?</font>

531
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,240
<font color="yellow">- That's...
- I'll check for myself.</font>

532
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,410
<font color="yellow">Suh Doh Woo's wife called me yesterday.</font>

533
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you so shocked?</font>

534
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,510
<font color="yellow">You jumped more than when I asked about the school.</font>

535
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,140
<font color="yellow">I didn't. Why would I?</font>

536
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,140
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- She just called.</font>

537
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,010
<font color="yellow">Suh Doh Woo came over...</font>

538
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,910
<font color="yellow">to my place.</font>

539
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,940
<font color="yellow">He came by?</font>

540
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,810
<font color="yellow">He came to thank me.</font>

541
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,980
<font color="yellow">He came by. In person.</font>

542
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,940
<font color="yellow">The fling between you and I...</font>

543
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,040
<font color="yellow">was actually nothing...</font>

544
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,740
<font color="yellow">compared to this issue.</font>

545
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,910
<font color="yellow">- Jin Seok.
- What I've been imagining for days...</font>

546
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
<font color="yellow">Is it true?</font>

547
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,570
<font color="yellow">How many times...</font>

548
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,010
<font color="yellow">did they thank me?</font>

549
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,840
<font color="yellow">They thanked me because Soo Ah delivered something.</font>

550
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,270
<font color="yellow">And because she bought...</font>

551
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,110
<font color="yellow">the lady patjuk before she died.</font>

552
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,110
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a bit too much?</font>

553
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,010
<font color="yellow">Suh Doh Woo.</font>

554
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,710
<font color="yellow">Suh Doh Woo!</font>

555
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,440
<font color="yellow">Why do I keep hearing the name of a man I don't know?</font>

556
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,870
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

557
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,370
<font color="yellow">Tell me everything.</font>

558
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,740
<font color="yellow">Everything you know.</font>

559
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,140
<font color="yellow">Tell me everything...</font>

560
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,870
<font color="yellow">like you told her about us!</font>

561
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,540
<font color="yellow">Why do you live with Soo Ah?</font>

562
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,610
<font color="yellow">You don't care about her.</font>

563
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,210
<font color="yellow">She's a wife you don't need.</font>

564
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,510
<font color="yellow">You date other women.</font>

565
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,270
<font color="yellow">Soo Ah...</font>

566
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
<font color="yellow">and Hyo Eun are doing well in Jeju Island.</font>

567
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,570
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened until I confirm it did.</font>

568
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,410
<font color="yellow">Unlike someone else,</font>

569
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,640
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't move to an island with my kid...</font>

570
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,440
<font color="yellow">because my husband dated my friend.</font>

571
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,840
<font color="yellow">If only she'd checked,</font>

572
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,040
<font color="yellow">it would've all been a joke.</font>

573
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,570
<font color="yellow">Right. A joke.</font>

574
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,640
<font color="yellow">It's even funnier that we fought about it.</font>

575
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,010
<font color="yellow">I want to erase that past.</font>

576
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,770
<font color="yellow">I already did.</font>

577
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of being stressed about dating the wrong guy.</font>

578
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,910
<font color="yellow">I learned my lesson...</font>

579
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,170
<font color="yellow">and I won't make the same mistake again.</font>

580
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,980
<font color="yellow">You're still making a mistake.</font>

581
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,310
<font color="yellow">Everything you do is a mistake.</font>

00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,770
<font color="yellow">I wonder if someone will visit today.</font>

584
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,770
<font color="yellow">I wish we had visitors every day.</font>

585
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,440
<font color="yellow">So you can stay at home.</font>

586
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,510
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

587
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,370
<font color="yellow">Why did she say that?</font>

588
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,070
<font color="yellow">Could you please check again?</font>

589
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,310
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry but we don't have...</font>

590
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,310
<font color="yellow">a Park Hyo Eun registered at our school.</font>

591
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,370
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

592
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,470
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

593
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,470
<font color="yellow">Did you see me score a goal?</font>

594
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,370
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Wasn't I awesome?</font>

595
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,470
<font color="yellow">Guys, this is my dad.</font>

596
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,140
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

597
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,570
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Dad.</font>

598
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,770
<font color="yellow">Hi. This is my dad.</font>

599
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,770
<font color="yellow">What a wonderful day.</font>

600
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,840
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

601
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,470
<font color="yellow">Park Hyo Eun.</font>

602
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,140
<font color="yellow">I saw with my own eyes that you study here.</font>

603
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,940
<font color="yellow">I don't believe what I don't see myself.</font>

604
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,810
<font color="yellow">Dad, you see...</font>

605
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

606
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,710
<font color="yellow">I begged her to let me stay here.</font>

607
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,610
<font color="yellow">So all this happened because of you?</font>

608
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,570
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

609
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,540
<font color="yellow">it's very bad to lie?</font>

610
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,710
<font color="yellow">Mum said she'd tell you everything.</font>

611
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,940
<font color="yellow">You should've visited a little later.</font>

612
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,770
<font color="yellow">Mum went through so much because of me.</font>

613
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,770
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

614
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:57,770
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun.</font>

615
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,370
<font color="yellow">Dad's so angry that...</font>

616
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,970
<font color="yellow">I don't think I should see your mum.</font>

617
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:03,810
<font color="yellow">We'll only fight.</font>

618
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,640
<font color="yellow">It won't be any fight.</font>

619
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,140
<font color="yellow">It would be scary.</font>

620
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,770
<font color="yellow">Why do that when you'll return to Seoul?</font>

621
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,470
<font color="yellow">Pack up by tomorrow and...</font>

622
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,570
<font color="yellow">By tomorrow?</font>
