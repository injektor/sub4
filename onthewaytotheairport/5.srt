00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,460
<font color="yellow">You asked me to come with you and I didn't.</font>

160
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,690
<font color="yellow">I feel like I broke a promise.</font>

161
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,360
<font color="yellow">It wasn't even a promise.</font>

162
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,160
<font color="yellow">It felt like things were falling apart.</font>

163
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,860
<font color="yellow">I think I'm too old for this.</font>

164
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,160
<font color="yellow">I can't deal with this.</font>

165
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,960
<font color="yellow">I can't deal...</font>

166
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,360
<font color="yellow">with my own emotions.</font>

167
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,160
<font color="yellow">This is wrong. It's not right.</font>

168
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,390
<font color="yellow">Are you done now?</font>

169
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,990
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

170
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,030
<font color="yellow">Don't come any closer.</font>

171
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,360
<font color="yellow">I saw Annie.</font>

172
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,960
<font color="yellow">I saw her after seeing Hyo Eun.</font>

173
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,790
<font color="yellow">She was at the airport.</font>

174
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,390
<font color="yellow">I bumped into this kid...</font>

175
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,830
<font color="yellow">and she dropped a marble.</font>

176
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,030
<font color="yellow">It came rolling towards me.</font>

177
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,090
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stop her in time.</font>

178
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,390
<font color="yellow">She jumped into the crowd and...</font>

179
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,330
<font color="yellow">After I got on the flight,</font>

180
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,960
<font color="yellow">I saw Eun Woo's name on the list.</font>

181
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,760
<font color="yellow">Had I only stopped her in time,</font>

182
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,230
<font color="yellow">I could have saved your daughter.</font>

183
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,690
<font color="yellow">That thought alone made me feel miserable.</font>

184
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,060
<font color="yellow">But it gets worse.</font>

185
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,630
<font color="yellow">When I heard that Annie's not your real daughter,</font>

186
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,560
<font color="yellow">I thought to myself.</font>

187
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,230
<font color="yellow">"Maybe..."</font>

188
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,560
<font color="yellow">"Maybe it's okay to feel less guilty."</font>

189
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,130
<font color="yellow">"Maybe I can tell him..."</font>

190
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,160
<font color="yellow">"that I saw her."</font>

191
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,600
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought to myself.</font>

192
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,960
<font color="yellow">I tried to rationalise myself with Annie's death.</font>

193
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,830
<font color="yellow">That's how we met.</font>

194
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,790
<font color="yellow">I've been trying to talk myself into this,</font>

195
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,760
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

196
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,530
<font color="yellow">it shouldn't be like this.</font>

197
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,490
<font color="yellow">Ever since the beginning,</font>

198
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,860
<font color="yellow">everything was...</font>

199
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,260
<font color="yellow">Your everything was...</font>

200
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,230
<font color="yellow">I can't deal with all of this.</font>

201
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,130
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

202
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,430
<font color="yellow">Watching the sunrise is a lucky sign.</font>

203
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,230
<font color="yellow">Let's go watch it again later. Thanks, Dad.</font>

204
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,890
<font color="yellow">Are you watching...</font>

205
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,030
<font color="yellow">the sunrise?</font>

206
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,790
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

207
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,330
<font color="yellow">You're up early.</font>

208
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,030
<font color="yellow">Come take a seat.</font>

209
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,360
<font color="yellow">25 on language arts,</font>

210
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,330
<font color="yellow">48 on maths...</font>

211
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,060
<font color="yellow">and 77 on English.</font>

212
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,030
<font color="yellow">I've raised two kids in my life.</font>

213
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,630
<font color="yellow">This is the first time I'm seeing scores like these.</font>

214
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,230
<font color="yellow">I can understand how she got low marks...</font>

215
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,390
<font color="yellow">on language arts and maths since she's been abroad.</font>

216
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,360
<font color="yellow">Even then, her English score is too low.</font>

217
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,330
<font color="yellow">Didn't she go to an international school?</font>

218
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

219
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,760
<font color="yellow">I lost sleep over this.</font>

220
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,990
<font color="yellow">Go wash up first. We'll talk more after.</font>

221
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,690
<font color="yellow">I've been working.</font>

222
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,160
<font color="yellow">You do know that we're walking on thin ice,</font>

223
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,990
<font color="yellow">right?</font>

224
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,160
<font color="yellow">I'm not tired at all.</font>

225
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,230
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Please continue.</font>

226
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,430
<font color="yellow">After all, you get a pay cheque every month.</font>

227
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,390
<font color="yellow">That's my wish, to receive a pay cheque every month.</font>

228
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,390
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying, you know?</font>

229
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,390
<font color="yellow">I feel happy for you that you work.</font>

232
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,100
<font color="yellow">You should check her homework, too.</font>

233
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,890
<font color="yellow">I do try my best.</font>

234
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,730
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. What did you say?</font>

235
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,990
<font color="yellow">What did you say your wish was?</font>

236
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,630
<font color="yellow">A monthly salary.</font>

237
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,730
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to you.</font>

238
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,930
<font color="yellow">I'll give you monthly salary for the six months.</font>

239
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,830
<font color="yellow">Give me your account number.</font>

240
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,960
<font color="yellow">I'll wire it.</font>

241
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,390
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

242
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,860
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

243
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,100
<font color="yellow">Let's bring up her grade.</font>

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,290

250
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,790
<font color="yellow">did Eun Woo mention her biological father?</font>

251
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,790
<font color="yellow">I told her that she's good with her hands...</font>

252
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,460
<font color="yellow">and she'd say she took after her dad.</font>

253
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,260
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- The thing is,</font>

254
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,690
<font color="yellow">Doh Woo went to meet her biological father.</font>

255
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,830
<font color="yellow">How did he know where to go?</font>

256
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,860
<font color="yellow">He dropped her off a few times before.</font>

257
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
<font color="yellow">Eun Woo wanted to see him,</font>

258
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,430
<font color="yellow">but Hye Won didn't want her to.</font>

259
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,560
<font color="yellow">- That's why.
- And?</font>

260
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,430
<font color="yellow">He couldn't find her dad.</font>

261
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,160
<font color="yellow">It must've been the wrong place.</font>

262
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,590
<font color="yellow">I doubt that.</font>

263
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,860

- Kim Hye Won.</font>

264
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,030
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

265
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,890
<font color="yellow">I guess you're right.</font>

272
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,390

00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,730
<font color="yellow">I'd rather not.</font>

316
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,160
<font color="yellow">I don't think you'll be very happy.</font>

317
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,890
<font color="yellow">It's something you'd hate.</font>

318
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,330
<font color="yellow">It is a bad timing.</font>

319
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,260
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

320
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,060
<font color="yellow">You know about my dream.</font>

321
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,690
<font color="yellow">It's returning Mongyudowondo to Korea.</font>

322
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,060
<font color="yellow">What I want to do is...</font>

323
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,130
<font color="yellow">to protect old values...</font>

324
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,830
<font color="yellow">and make it more valuable.</font>

325
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,930
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever forget that.</font>

326
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,690
<font color="yellow">One day, you'll understand me.</font>

327
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,360
<font color="yellow">Hye Won.</font>

328
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

329
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,330
<font color="yellow">Keep Hyo Eun's grades away from Mum.</font>

330
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,360
<font color="yellow">Don't just sleep at home.</font>

331
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,830
<font color="yellow">Mum's doing all the chores, isn't she?</font>

332
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,930
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you hide a single test paper?</font>

333
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,860
<font color="yellow">Yes. I will hide it as fast as I can from now on.</font>

340
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,230

345

346
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,660
<font color="yellow">What? Nothing.</font>

347
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,530
<font color="yellow">I came without telling Doh Woo.</font>

348
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,160

- Ms Song.</font>

354

355
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,130
<font color="yellow">You had a visitor.</font>

356
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,860
<font color="yellow">I remember Ms Choi talking about a beer place here.</font>

357
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,090
<font color="yellow">Since when is Sydney famous for beer?</font>

358
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,830
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask her where it was.</font>

359
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,090
<font color="yellow">I don't know. And don't go to such a place.</font>

<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

362
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

363
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,230
<font color="yellow">Were you referring to yourself?</font>

364
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,430
<font color="yellow">I remember you telling me something...</font>

365
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,490
<font color="yellow">while you were drunk.</font>

366
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,890
<font color="yellow">What did I say?</font>

367
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,890
<font color="yellow">You said you met your ex-boyfriend at a beer place.</font>

368
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,730
<font color="yellow">- I didn't.
- You do remember.</font>

369
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,160
<font color="yellow">You were so drunk and told me everything.</font>

370
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,960
<font color="yellow">He lived a third of the year at your house,</font>

371
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,790
<font color="yellow">a third in another country...</font>

372
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,360
<font color="yellow">and the last third...</font>

374
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,590
<font color="yellow">Then he got married to your friend.</font>

375
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,390

378
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,860

384
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,160
<font color="yellow">The day before yesterday,</font>

385
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,430
<font color="yellow">I went to see Annie's father.</font>

386
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,990
<font color="yellow">They said there wasn't anyone like him there.</font>

387
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,030
<font color="yellow">How did you know where he was?</font>

388
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,660
<font color="yellow">How did you know where he was?</font>

389
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,360
<font color="yellow">I gave her a few rides to go see her father.</font>

390
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,560
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

391
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,930
<font color="yellow">Which year? How many times?</font>

392
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,630
<font color="yellow">What more are you not telling me?</font>

393
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I kept it a secret,</font>

394
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,530
<font color="yellow">but she wasn't asking for much.</font>

395
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,760
<font color="yellow">I respected her relationship with her father.</font>

396
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,660
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

397
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,560
<font color="yellow">Why would you give her false hope?</font>

398
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,230
<font color="yellow">How is that giving her false hope?</font>

399
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,260
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

400
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,460
<font color="yellow">really want to know the truth?</font>

401
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,790
<font color="yellow">Annie had no idea where he was.</font>

402
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,630
<font color="yellow">Because he is...</font>

403
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,290
<font color="yellow">already dead.</font>

404
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,530
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

405
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,960
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

406
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,960
<font color="yellow">I tried to hide his death from her.</font>

407
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,730
<font color="yellow">I pretended like he still existed.</font>

408
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,860
<font color="yellow">I know I was on bad terms with him,</font>

409
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,930
<font color="yellow">but I never said a bad thing about him to Annie.</font>

410
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,690
<font color="yellow">I told her he was a good person, a good artist.</font>

411
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,090
<font color="yellow">I told her over and over.</font>

412
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,160
<font color="yellow">Did she not know...</font>

413
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,960
<font color="yellow">that her father was dead?</font>

414
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,830
<font color="yellow">She didn't even know who he was.</font>

415
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,430
<font color="yellow">I told you he left me after Hyo Eun was born.</font>

416
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,860
<font color="yellow">He's not even worth mentioning.</font>

417
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,630
<font color="yellow">If she didn't know,</font>

418
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,690
<font color="yellow">why did she go there?</font>

419
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,160
<font color="yellow">It was her imaginary place.</font>

420
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,160
<font color="yellow">She always imagined his father.</font>

421
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,660
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

422
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,960
<font color="yellow">I told you we weren't together any more.</font>

423
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,430
<font color="yellow">It was simpler that way.</font>

424
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,430
<font color="yellow">If I told you, you would think I still cared about him.</font>

425
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,890
<font color="yellow">I don't care about him.</font>

426
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,460
<font color="yellow">When did he die?</font>

427
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,460
<font color="yellow">Are you questioning me?</font>

428
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,290
<font color="yellow">Annie is my daughter.</font>

429
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,260
<font color="yellow">I want it to be over. Why can't you do the same?</font>

430
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,130
<font color="yellow">Whom are you doing this for?</font>

431
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,360
<font color="yellow">What good comes out of your knowing?</font>

432
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,290
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this for Annie? Or me?</font>

433
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,690
<font color="yellow">Or are you doing this for yourself? Who?</font>

434
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,060
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to be Annie's only dad.</font>

435
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,160
<font color="yellow">That's why I didn't let her talk about her real father.</font>

436
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,290
<font color="yellow">She might not have liked that about me,</font>

437
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,060
<font color="yellow">but I did it because I loved you.</font>

438

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,960
<font color="yellow">I ran away from him...</font>

442
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,490
<font color="yellow">and I want to run away from Annie, too.</font>

443
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,930

00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,460
<font color="yellow">I thought you left.</font>

471
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,630
<font color="yellow">I wanted some coffee.</font>

472
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,790
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the gym. I'll get to work from there.</font>

473
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,460
<font color="yellow">You got a call earlier. Who's calling you at this time?</font>

474
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,390
<font color="yellow">The caller ID said it was someone's mum.</font>

475
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,790
<font color="yellow">I've been in touch with the parents from Malaysia.</font>

476
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,860
<font color="yellow">After hearing about Annie, they've been calling me.</font>

477
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,730
<font color="yellow">It's Annie again.</font>

478
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,160
<font color="yellow">You didn't even notice me when I was an intern.</font>

479
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,590
<font color="yellow">You started taking interest after seeing Annie with me.</font>

480
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,690
<font color="yellow">I guess I'll have to live with it.</font>

481
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,430
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that...</font>

482
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,430
<font color="yellow">I married you because of Annie?</font>

483
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,390
<font color="yellow">Is that what you take me for?</font>

484
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,830
<font color="yellow">I've had my eyes on you for a long time.</font>

485
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,790
<font color="yellow">Your raising her alone was just an extra.</font>

486
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,460
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't marry someone out of sympathy.</font>

487
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,960
<font color="yellow">I know things are hard, but don't question my love.</font>

488
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,760
<font color="yellow">Let's stop. I shouldn't have brought her up again.</font>

489
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,090
<font color="yellow">One last thing.</font>

490
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,260
<font color="yellow">Annie...</font>

491
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
<font color="yellow">had always been grateful to you.</font>

492
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,730
<font color="yellow">She knew that...</font>

493
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,500
<font color="yellow">you gave up your life to raise her.</font>

494
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,590
<font color="yellow">She didn't want to put you in an awkward spot...</font>

495
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,290
<font color="yellow">which is why we kept the secret.</font>

496
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,690
<font color="yellow">So don't feel too offended by that.</font>

497
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,260
<font color="yellow">I think Ji Eun is...</font>

498
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
<font color="yellow">pulling out of the business.</font>

499
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,260
<font color="yellow">I didn't know how to bring this up...</font>

500
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,500
<font color="yellow">and had been thinking on my way here.</font>

501
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,230
<font color="yellow">We have to hang in there. Goodbye.</font>

503
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,090
<font color="yellow">Did you call?</font>

504
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,260
<font color="yellow">Did I disturb you or wake you up?</font>

505
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,230
<font color="yellow">You called a married man in the middle of the night.</font>

506
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,560
<font color="yellow">That's a no-no.</font>

507
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,330
<font color="yellow">That's usually when my wife and I get busy.</font>

508
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,790
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I'll let you continue. Bye.</font>

509
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,060
<font color="yellow">Continue what?</font>

510
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,090
<font color="yellow">I went for a walk last night...</font>

511
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,960
<font color="yellow">and saw kids playing basketball.</font>

512
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,290
<font color="yellow">The ball rolled over and I tossed it.</font>

513
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,160
<font color="yellow">I was way beyond the three-point line.</font>

514
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,030
<font color="yellow">I was 8m away.</font>

515
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
<font color="yellow">I shot...</font>

516
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,260
<font color="yellow">and it went in.</font>

517
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,860
<font color="yellow">That's why I called.</font>

518
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,960
<font color="yellow">Was that wrong?</font>

519
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,890
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

520
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

521
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,030
<font color="yellow">By the river.</font>

522
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,560
<font color="yellow">On my balcony.</font>

523
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,830
<font color="yellow">I can see the river from here.</font>

524
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,390
<font color="yellow">What are you doing there?</font>

525
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,430
<font color="yellow">It's my room.</font>

526
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,960
<font color="yellow">Most wives live here.</font>

527
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,630
<font color="yellow">On the balcony.</font>

528
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,330
<font color="yellow">Can we talk face-to-face? I can come over.</font>

529
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,590
<font color="yellow">Don't. I have to watch Hyo Eun.</font>

530
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
<font color="yellow">The Han River's that way,</font>

531
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
<font color="yellow">so let's say I'm facing you.</font>

532
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,230
<font color="yellow">I want to be serious.</font>

533
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,630
<font color="yellow">I heard your confession after all.</font>

534
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,930
<font color="yellow">It's too much to handle alone.</font>

535
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,000
<font color="yellow">Is it tough?</font>

536
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,930
<font color="yellow">We talk to each other sometimes...</font>

537
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,130
<font color="yellow">and talk about constructive things,</font>

538
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,460
<font color="yellow">and just look at each other.</font>

539
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,930
<font color="yellow">Is that too hard for you?</font>

540
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,930
<font color="yellow">Your existence alone is a great help to me.</font>

541
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,160
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that people could be so comforting.</font>

542
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,430
<font color="yellow">I managed to comfort myself until now.</font>

543
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,430
<font color="yellow">I was arrogant.</font>

544
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,500
<font color="yellow">My mum once said something to me.</font>

545
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,790
<font color="yellow">She said she heard it from her grandmother.</font>

546
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,890
<font color="yellow">Shortly before someone dies,</font>

547
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,000
<font color="yellow">they leave something behind...</font>

548
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,500
<font color="yellow">for someone they care for.</font>

549
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,460
<font color="yellow">Out of longing.</font>

550
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,130
<font color="yellow">They somehow find a way to leave something...</font>

551
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,760
<font color="yellow">they know their loved ones will need.</font>

552
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,890
<font color="yellow">They sense something with their mysterious powers.</font>

553
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,000
<font color="yellow">I felt like Annie was my own...</font>

554
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,690
<font color="yellow">and she liked me, too.</font>

555
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,130
<font color="yellow">When I fall in love with someone,</font>

556
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,790
<font color="yellow">I go all-out.</font>

557
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,590
<font color="yellow">Right before Annie died,</font>

558
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,430
<font color="yellow">she brought us together...</font>

559
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,690
<font color="yellow">with her mysterious powers.</font>

560
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,430
<font color="yellow">How else...</font>

561
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,760
<font color="yellow">could this happen?</font>

562
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,590
<font color="yellow">The emotions that you say are too much for you...</font>

563
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,230
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

564
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,690
<font color="yellow">but I need them desperately.</font>

565
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,230
<font color="yellow">I can't do without them.</font>

566
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,630
<font color="yellow">They're a gift from my daughter.</font>

567
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,360
<font color="yellow">The wind's too strong.</font>

568
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,230
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I'll call...</font>

569
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,860
<font color="yellow">I'll call you again later.</font>

570
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,930
<font color="yellow">The river?</font>

571
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,660
<font color="yellow">The wind?</font>

572
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,530
<font color="yellow">Are you still there?</font>

573
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,730
<font color="yellow">- On the balcony?
- What?</font>

574
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,530
<font color="yellow">On the balcony. Yes.</font>

575
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,690
<font color="yellow">About Annie...</font>

576
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,930
<font color="yellow">Thanks for putting it that way.</font>

577
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,990
<font color="yellow">Do you feel a bit better?</font>

578
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,490
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

579
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,530
<font color="yellow">After I got back...</font>

580
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,890
<font color="yellow">and told you it was too much,</font>

581
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,490
<font color="yellow">I thought it was really over.</font>

582
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,830
<font color="yellow">What is there to end?</font>

583
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,290
<font color="yellow">Can there be...</font>

584
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,830
<font color="yellow">such a relationship?</font>

585
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,260
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is possible...</font>

586
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,460
<font color="yellow">between a married man and a woman?</font>

587
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,260
<font color="yellow">Is this even possible?</font>

588
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,290
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

589
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,990
<font color="yellow">I believed it was impossible.</font>

590
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,290
<font color="yellow">We didn't set out to do this.</font>

591
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,860
<font color="yellow">It happened naturally,</font>

592
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,390
<font color="yellow">and we needed it.</font>

593
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,130
<font color="yellow">Now, we just have to make it possible.</font>

594
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,860
<font color="yellow">But then,</font>

595
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,030
<font color="yellow">it sounds fine in words,</font>

596
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,960
<font color="yellow">but our emotions...</font>

597
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,030
<font color="yellow">I feel guilty.</font>

598
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,430
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure I can say...</font>

599
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,060
<font color="yellow">it's fine or that it's okay.</font>

600
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

601
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,730
<font color="yellow">makes you feel guilty?</font>

602
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,260
<font color="yellow">Looking...</font>

603
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,390
<font color="yellow">and touching.</font>

604
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,660
<font color="yellow">Wanting and waiting.</font>

605
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,790
<font color="yellow">All because I said I'll fly with you.</font>

606
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:55,960
<font color="yellow">Three No's.</font>

607
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,960
<font color="yellow">How about a relationship with Three No's?</font>

608
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,960
<font color="yellow">This will only make sense in a strange relationship.</font>

609
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,490
<font color="yellow">Too much is too bad.</font>

610
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,860
<font color="yellow">We need to lack something.</font>

611
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,830
<font color="yellow">What shall we lack?</font>

612
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,690
<font color="yellow">Wanting,</font>

613
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,030
<font color="yellow">touching...</font>

614
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,460
<font color="yellow">and leaving.</font>

615
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,660
<font color="yellow">Would not having those three...</font>

616
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,890
<font color="yellow">make you feel better?</font>

617
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,230
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

618
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,490
<font color="yellow">There's one more thing.</font>

619
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,760
<font color="yellow">Let's decide...</font>

620
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,830
<font color="yellow">not to define...</font>

621
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,990
<font color="yellow">what our relationship is.</font>

622
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,560
<font color="yellow">We're not sure and let's leave it at that.</font>

623
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,860
<font color="yellow">"I like you", "I love you",</font>

624
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,030
<font color="yellow">"I hate you". We'll say none of that.</font>

625
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,330
<font color="yellow">Even if we feel something,</font>

698
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,390
<font color="yellow">She divorced as soon as Eun Woo was born...</font>

699
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,860
<font color="yellow">and raised her alone amid much hardships.</font>

700
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,590
<font color="yellow">Eun Woo's father died a few years ago.</font>

701
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,860
<font color="yellow">According to Hye Won.</font>

702
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,390
<font color="yellow">That's all true,</font>

703
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:33,590
<font color="yellow">but Eun Woo got a gift from her dad when she was seven,</font>

704
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,160
<font color="yellow">they exchanged letters, Eun Woo found out...</font>

705
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,860
<font color="yellow">where he works and you took her there a few times.</font>

706
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,960
<font color="yellow">That's according to Eun Woo.</font>

707
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,390
<font color="yellow">Which is correct?</font>

708
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,360
<font color="yellow">Either Annie lied about...</font>

709
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,960
<font color="yellow">a dad who didn't exist...</font>

710
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,490

<font color="yellow">Or neither of them lied.</font>

713
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,260
<font color="yellow">Eun Woo really planned to meet her dad there...</font>

714
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:15,060
<font color="yellow">and he really did die a few years ago.</font>

715
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,760
<font color="yellow">Eun Woo really did not know about that,</font>

716
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,760
<font color="yellow">but they'd promised to...</font>

717
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,990

718
