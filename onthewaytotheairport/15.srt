00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,980
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about that, too.</font>

315
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,610
<font color="yellow">It's hard to choose.</font>

316
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,950
<font color="yellow">Once you grow older,</font>

317
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,810
<font color="yellow">you'll have to choose a certain shampoo you like.</font>

318
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,080
<font color="yellow">You have to choose many things...</font>

319
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,150
<font color="yellow">like clothes, work and people.</font>

320
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,580
<font color="yellow">Make sure you keep your standards.</font>

321
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,710
<font color="yellow">The centre needs to be you.</font>

322
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,050
<font color="yellow">Not others.</font>

323
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,950
<font color="yellow">I should be selfish, then.</font>

324
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,310
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

325
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,510
<font color="yellow">a little different.</font>

326
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,150
<font color="yellow">There is probably something that you are drawn to.</font>

327
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,210
<font color="yellow">Close your eyes...</font>

328
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,380
<font color="yellow">and imagine New Zealand, Seoul and Jeju Island.</font>

329
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,880
<font color="yellow">Imagine them in your head.</font>

330
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,580
<font color="yellow">Then your heart...</font>

331
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,880
<font color="yellow">will lead you.</font>

332
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,450
<font color="yellow">You'll be drawn to one.</font>

333
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,110
<font color="yellow">Make sure you stay focused and find out.</font>

334
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,410
<font color="yellow">If you ignore that desire, you'll ignore it for life.</font>

335
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,210
<font color="yellow">I'd feel bad if it gets ignored.</font>

336
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,980
<font color="yellow">Right? If you start ignoring that once,</font>

337
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,110
<font color="yellow">it'll hurt...</font>

338
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,910
<font color="yellow">right here.</font>

339
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,910
<font color="yellow">But what if I regret later?</font>

340
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,250
<font color="yellow">You'll figure it out then.</font>

341
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,510
<font color="yellow">Everything has its ups and downs.</font>

342
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,380
<font color="yellow">For now, focus on choosing.</font>

343
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,580
<font color="yellow">Let's practise this starting now.</font>

344
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,250
<font color="yellow">You'll know where you want to go.</font>

345
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,150
<font color="yellow">If I choose something,</font>

346
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,950
<font color="yellow">will you respect my choice?</font>

347
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,550
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

348
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,980
<font color="yellow">Let's all get along well.</font>

349
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,950
<font color="yellow">- Yes. Be good friends.
- Yes.</font>

350
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,280
<font color="yellow">You two should do a handshake.</font>

351
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,850
<font color="yellow">You all are here.</font>

352
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,480
<font color="yellow">We were about to leave.</font>

353
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,250
<font color="yellow">No, don't worry about it.</font>

354
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,350
<font color="yellow">May I join you?</font>

355
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,450
<font color="yellow">You're all here.</font>

356
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,750
<font color="yellow">Mi Jin.</font>

357
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
<font color="yellow">You can join us.</font>

358
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,180
<font color="yellow">Is that okay?</font>

359
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,180
<font color="yellow">That can happen.</font>

360
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,610
<font color="yellow">You don't see each other every day.</font>

361
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,810
<font color="yellow">You two probably get along better.</font>

362
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,850
<font color="yellow">That's the key. That's the best thing about this job.</font>

363
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,150
<font color="yellow">I want a wife who just takes care of me.</font>

364
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,810
<font color="yellow">When I go home, I want her to be waiting.</font>

365
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,880
<font color="yellow">I tend to fly around a lot,</font>

366
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,550
<font color="yellow">so I want someone with a more stable job.</font>

367
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,680
<font color="yellow">This guy has a long way to go.</font>

368
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,150
<font color="yellow">When she goes absent all of a sudden,</font>

369
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,780
<font color="yellow">you'll get suspicious.</font>

370
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,250
<font color="yellow">But things like that don't happen to us.</font>

371
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,710
<font color="yellow">We only share 51 percent.</font>

372
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,910
<font color="yellow">There's a little bit of trust...</font>

373
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,350
<font color="yellow">and a little bit of approval of freedom.</font>

374
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,680
<font color="yellow">So if Soo Ah were to seek some freedom...</font>

375
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,950
<font color="yellow">I'd allow it.</font>

376
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,010
<font color="yellow">Some fooling around actually keeps you going in life.</font>

377
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,850
<font color="yellow">You're awfully generous.</font>

378
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,750
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

379
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,510
<font color="yellow">I'll kill them all.</font>

380
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,710
<font color="yellow">I'll kill them all.</font>

381
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,550
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

382
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:30,574

383
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,780
<font color="yellow">Soo Ah.</font>

384
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,980
<font color="yellow">What are you lost in thought for?</font>

385
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,750
<font color="yellow">Sometimes,</font>

386
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,050
<font color="yellow">people tell you to think only about yourself.</font>

387
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,010
<font color="yellow">Can you do that?</font>

388
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,180
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

389
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
<font color="yellow">The oldest kid here.</font>

390
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,950
<font color="yellow">The second oldest here and the third one there.</font>

391
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,510
<font color="yellow">And this place is for my husband and his family.</font>

392
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,180
<font color="yellow">When I used to weigh 48kg,</font>

393
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,450
<font color="yellow">that's when I only thought about myself.</font>

394
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,110
<font color="yellow">"What should I wear? What should I eat?"</font>

395
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,480
<font color="yellow">It was all about me.</font>

396
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,950
<font color="yellow">Telling me to think only about myself...</font>

397
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,180
<font color="yellow">is like telling the 48kg me to live my life...</font>

398
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,250
<font color="yellow">taking care of everyone around me.</font>

399
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,180
<font color="yellow">It'll be even harder than that.</font>

400
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,950
<font color="yellow">My weight isn't the only thing I miss from those days.</font>

401
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,580
<font color="yellow">I laughed and cried for myself.</font>

402
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,550
<font color="yellow">All I had to care about was my emotions.</font>

403
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,210
<font color="yellow">How light is that?</font>

404
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,210
<font color="yellow">I miss that.</font>

405
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,180
<font color="yellow">But life is strange.</font>

406
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,950
<font color="yellow">Things go back to how they used to be.</font>

407
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,410
<font color="yellow">When my children grow up,</font>

408
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,480
<font color="yellow">the heavy weight will be lifted...</font>

409
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,250
<font color="yellow">and I'll be that much lonelier.</font>

410
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,880
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

411
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,320
<font color="yellow">I'm close to home.</font>

412
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,750
<font color="yellow">You're by the sea, aren't you?</font>

413
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

414
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,380
<font color="yellow">I miss that.</font>

415
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,880
<font color="yellow">You should come.</font>

416
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,320
<font color="yellow">We can't always go back to what we miss.</font>

417
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,380
<font color="yellow">Should I go instead?</font>

418
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,850
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

419
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,850
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

420
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,680
<font color="yellow">"Where are you?" "I'll be back soon."</font>

421
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,350
<font color="yellow">"When are you coming back?" "I'll be back soon."</font>

422
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,780
<font color="yellow">You always say that.</font>

423
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,350
<font color="yellow">Something came up.</font>

424
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,450
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun is trying to choose...</font>

425
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,480
<font color="yellow">between her Aunt's place and Jeju Island.</font>

426
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,250
<font color="yellow">At first, she was going to her Aunt in New Zealand,</font>

427
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,450
<font color="yellow">but we changed our minds and sent her to Malaysia.</font>

428
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,410
<font color="yellow">So that's why you were in a rush to find a homestay?</font>

429
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,280
<font color="yellow">And that's why...</font>

430
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,210
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

431
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,250
<font color="yellow">That's where the story began.</font>

432
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,080
<font color="yellow">Doh Woo, do you remember my telling you about...</font>

433
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,980
<font color="yellow">how I used to live in Jeju Island when I was young?</font>

434
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,980
<font color="yellow">All I had was my family as a stranger to the new city.</font>

435
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,850
<font color="yellow">I said I'd wait for my mum and dad...</font>

436
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,350
<font color="yellow">on a field with nothing but telephone poles.</font>

437
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,180
<font color="yellow">I can't remember very clearly,</font>

438
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,510
<font color="yellow">but your neighbourhood reminds me of that.</font>

439
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,710
<font color="yellow">Your house is in the background.</font>

440
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,910
<font color="yellow">My brother, my parents and myself.</font>

441
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,650
<font color="yellow">We're all playing together there.</font>

442
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,010
<font color="yellow">It's strange.</font>

443
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,550
<font color="yellow">I felt happiness and warmth...</font>

444
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,210
<font color="yellow">just by being with my family.</font>

445
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,610
<font color="yellow">I miss having a family like that.</font>

446
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,280
<font color="yellow">If you miss something,</font>

447
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,450
<font color="yellow">go back for it.</font>

448
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,880
<font color="yellow">Touch it. Run for it.</font>

449
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,010
<font color="yellow">We should live like that.</font>

450
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,350
<font color="yellow">You have to go.</font>

451
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,150
<font color="yellow">I'm not giving you any allowance then.</font>

452
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,280
<font color="yellow">Study hard, okay?</font>

453
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,010
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- That's a good girl.</font>

454
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,580
<font color="yellow">Hey, Soo Ah.</font>

455
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,910
<font color="yellow">Long time no see, Jin Sook.</font>

456
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,980
<font color="yellow">How are your legs?</font>

457
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,510
<font color="yellow">I'm feeling all better with Mum here.</font>

458
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,080
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

459
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,850
<font color="yellow">I have the utmost respect for you...</font>

460
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,580
<font color="yellow">for putting up with Jin Seok.</font>

461
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,320
<font color="yellow">Aren't you sick of him?</font>

462
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,010
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

463
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,380
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun. There are football fields everywhere.</font>

464
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,180
<font color="yellow">The first thing I checked out were the football fields.</font>

465
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,480
<font color="yellow">It's everywhere.</font>

466
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:59,550
<font color="yellow">Why are you hesitating when your dad will work here?</font>

467
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,950
<font color="yellow">What? Jin Seok's going to work there?</font>

468
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,380
<font color="yellow">Didn't he tell you?</font>

469
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,610
<font color="yellow">He got assigned to Auckland...</font>

470
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,950
<font color="yellow">despite all the competition.</font>

471
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,050
<font color="yellow">He'll be working abroad.</font>

472
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,010
<font color="yellow">He says he'll be living here.</font>

473
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,480
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun. Soo Ah.</font>

474
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,820
<font color="yellow">Come join us...</font>

475
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,750
<font color="yellow">and enjoy this luxurious life.</font>

476
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,210
<font color="yellow">Okay, Grandma.</font>

477
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,550
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty.</font>

478
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,910
<font color="yellow">All your friends in Jeju Island...</font>

479
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,680
<font color="yellow">are going camping together for the winter break.</font>

480
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,980
<font color="yellow">You've always wanted to go camping in the winter.</font>

481
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,450
<font color="yellow">Here is the text message.</font>

482
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,710
<font color="yellow">Mum, I want to go to New Zealand.</font>

483
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,980
<font color="yellow">That's where my heart directs me to.</font>

484
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,080
<font color="yellow">Dad will be working there...</font>

485
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,610
<font color="yellow">and you'll be a stay at home mum.</font>

486
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,750
<font color="yellow">The whole family will be under the same roof.</font>

487
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,880
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

488
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,180
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

489
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,280
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

490
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,710
<font color="yellow">Right. I respect your decision.</font>

491
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,250
<font color="yellow">But can you give it another thought?</font>

492
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,320
<font color="yellow">We left things behind in Jeju Island.</font>

493
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,180
<font color="yellow">I gave it a lot of thought. I want to go there.</font>

494
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,080
<font color="yellow">I'll give Dad the good news.</font>

495
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,450
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

496
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,050
<font color="yellow">So far, I'm only getting a couple of visitors a day.</font>

497
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,710
<font color="yellow">You'll be closing soon.</font>

498
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,450
<font color="yellow">You're leaving in the afternoon? Change in schedule?</font>

499
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,180
<font color="yellow">It's just that I finally have some free time.</font>

500
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,320
<font color="yellow">I want to go on a trip before I start studying.</font>

501
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,080
<font color="yellow">What time do you need to arrive at the airport?</font>

502
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,150
<font color="yellow">5:30pm.</font>

503
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,410
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Hyun Woo to pick you up.</font>

504
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,380
<font color="yellow">Get something to eat before you leave.</font>

505
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,180
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

506
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,850
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

507
00:41:26,874 --> 00:41:38,874
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

508
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,050
<font color="yellow">Some man brought this with him for you.</font>

509
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,250
<font color="yellow">Go around twice and...</font>

510
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,080
<font color="yellow">Oh no. It unravelled.</font>

511
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,380
<font color="yellow">Try again from the start.</font>

512
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,580
<font color="yellow">First, I do this...</font>

513
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,450
<font color="yellow">Like this...</font>

514
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,750
<font color="yellow">The music.</font>

515
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,880
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

516
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,710
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Doh Woo only just called.</font>

517
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,280
<font color="yellow">That's why it's so shabby.</font>

518
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,750
<font color="yellow">I'm usually great at throwing parties.</font>

519
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,510
<font color="yellow">Oh my. If we threw her a decent farewell party,</font>

520
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,380
<font color="yellow">it might have overwhelmed her.</font>

521
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,880
<font color="yellow">Then she'd miss her flight.</font>

522
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,780
<font color="yellow">(CAPTAIN PARK)</font>

523
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,810
<font color="yellow">Number one, I sent the plane tickets to your email.</font>

524
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,650
<font color="yellow">Board the flight with Hyo Eun.</font>

525
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,210
<font color="yellow">Number two, Jae Ah and I will...</font>

526
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,150
<font color="yellow">sort out the house in Seoul.</font>

527
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,250
<font color="yellow">The master bedroom.</font>

528
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,150
<font color="yellow">Check the living room.</font>

529
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,450
<font color="yellow">The house is nice and clean.</font>

530
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,910
<font color="yellow">They're moving abroad...</font>

531
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,380
<font color="yellow">and are in a hurry.</font>

532
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,550
<font color="yellow">It's hard to find a house like this.</font>

533
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,980
<font color="yellow">Can I see the child's room?</font>

534
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,210
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- It's this way.</font>

535
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,610
<font color="yellow">It's spring over there, so I'll take my spring clothes.</font>

536
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,980
<font color="yellow">Let's ask Dad to send us the rest.</font>

537
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,980
<font color="yellow">Isn't this all a bit like how we rushed to Malaysia?</font>

538
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,080
<font color="yellow">We left in a hurry and when we got back,</font>

539
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,250
<font color="yellow">all our things had been moved to this apartment.</font>

540
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,010
<font color="yellow">You don't have to rush to make a decision.</font>

541
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,450
<font color="yellow">I thought about it a lot...</font>

542
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,710
<font color="yellow">and I want to go quickly.</font>

543
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,610
<font color="yellow">I want to start school, too.</font>

544
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,650
<font color="yellow">This time, I'll be good and stay for a long time.</font>

545
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,750
<font color="yellow">Hi, Soo Ah.</font>

546
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,780
<font color="yellow">I can't talk to my husband.</font>

547
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,210
<font color="yellow">He won't let me talk.</font>

548
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,110
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

549
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,180
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired.</font>

550
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,580
<font color="yellow">- This is hard work.
- Take some multi-vitamins.</font>

551
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,480
<font color="yellow">- It gets harder.
- Doesn't it?</font>

552
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
<font color="yellow">It's natural.</font>

553
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,750
<font color="yellow">Joo Hyun.</font>

554
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,950
<font color="yellow">What did that guy say?</font>

555
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,080
<font color="yellow">Don't ask.</font>

556
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,080
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

557
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,480
<font color="yellow">Captain Park.</font>

558
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,950
<font color="yellow">Captain Park.</font>

559
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,850
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

560
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,480
<font color="yellow">It's an emergency. Something happened to your family.</font>

561
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,650
<font color="yellow">I'll call right back.</font>

562
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,350
<font color="yellow">Go on inside.</font>

563
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,480
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Goodnight.</font>

564
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

565
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,650
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight.
- Sleep well.</font>

566
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,880
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.</font>

567
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,710
<font color="yellow">The line is busy. Please leave a message after...</font>

568
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,210
<font color="yellow">She got through, then.</font>

569
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,210
<font color="yellow">Don't thank, apologise or ask for forgiveness.</font>

570
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,180
<font color="yellow">I know this isn't something to say over the phone,</font>

571
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,680
<font color="yellow">but I can't go with Hyo Eun.</font>

572
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,880
<font color="yellow">I can't leave before we chat.</font>

573
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,880
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

574
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,780
<font color="yellow">Will you send Hyo Eun alone?</font>

575
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,750
<font color="yellow">That's why we need to talk.</font>

576
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,580
<font color="yellow">- Talk.
- The thing is...</font>

577
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,850
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm so kind?</font>

578
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,050
<font color="yellow">I'm trying.</font>

579
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,810
<font color="yellow">To be nice.</font>

580
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,950
<font color="yellow">I sent a manual to make this work.</font>

581
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,180
<font color="yellow">I could have chewed you out...</font>

582
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,680
<font color="yellow">or done way worse than slam a rock on the dining table,</font>

583
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,710
<font color="yellow">but I won't. Why?</font>

584
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,580
<font color="yellow">Because we're family.</font>

585
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,910
<font color="yellow">"Family"?</font>

586
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're family.</font>

587
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,580
<font color="yellow">After I had Hyo Eun,</font>

588
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,310
<font color="yellow">we were almost never together.</font>

589
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,050
<font color="yellow">Deliberate or not,</font>

590
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,680
<font color="yellow">we took alternating shifts.</font>

591
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,880
<font color="yellow">I asked myself something.</font>

592
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,050
<font color="yellow">"Are you okay, Soo Ah?"</font>

593
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,250
<font color="yellow">"Is this what you think a family should be like?"</font>

594
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,650
<font color="yellow">"Is this okay?"</font>

595
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,650
<font color="yellow">"Yes, it's okay."</font>

596
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,050
<font color="yellow">"It will be okay."</font>

597
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,450
<font color="yellow">I thought it had to be overcome.</font>

598
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,680
<font color="yellow">I never considered it as a matter of choice.</font>

599
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,910
<font color="yellow">- But...
- You will choose?</font>

600
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

601
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,610
<font color="yellow">It's something to overcome.</font>

602
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,610
<font color="yellow">We're facing a crisis that any couple face.</font>

603
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,380
<font color="yellow">You should apologise before asking for counselling.</font>

604
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,350
<font color="yellow">You should kneel and beg first!</font>

605
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,580
<font color="yellow">I'll beg. I'll do anything.</font>

606
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,710
<font color="yellow">That's why we need to meet.</font>

607
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,480
<font color="yellow">No. You don't need to beg.</font>

608
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,850
<font color="yellow">You left Hyo Eun alone for a short while.</font>

609
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,050
<font color="yellow">You don't need to beg for that.</font>

610
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,080
<font color="yellow">Go to New Zealand with Hyo Eun.</font>

611
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,550
<font color="yellow">Go...</font>

612
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,310
<font color="yellow">and we'll talk there.</font>

613
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:31,150
<font color="yellow">Nature and family is all we'll have there.</font>

614
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,150
<font color="yellow">We'll have plenty of time.</font>

615
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,480
<font color="yellow">I will make you go to New Zealand.</font>

616
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,810
<font color="yellow">The real pain...</font>

617
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:00,380
<font color="yellow">will begin then.</font>

618
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,280
<font color="yellow">It reminds me of when we packed for Malaysia.</font>

619
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,480
<font color="yellow">Hyo Eun.</font>

620
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,580
<font color="yellow">Sit over here. I have something to say.</font>

621
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,550
<font color="yellow">I haven't made up my mind yet.</font>

622
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:33,850

<font color="yellow">I'll talk to your dad first...</font>

624
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,610
<font color="yellow">and then decide.</font>

625
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,710
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

626
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:42,910

631
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,710

633

<font color="yellow">is beside you.</font>

634
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,280
<font color="yellow">I really don't want to be away from you but...</font>

635
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,010
<font color="yellow">Being beside you,</font>

636
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,850
<font color="yellow">can I do that while we're apart?</font>

637
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,610
<font color="yellow">It's hard to explain.</font>

638
