<font color="yellow">What I'm going to do now?</font>

8
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,200
<font color="yellow">You just have to look for her.</font>

9
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,600
<font color="yellow">Me too. I will just look for you.</font>

10
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,400
<font color="yellow">I like that.</font>

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,400
<font color="yellow">To have a friend like that.</font>

12
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,270
<font color="yellow">Leave it.</font>

13
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,220
<font color="yellow">Why couldn't I say it?</font>

14
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,120
<font color="yellow">I knew she wanted so badly to hear it.</font>

15
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,180
<font color="yellow">I couldn't tell her I loved her.</font>

16
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,870
<font color="yellow">I did not think I did.</font>

17
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,240
<font color="yellow">But, Soo...</font>

18
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,940
<font color="yellow">those feelings were love.</font>

19
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,140
<font color="yellow">I thought I was just grateful.</font>

20
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,490
<font color="yellow">It was love.</font>

21
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,090
<font color="yellow">I thought she was just comforting.</font>

22
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,660
<font color="yellow">It was love.</font>

23
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,500
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

24
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,200
<font color="yellow">What should I do now?</font>

25
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,450
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

26
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,260
<font color="yellow">What can I do now, Soo?</font>

27
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,810
<font color="yellow">I should have told her.</font>

28
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
<font color="yellow">She had waited so long.</font>

29
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,290
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Myung Hee already knew.</font>

30
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,020
<font color="yellow">She already knew.</font>

31
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,480
<font color="yellow">You can stop now.</font>

32
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,130
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

33
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,880
<font color="yellow">Why now?</font>

34
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,310
<font color="yellow">Why now?</font>

35
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,540
<font color="yellow">I received all of her love.</font>

36
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,550
<font color="yellow">Why? Why, why, why, why?</font>

37
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,540
<font color="yellow">Why did I just realize now?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>What will happen now?</i></font>

39
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,450

40
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,170
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't think of anything.</i></font>

41
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,260
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

42
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,760
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

43
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,010
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Those men with
no clothes on are the princes.</font>

44
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,670
<font color="yellow">You indecent girl.</font>

45
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,100
<font color="yellow">You need to get into trouble.</font>

46
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,110
<font color="yellow">What is that? Are you making fun of me?</font>

47
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,900
<font color="yellow">Aren't you a prince?</font>

48
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,600
<font color="yellow">You need to get a beating.</font>

49
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
<font color="yellow">Hey! Let go.</font>

50
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,780
<font color="yellow">You let go first!</font>

51
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,980
<font color="yellow">How impudent!</font>

52
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,320
<font color="yellow">Impudent, yeah right!</font>

53
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,970
<font color="yellow">How dare you speak that way to a prince?</font>

54
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,600
<font color="yellow">Prince, yeah right!</font>

55
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,940
<font color="yellow">You dare to hit a girl?</font>

56
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,350
<font color="yellow">You're as tiny as a grain of rice.</font>

57
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,270
<font color="yellow">Ouch, ouch!</font>

58
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,170
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

59
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,800
<font color="yellow">Where did you get the idea
to do a puppet show?</font>

60
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,320
<font color="yellow">I'm a little bit touched.</font>

61
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,040
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, you're awesome.</font>

62
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,840
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved to hear you enjoyed it.</font>

63
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,260
<font color="yellow">I thought you might be feeling down
since my sister-in-law's death.</font>

64
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,930
<font color="yellow">By the way, what is this?</font>

65
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,320
<font color="yellow">Awesome... the best.</font>

66
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,410
<font color="yellow">The thumb is the head
of the five fingers.</font>

67
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,730
<font color="yellow">That's not right!</font>

68
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,320
<font color="yellow">There is the mighty king,
so how could that be me?</font>

69
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,360
<font color="yellow">Maybe if it's this one.</font>

70
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,910
<font color="yellow">This one is good too.</font>

71
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,680
<font color="yellow">10th Prince, you were
really awesome today.</font>

72
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,850
<font color="yellow">I was able to laugh thanks to you.</font>

73
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,260
<font color="yellow">It's too bad I'm the only
awesome person in your life.</font>

74
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,840
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, you were the best today.</font>

75
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,290
<font color="yellow">I was, wasn't I?</font>

76
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,850
<font color="yellow">- That's enough, now.
- Your Highness, you're so funny.</font>

77
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,760
<font color="yellow">- Am I really?
- Stop that.</font>

78
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,820
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, you're the best looking.</font>

79
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,580
<font color="yellow">- Oh, am I?
- I said stop already.</font>

80
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,480
<font color="yellow">- Who do you like most?
- Prince Eun, of course!</font>

81
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,840
<font color="yellow">I said stop.</font>

82
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,310
<font color="yellow"><i>Time goes by so fast.</i></font>

83
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,690
<font color="yellow"><i>I suppose I've been here a long time too.</i></font>

84
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,290
<font color="yellow"><i>At first, I wondered if
I could even live here.</i></font>

85
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,700
<font color="yellow"><i>It wasn't so bad here.</i></font>

86
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,200
<font color="yellow"><i>But...</i></font>

87
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,320
<font color="yellow"><i>how long will I have
to live here as Hae Soo?</i></font>

88
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,740
<font color="yellow"><i>I wanted to tell you all of this
many times, Myung Hee.</i></font>

89
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,520
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry about everything.</i></font>

90
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,580
<font color="yellow"><i>And thank you.</i></font>

91
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,290
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo!</font>

92
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,530
<font color="yellow">Sis! Hae Soo!</font>

93
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,320
<font color="yellow">You're going to trip and fall.</font>

94
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,850
<font color="yellow">Go get it!</font>

95
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,550
<font color="yellow">Go get it...</font>

96
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,570
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hwa.</font>

97
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,790
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hwa.</font>

98
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,380
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

99
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,140
<font color="yellow">Where are you all coming from?</font>

100
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,280
<font color="yellow">We went to visit our sister-in-law.</font>

101
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,930
<font color="yellow">She must have been happy.</font>

102
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,920
<font color="yellow">If I had told you earlier,
you could have told Myung Hee yourself.</font>

103
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,170
<font color="yellow">I have good news for you.</font>

104
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,430
<font color="yellow">You will be getting married.</font>

105
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,940
<font color="yellow">Married?</font>

106
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,220
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

107
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,010
<font color="yellow">You plan on marrying Soo off?</font>

108
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,490
<font color="yellow">Ah, I see. It's just so sudden.</font>

109
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,300
<font color="yellow">She's at the marrying age.
We can't just leave her be.</font>

110
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,600
<font color="yellow">Thankfully we've found a
great person for her to marry.</font>

111
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,480
<font color="yellow">For Soo, a marriage like this
will be hard to come by again.</font>

112
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,970
<font color="yellow">Still, Lady Hae just passed away.</font>

113
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,810
<font color="yellow">What do you mean marriage?</font>

114
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,970
<font color="yellow">You should give her some space.</font>

115
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,930
<font color="yellow">It is actually a good thing.</font>

116
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,680
<font color="yellow">If she remains too long
where Myung Hee died</font>

117
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,430
<font color="yellow">it won't bode well for her
future marriage opportunities.</font>

118
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,050
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, we hope you understand.</font>

119
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,070
<font color="yellow">We cannot lose out on this opportunity.</font>

120
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,060
<font color="yellow">Marriage? Is there anything so shocking?</font>

121
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,320
<font color="yellow">It is true that she's
at the marrying age.</font>

122
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,940
<font color="yellow">You're here now, so you
might as well oppose the marriage.</font>

123
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,130
<font color="yellow">It's a Hae household affair.</font>

124
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,760
<font color="yellow">We have no right to do that.</font>

125
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,050
<font color="yellow">So! So, So.</font>

126
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,390
<font color="yellow">Is it true that Hae Soo
is getting married?</font>

127
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,670
<font color="yellow">Baek Ah, did you hear?</font>

128
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,160
<font color="yellow">Eun heard somewhere.</font>

129
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,550
<font color="yellow">The man she's marrying is an old man
who is over 60 with many, many sons.</font>

130
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,110
<font color="yellow">Oh, that dummy.
Does she know what she's getting into?</font>

131
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,280
<font color="yellow">If that is true, this is no marriage.
She's basically being sold.</font>

132
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, she is being sold.</font>

133
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,110
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

134
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,620
<font color="yellow">Say it again.</font>

135
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,770
<font color="yellow">What kind of home is Soo going to?</font>

136
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,340
<font color="yellow">Wook, you're too much.</font>

137
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,990
<font color="yellow">How could you treat Soo this way?</font>

138
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,650
<font color="yellow">The man she's marrying made the offer</font>

139
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,540
<font color="yellow">to make up for the
mistreatment of the Haes.</font>

140
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,200
<font color="yellow">Selling Soo away like this
is dishonorable.</font>

141
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,880
<font color="yellow">I need you all to help me.</font>

142
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,350
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung. I want to leave.</font>

143
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,470
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

144
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,030
<font color="yellow">How can I live with a man I've never met?</font>

145
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,920
<font color="yellow">Myung Hee would never have
wanted me to marry in this way.</font>

146
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,010
<font color="yellow">Give me that. I have to run.</font>

147
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,420
<font color="yellow">Hurry, hurry.</font>

148
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,560
<font color="yellow">Yes, go! Please go.</font>

149
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,580
<font color="yellow">Even if I get beaten to death,
I won't tell them where you went, Lady.</font>

150
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,620
<font color="yellow">Chae Ryung.</font>

151
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,020
<font color="yellow">Soo! Hurry up and come out.</font>

152
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,680
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

153
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,920
<font color="yellow">Will this be okay?</font>

154
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,550
<font color="yellow">I can't send you away like this.</font>

155
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,830
<font color="yellow">That was what he said.</font>

156
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,850
<font color="yellow">Wook?</font>

157
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,380
<font color="yellow">Follow them!</font>

158
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,170
<font color="yellow">- Stop!
- Stop!</font>

159
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,020
<font color="yellow">Stop, Wook.</font>

160
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,360
<font color="yellow">You impudent thing.</font>

161
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,250
<font color="yellow">You dare to stand
in the path of a prince!</font>

162
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,180
<font color="yellow">- Wook.
- Oh, Yeon Hwa.</font>

163
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,350
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Has something happened at home?</font>

164
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,890
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

165
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,960
<font color="yellow">I believe that my niece has become
a burden to you, Your Highness.</font>

166
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,400
<font color="yellow">Peek-a-boo!</font>

167
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,930
<font color="yellow">Your niece was my brother?</font>

168
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,430
<font color="yellow">Search the other paths. Now!</font>

169
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,910
<font color="yellow"><i>I didn't think you would
help me too, Prince So.</i></font>

170
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,940
<font color="yellow"><i>I just don't want to see you
live a life controlled by others.</i></font>

171
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,980
<font color="yellow"><i>It's really not worth living like that.</i></font>

172
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,570
<font color="yellow">Hello to you, Your Highnesses.</font>

173
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,960
<font color="yellow">What brings you out here,
and with the royal guards, at that?</font>

174
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,000
<font color="yellow">Is that not Lady Soo from
the 8th Prince's home?</font>

175
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,490
<font color="yellow">You will need to come with me.</font>

176
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,720
<font color="yellow">Why do you need her?</font>

177
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,980
<font color="yellow">Did the person who is to marry her
ask you for a favor?</font>

178
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,310
<font color="yellow">Ji Mong.</font>

179
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,730
<font color="yellow">Look the other way just this once.</font>

180
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,630
<font color="yellow">How could she marry into
a household like that?</font>

181
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,940
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel bad for her?</font>

182
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,640
<font color="yellow">An order has been given for
Lady Soo to enter the palace.</font>

183
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,770
<font color="yellow">What do you mean "enter the palace"?</font>

184
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,910
<font color="yellow">It's not possible.</font>

185
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,750
<font color="yellow">It has been confirmed that
the king will marry Lady Soo.</font>

186
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,200
<font color="yellow">I have come to take her.</font>

187
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,220
<font color="yellow">You must be mistaken.</font>

188
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,130
<font color="yellow">It was sudden.</font>

189
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,180
<font color="yellow">The daughter of the Hong Ha Jin Hae clan
and In Gyu Go Myung, Lady Soo</font>

190
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,100
<font color="yellow">is definitely to be married to the king.</font>

191
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,550
<font color="yellow">Have you heard anything?</font>

192
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,230
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

193
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,350
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense. Why would I...</font>

194
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,040
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Don't get off and wait.</font>

195
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,850
<font color="yellow">4th Prince.</font>

196
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,050
<font color="yellow">Astronomer Ji Mong.</font>

197
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,310
<font color="yellow">Astronomer!</font>

198
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
<font color="yellow">Your Highness.</font>

199
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,300
<font color="yellow">What happened? Marriage to the king?</font>

200
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,670
<font color="yellow">Oh, you heard about it.</font>

201
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,630
<font color="yellow">The king has acknowledged
the Hae household's efforts.</font>

202
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,330
<font color="yellow">He would like for us to be in-laws.</font>

203
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,770
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me
Soo was to marry the king?</font>

204
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,320
<font color="yellow">Myung Hee is dead now.</font>

205
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,940
<font color="yellow">We are no longer related to you.</font>

206
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,230
<font color="yellow">Suppose Soo were to get pregnant
with the king's child.</font>

207
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,400
<font color="yellow">You may have a breakdown in
relations due to the throne.</font>

208
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,000
<font color="yellow">Were you afraid we would stop
the marriage if we knew about it?</font>

209
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,190
<font color="yellow">We have nothing more to discuss.
Let us return.</font>

210
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,190
<font color="yellow">Stand back.</font>

211
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,980
<font color="yellow">Stand back.</font>

212
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,460
<font color="yellow">You know what will happen if
you refuse a royal command.</font>

213
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,940
<font color="yellow">Let her go, So.
How can you refuse a royal command?</font>

214
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,860
<font color="yellow">All our brothers will die because of her.</font>

215
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,900
<font color="yellow">I told you not to move.</font>

216
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,470
<font color="yellow">I think I have to go.</font>

217
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,220
<font color="yellow">If you leave now,
it will be hard to leave the palace.</font>

218
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,270
<font color="yellow">I must go.</font>

219
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,050
<font color="yellow">That's the only way no one gets hurt.</font>

220
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,830
<font color="yellow">You really won't regret it?</font>

221
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,330
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

222
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,580
<font color="yellow">I'll go and try to talk to him.</font>

223
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,340
<font color="yellow">Please sit in the palanquin.</font>

224
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,810
<font color="yellow">Back to the palace!</font>

225
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,810
<font color="yellow">That stupid girl.</font>

226
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,970
<font color="yellow">An old man over 60 with many sons?</font>

227
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,300
<font color="yellow">It was the king!</font>

228
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,200
<font color="yellow">Where did you hear that?</font>

229
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,860
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not going to end up
marrying Taejo, am I?</i></font>

230
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,940
<font color="yellow"><i>No, it's not even right that
I'm living here in Goryeo.</i></font>

231
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Who knows what else could go wrong?</i></font>

232
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,730
<font color="yellow"><i>You need keep your head on straight.</i></font>

233
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,610
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't let yourself panic.</i></font>

234
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,180
<font color="yellow"><i>You have to get through this.
You have to survive.</i></font>

235
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,270
<font color="yellow"><i>[Damiwon Palace]</i></font>

236
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,780
<font color="yellow">Switch the herbal pouch in one hour.</font>

237
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,070
<font color="yellow">Royal Concubine Oh!</font>

238
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,130
<font color="yellow">Astronomer Ji Mong has news
of the king's new bride.</font>

239
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,230
<font color="yellow">When? And who is she?</font>

240
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,640
<font color="yellow">The Damiwon was built to take care</font>

241
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,720
<font color="yellow">of the mind and body
of the king and the princes.</font>

242
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,120
<font color="yellow">You will prepare for the
marriage here, Lady Soo.</font>

243
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,150
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

244
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,260
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard anything
about this marriage at all.</font>

245
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to the king.</font>

246
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,560
<font color="yellow">But can you inform him that I think
there has been some sort of mistake?</font>

247
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,100
<font color="yellow">You want to turn down
a marriage to the king?</font>

248
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,000
<font color="yellow">It's not just the king.
It would be the same for his grandfather.</font>

249
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,100
<font color="yellow">I have no intention of marrying
a man I don't know.</font>

250
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,370
<font color="yellow">Oh my, Royal Concubine Oh!</font>

251
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,360
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you for so long that
my eyes became this big all the time.</font>

252
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,350
<font color="yellow">Is that her?</font>

253
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,860
<font color="yellow">This is Lady Soo of
Hong Ha Jin Hae's household.</font>

254
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,210
<font color="yellow">Now that you are here,
your subject will leave now.</font>

255
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,970
<font color="yellow">Just follow your fate.</font>

256
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,220
<font color="yellow">Astronomer.</font>

257
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
<font color="yellow">From now on, do not refer to yourself
as a lower person in front of us.</font>

258
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,990
<font color="yellow">Ah, that was...</font>

259
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,370
<font color="yellow">Bring the lady.</font>

260
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,700
<font color="yellow">Please come.</font>

261
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,900
<font color="yellow">She's difficult... so difficult.</font>

262
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,340
<font color="yellow">What did the king see
in a woman like that?</font>

263
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,190
<font color="yellow">We will search your body briefly
before you wash up.</font>

264
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,330
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

265
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,010
<font color="yellow">A woman with scars on her body
cannot be the king's wife.</font>

266
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,290
<font color="yellow">So you must be examined.</font>

267
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,650
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be.</font>

268
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,000
<font color="yellow">I don't have scars.</font>

269
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,990
<font color="yellow">I don't like people looking at me.
I never even go to public baths.</font>

270
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,570
<font color="yellow">So how can you tell me to undress?</font>

271
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,190
<font color="yellow">Oh! What are you doing?
What are you doing?</font>

272
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,180
<font color="yellow">- Hold on!
- You will be sharing a room tonight.</font>

273
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,440
<font color="yellow">It will not take long,
so forgive me for the lack of courtesy.</font>

274
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,790
<font color="yellow">Sharing a room? Wait, just wait!</font>

275
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,060
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I told you to stop!</font>

276
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,180
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

277
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,430
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you heard about
the king's marriage.</font>

278
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,250
<font color="yellow">Will you not stop him?</font>

279
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,840
<font color="yellow">He's doing it for national interests.
Is it something I should speak up about?</font>

280
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,270
<font color="yellow">You always carry around your Buddhist
prayer beads and now you're like a saint.</font>

281
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,750
<font color="yellow">His Majesty already has 29 concubines.</font>

282
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,640
<font color="yellow">He should consider his family
before he considers national interests.</font>

283
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,960
<font color="yellow">Is he planning on splitting the nation
into 25 parts once he passes away?</font>

284
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,410
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a thing?</font>

285
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,950
<font color="yellow"><i>The 14th Prince is here.</i></font>

286
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,460
<font color="yellow">Tell him to come in.</font>

287
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,090
<font color="yellow">The 14th Prince greets you,
Queen Hwangbo.</font>

288
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,290
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

289
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,020
<font color="yellow">Help me, Mother.</font>

290
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,670
<font color="yellow">You know Soo from
my eighth brother's home?</font>

291
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,720
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo is marrying the king.
Please stop it.</font>

292
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,500
<font color="yellow">She was the one he is marrying?</font>

293
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,830
<font color="yellow">You seemed relaxed about it.
Was it because you're related to her?</font>

294
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,700
<font color="yellow">Who can stop the king's marriage?</font>

295
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,590
<font color="yellow">It's not your place to step in.</font>

296
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,300
<font color="yellow">It's her household forcing it on her.
Soo does not wish to marry.</font>

297
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,790
<font color="yellow">Mother...</font>

298
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,380
<font color="yellow"><i>The 8th Prince is here.</i></font>

299
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,390
<font color="yellow">The 8th Prince greets you, Queen Yoo.</font>

300
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,020
<font color="yellow">Why brings you by unexpectedly?</font>

301
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,680
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- You're here about Hae Soo too, right?</font>

302
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,630
<font color="yellow">You see? This is a big problem.</font>

303
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,820
<font color="yellow">You have to resolve this, Mother.</font>

304
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,760
<font color="yellow">I know you can do it.</font>

305
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,270
<font color="yellow">Wook.</font>

306
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,920
<font color="yellow">Does this marriage truly bother you?</font>

307
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,180
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

308
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,040
<font color="yellow">To me, she is like a younger sister.</font>

309
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,110
<font color="yellow">It is also very sudden.</font>

310
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,510
<font color="yellow">- Also--
- She is the cousin of his dead wife.</font>

311
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,480
<font color="yellow">Of course he would be conflicted.</font>

312
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,860
<font color="yellow">It's a marriage to the king.</font>

313
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,900
<font color="yellow">I wonder why you would be so conflicted.</font>

314
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,430
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

315
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,580
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

316
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,370
<font color="yellow">You have to find a way to get Soo out!</font>

317
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,390
<font color="yellow">She came in on her own.
Let her endure it on her own.</font>

318
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,730
<font color="yellow">If she had persisted and stayed,
we would have all died.</font>

319
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,240
<font color="yellow">Whatever the case,
she should have run if she chose to.</font>

320
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,840
<font color="yellow">- No one can stop it now.
- So!</font>

321
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,170
<font color="yellow">Do you, by chance, have feelings for her?</font>

322
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,800
<font color="yellow">Is this why you're doing this?</font>

323
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,810
<font color="yellow">It's not me who does.</font>

324
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,860
<font color="yellow">Anyway, she is a bit special to me.</font>

325
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,970
<font color="yellow"><i>It was after Myung Hee died,
and we were drinking together every day.</i></font>

326
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,470
<font color="yellow">If you liked Myung Hee so much,
why couldn't you tell her even once?</font>

327
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,330
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

328
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,850
<font color="yellow">Well, my mother...</font>

329
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,400
<font color="yellow">She is a Shilla royal family member,
which is now fallen.</font>

330
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,430
<font color="yellow">We may all be princes,
but we're not at the same level.</font>

331
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,830
<font color="yellow">Back then, your family
had a high standing.</font>

332
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,330
<font color="yellow">I was not in a position to be
able to ask for Myung Hee.</font>

333
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,240
<font color="yellow">Ah, there you go again!</font>

334
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,820
<font color="yellow">Please stop talking about
taking people or whatever.</font>

335
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,350
<font color="yellow">This place always treats people
like they are property.</font>

336
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,640
<font color="yellow">Just wait a thousand years.</font>

337
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,840
<font color="yellow">There is no one above any other person.</font>

338
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,340
<font color="yellow">There is no one below you.</font>

339
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,720
<font color="yellow">Prince? Psh.</font>

340
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,500
<font color="yellow">Be careful with what you're saying.</font>

341
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,910
<font color="yellow">How long is life anyway?</font>

342
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,570
<font color="yellow">- You're always going on and on...
- Be quiet.</font>

343
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,050
<font color="yellow">Your status is this,
and this prince is that.</font>

344
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

345
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,580
<font color="yellow">Baek Ah... look here.</font>

346
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,590
<font color="yellow">You could be living well,
and still just end up dying one day.</font>

347
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,430
<font color="yellow">You can fall right out of the sky</font>

348
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,670
<font color="yellow">then end up living in a place like this.</font>

349
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,240
<font color="yellow">So, just follow your heart and live.</font>

350
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,780
<font color="yellow">Do everything you want to do
and live however you want.</font>

351
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,840
<font color="yellow">However!</font>

352
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,850
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

353
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,300
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

354
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

355
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,670
<font color="yellow">She spoke recklessly like that
and you just listened?</font>

356
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,030
<font color="yellow">She didn't say anything wrong.</font>

357
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,960
<font color="yellow">Look around Goryeo.
Family connections are everything.</font>

358
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,300
<font color="yellow">You only get treated well if you're born
from a good family and good-looking.</font>

359
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,210
<font color="yellow">You only get recognition
if you marry well.</font>

360
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,500
<font color="yellow">It's this bad for us, and we are princes.</font>

361
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,660
<font color="yellow">How bad is it for the people?</font>

362
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,700
<font color="yellow">So, what?</font>

363
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,010
<font color="yellow">Do you want to overthrow the throne?</font>

364
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,820
<font color="yellow">Are you going to change this nation?</font>

365
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,990
<font color="yellow">I only want to be free.</font>

366
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,950
<font color="yellow">That's what you want too.
What about Hae Soo?</font>

367
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,940
<font color="yellow">How can a girl with no parents
or siblings survive in this place?</font>

368
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,480
<font color="yellow">Once today passes...</font>

369
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,510
<font color="yellow">she will never even see the king.</font>

370
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,240
<font color="yellow">She will suffocate and die like this.</font>

371
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,550
<font color="yellow">We are finished examining you.
You may wash up now.</font>

372
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,440
<font color="yellow">I want to be alone.</font>

373
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,390
<font color="yellow">You will marry once the sun sets.</font>

374
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,400
<font color="yellow">The king is waiting, so now--</font>

375
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,880
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

376
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,070
<font color="yellow">Even this morning,
I didn't know this would happen to me.</font>

377
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,960
<font color="yellow">I need time to figure out
what is happening.</font>

378
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,330
<font color="yellow">Wait here a moment.
I will check on the bath.</font>

379
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,910
<font color="yellow">Marriage?</font>

380
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,820
<font color="yellow">Sharing a room?</font>

381
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,090
<font color="yellow">I have to leave, but to where?</font>

382
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,510
<font color="yellow">Ah, that secret tunnel!</font>

383
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,730
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the entrance is here.</font>

384
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,580
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

385
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,310
<font color="yellow">Hong Ha Jin Hae's household has
handed over their daughter, Soo.</font>

386
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,910
<font color="yellow">She is ready for the marriage.</font>

387
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,340
<font color="yellow">Did you say Soo?</font>

388
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,660
<font color="yellow">Is she the cousin of my 8th son's wife,
who passed away?</font>

389
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, she is.</font>

390
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,300
<font color="yellow">Why did it have to be that girl?</font>

391
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,520
<font color="yellow">Those people are full of greed.</font>

392
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,730
<font color="yellow">Would you like to stop the marriage?</font>

393
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,690
<font color="yellow">It will too cumbersome to do so</font>

394
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,370
<font color="yellow">and where will I find
another suitable girl?</font>

395
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,540
<font color="yellow">It is fine, so let's go.</font>

396
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,930
<font color="yellow">Isn't that you, Wook?</font>

397
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,570
<font color="yellow">I have dared to come and discuss
a matter with you, Your Majesty.</font>

398
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,480
<font color="yellow">An intelligent boy like you
is blocking my path?</font>

399
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,230
<font color="yellow">The royal family already
has many in-laws.</font>

400
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,230
<font color="yellow">The other powerful families are trying
to keep the royal family in check.</font>

401
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:50,610
<font color="yellow">I am curious to know why you
need to bring in another household.</font>

402
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,580
<font color="yellow">I have very good justification.</font>

403
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,510
<font color="yellow">I need the help of the Haes in order to
stop a war from breaking out with Khitan.</font>

404
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,760
<font color="yellow">As for you, what is your reason
for stopping this marriage?</font>

405
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,540
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

406
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,640
<font color="yellow">What if you did not have
to use this method?</font>

407
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,560
<font color="yellow">What do you all think you're doing?</font>

408
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Your Majesty.</i></font>

409
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,420
<font color="yellow"><i>Please hear us and stop this marriage.</i></font>

410
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,420
<font color="yellow">You must not care about your lives!</font>

411
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,450
<font color="yellow">I have found a witness who saw
Hong Ha Jin Hae conspiring with Khitan.</font>

412
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,460
<font color="yellow">You should punish the Haes.</font>

413
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,890
<font color="yellow">Leave the border to another family.</font>

414
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,480
<font color="yellow">You could let the Haes be
magistrate of their town.</font>

415
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,050
<font color="yellow">Reconciliation is possible, as well.</font>

416
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,580
<font color="yellow">You do not need marriage.</font>

417
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,870
<font color="yellow">There are other ways to
cut down the Haes' strength.</font>

418
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,360
<font color="yellow">Must you offer to make them your in-laws?</font>

419
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,800
<font color="yellow">Minister.</font>

420
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,290
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

421
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,350
<font color="yellow">I will proceed with the marriage.</font>

422
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,650
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

423
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,730
<font color="yellow">If I punish the Haes for conspiracy
like you suggest</font>

424
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,930
<font color="yellow">it will take half a day to send the army
and the borders will be breached.</font>

425
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,560
<font color="yellow">If I tried to teach the Haes a lesson...</font>

426
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,390
<font color="yellow">would you not fear the actions
of the other powerful families?</font>

427
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:30,880
<font color="yellow">In the palace, it is not right
to look for a reason to act.</font>

428
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,250
<font color="yellow">You must look for a good excuse
to stop it from happening.</font>

429
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,920
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

430
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,620
<font color="yellow">Your reason...</font>

431
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,560
<font color="yellow">is not good enough.</font>

432
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,580
<font color="yellow">Soo.</font>

433
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,870
<font color="yellow">That reason...</font>

434
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,330
<font color="yellow">I will give it to you.</font>

435
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,590
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

436
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,830
<font color="yellow">My body... if there is a scar...</font>

437
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,930
<font color="yellow">I cannot become a king's wife.</font>

438
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,610
<font color="yellow">So, Your Majesty, please stop.</font>

439
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,680
<font color="yellow">Let me go now.</font>

440
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,060
<font color="yellow">You are more courageous than a man.</font>

441
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,890
<font color="yellow">Bring in Hong Ha Jin Hae.</font>

442
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,510
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

443
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,870
<font color="yellow">Soo!</font>

444
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,070
<font color="yellow">Soo!</font>

445
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,980
<font color="yellow">Soo...</font>

446
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,630
<font color="yellow">Soo!</font>

447
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,880
<font color="yellow">- Soo!
- Sis, Sis!</font>

448
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,470
<font color="yellow">Call a doctor!</font>

449
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,560
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

450
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,960
<font color="yellow">Soo! Hurry.</font>

451
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,970
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

452
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,130
<font color="yellow"><i>Where am I?</i></font>

453
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,630
<font color="yellow"><i>Right, I died... but I didn't.</i></font>

454
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,450
<font color="yellow"><i>Goryeo... Taejo Wang Geon.</i></font>

455
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,670
<font color="yellow"><i>Gwangjong?</i></font>

456
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Something about Gwangjong
is bothering me.</i></font>

457
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,150
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm forgetting something.</i></font>

458
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Goryeo's fourth king, Gwangjong.</i></font>

459
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,480
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, Gwangjong is the fourth king.</i></font>

460
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,690
<font color="yellow"><i>He was a king who killed
his brothers and his subjects.</i></font>

461
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,030
<font color="yellow"><i>Goryeo's fourth King, Gwangjong.</i></font>

462
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Who is it?</i></font>

463
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,210
<font color="yellow"><i>Which one of the princes is it?</i></font>

464
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,380
<font color="yellow"><i>Could it possibly be...</i></font>

465
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,230
<font color="yellow">It's not.</font>

466
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,310
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

467
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,610
<font color="yellow">You have not died and you are alive.</font>

468
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,430
<font color="yellow">You're still unmarried.</font>

469
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,840
<font color="yellow">So I watched over you
instead of a doctor.</font>

470
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,490
<font color="yellow">This is the palace, right?</font>

471
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,130
<font color="yellow">You haven't died yet,
so you are still in the palace.</font>

472
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,260
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that I can't
leave this place unless I die?</font>

473
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,830
<font color="yellow">The doctor says the wound is deep
and you will have a scar.</font>

474
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,890
<font color="yellow">I expected it.</font>

475
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,250
<font color="yellow">Did you hate the idea of being
the king's wife that much?</font>

476
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,860
<font color="yellow">You would've had all the wealth
and prosperity you could wish for.</font>

477
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,260
<font color="yellow">No matter how I live,
I'm going to have the right to choose.</font>

478
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,650
<font color="yellow">That's what people think
when they are young.</font>

479
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,120
<font color="yellow">You will be punished soon.</font>

480
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,430
<font color="yellow">You should prepare yourself for that.</font>

481
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,290
<font color="yellow">I don't regret it.</font>

482
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,230
<font color="yellow">I protected what I wanted.</font>

483
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,370
<font color="yellow">I should pay for it.</font>

484
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,430
<font color="yellow">Then rest up.</font>

485
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,250
<font color="yellow">Everything will be all right now.</font>

486
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,960
<font color="yellow">It's all over now.</font>

487
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,470
<font color="yellow">The king...</font>

488
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,970
<font color="yellow">Because...</font>

489
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,900
<font color="yellow">Because of the scar of your body,
he has canceled the marriage.</font>

490
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,590
<font color="yellow">The Hae household...</font>

491
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,010
<font color="yellow">It's been determined that they've
gone against national interests.</font>

492
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,660
<font color="yellow">Your household will not
pressure you anymore.</font>

493
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,220
<font color="yellow">Last night...</font>

494
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,510
<font color="yellow">I felt so pathetic.</font>

495
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,910
<font color="yellow">And pathetic.</font>

496
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:57,010
<font color="yellow">And pathetic, yet again.</font>

497
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,530
<font color="yellow">I thought to myself
that I was a bad person.</font>

498
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,780
<font color="yellow">Yet, I prayed to my dead wife.</font>

499
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,550
<font color="yellow">I said if you were returned to me...</font>

500
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,030
<font color="yellow">I would pay her back by giving you
the affection I could never give her.</font>

501
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,370
<font color="yellow">I asked her for forgiveness
and to send you to me.</font>

502
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,810
<font color="yellow">I begged her.</font>

503
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,200
<font color="yellow">If you had become the king's woman...</font>

504
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,610
<font color="yellow">I would never have forgiven myself.</font>

505
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,310
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

506
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,730
<font color="yellow">I would never see you again.</font>

507
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,700
<font color="yellow">I never got to say goodbye to you.</font>

508
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,110
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it was right
to part like that.</font>

509
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,470
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

510
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,550
<font color="yellow">This will not happen again.</font>

511
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,180
<font color="yellow">I lost you once.</font>

512
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,120
<font color="yellow">I won't let that happen again, so...</font>

513
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,050
<font color="yellow">it's all right.</font>

514
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:39,750
<font color="yellow">Everything will be all right, Soo.</font>

515
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,530
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

516
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,090
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty, the stars are gone
and the sun is about to rise.</font>

517
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,900
<font color="yellow">You need to get some sleep
in order to preserve the throne.</font>

518
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,230
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

519
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,870
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

520
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,720
<font color="yellow">Have you determined what to do
about Soo of the Hae household?</font>

521
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,270
<font color="yellow">Though I do feel bad for her,
I can't ignore that she disobeyed orders.</font>

522
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,250
<font color="yellow">Send her to be a slave.</font>

523
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,650
<font color="yellow">Why don't we let her live
as a court lady in the palace?</font>

524
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,320
<font color="yellow">Both Queen Yoo and
Queen Hwangbo need one.</font>

525
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,860
<font color="yellow">Even Lady Gwangjuwon asked for Hae Soo.</font>

526
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the children asked for it.</font>

527
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,560
<font color="yellow">What is her relationship
to the princes, anyhow?</font>

528
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,310
<font color="yellow">The 8th and 4th even got involved.</font>

529
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,660
<font color="yellow">I do not want to cause any more trouble.</font>

530
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,330
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

531
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,320
<font color="yellow">Royal Concubine Oh of Damiwon Palace
put in a request, as well.</font>

532
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,390
<font color="yellow">Damiwon?</font>

533
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:06,280
<font color="yellow">I have heard that Hae Soo has a lot of
interest in makeup and herbal medicine.</font>

534
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,570
<font color="yellow">They say she knows a lot.</font>

535
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,090
<font color="yellow">I believe she would be a
great benefit to the royal family</font>

536
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,450
<font color="yellow">if we left her with Concubine Oh.</font>

537
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,060
<font color="yellow">Where is she now?</font>

538
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,150
<font color="yellow"><i>I would like to go see Myung Hee.</i></font>

539
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,400
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, let's go together.</i></font>

540
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,770
<font color="yellow"><i>She did ask me to look after you.</i></font>

541
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,670
<font color="yellow"><i>If we go together,
I know it will make her happy.</i></font>

542
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,820
<font color="yellow">It's enough to cancel the wedding.</font>

543
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,670
<font color="yellow">Why must she be a court lady, right?</font>

544
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:58,220
<font color="yellow">Still, isn't it a relief that
she avoided punishment?</font>

545
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,430
<font color="yellow">She could have become a slave.</font>

546
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:01,820
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

547
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,870
<font color="yellow">I had nowhere to go, anyway.</font>

548
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,580
<font color="yellow">I heard court ladies get paid.</font>

549
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,850
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing I can support myself.</font>

550
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,310
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

551
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:13,090
<font color="yellow">You're a noble lady so you will be
treated differently even as a court lady.</font>

552
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,900
<font color="yellow">If you work very hard,
the king may let you marry.</font>

553
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,150
<font color="yellow">He will let you out on trips too,
so work hard.</font>

554
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,120
<font color="yellow">Trips? Really?</font>

555
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,620
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

556
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,830
<font color="yellow">Lady Soo. Should we get going?</font>

557
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,110
<font color="yellow">I think it may be difficult to go see
Myung Hee for the time being.</font>

558
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,620
<font color="yellow">Like Choi Ji Mong said</font>

559
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,530
<font color="yellow">it's a relief that
you avoided punishment.</font>

560
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,780
<font color="yellow">Do not worry too much.</font>

561
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,250
<font color="yellow">I'm not worried.</font>

562
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,110
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can't do,
and I'm smart.</font>

563
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:56,140
<font color="yellow">So, I'm a fast learner.</font>

564
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,520
<font color="yellow">I'll become someone who is needed.</font>

565
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,780
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

566
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,590
<font color="yellow">I will visit you every day.</font>

567
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,810
<font color="yellow">Soo!</font>

568
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,470
<font color="yellow">- Sis!
- Soo!</font>

569
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,420
<font color="yellow">Soo, Soo!</font>

570
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,160
<font color="yellow">Move, would you?</font>

571
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,150
<font color="yellow">Soo, I thought you had died.</font>

572
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,920
<font color="yellow">Stop making people worry.</font>

573
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,950
<font color="yellow">How could you do that to your body?</font>

574
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,800
<font color="yellow">That's enough now.</font>

575
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,250
<font color="yellow">If you wear her down on her first day,
Concubine Oh will not be happy.</font>

576
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, she won't be.</font>

577
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,170
<font color="yellow">Concubine Oh is really scary.</font>

578
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,330
<font color="yellow">I will visit often, so don't worry.</font>

579
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,960
<font color="yellow"><i>It's one out of these two or three.</i></font>

580
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,880
<font color="yellow"><i>The next king is here.</i></font>

581
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,400
<font color="yellow"><i>Who is it?</i></font>

582
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Who's going to become Gwangjong
and kill his brothers?</i></font>

583
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,790
<font color="yellow"><i>No! That can't happen.</i></font>

584
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,620
<font color="yellow"><i>It can't be...</i></font>

585
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,100
<font color="yellow">Your life is quite something.</font>

586
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,260
<font color="yellow">How many times have you almost died?</font>

587
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,030
<font color="yellow">Next time, you will definitely die--</font>

588
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,190
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

589
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,600
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

590
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,890
<font color="yellow">Come on, Lady Soo.</font>

591
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,060
<font color="yellow">You must go alone from here on.</font>

592
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,800
<font color="yellow">Royal Concubine Oh will be waiting.</font>

593
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,790
<font color="yellow">Soo, go get it!</font>

594
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,920
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be afraid.
You know that, right?</font>

595
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,580
