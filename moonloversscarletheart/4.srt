5
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,940
Who's there?

6
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,740
It is me, Mother.

7
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,650
How dare you come in here?

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,010
Why are you here?

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,390
Do you know what I've done for you?

10
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,460
I made sure no one could kill you.

11
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,250
I erased all traces of you.

12
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,300
What are you saying?

13
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
I cannot understand you at all.

14
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,210
I've burned it all down.

15
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,390
Nothing will lead back to you, Mother.

16
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,230
You didn't kill them all, did you?

17
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,550
They only lived because of you.

18
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,910
They will not hold it against you
that they died for you.

19
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,380
Did you think I'd tell you
that you did a good job?

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,770
Did you want me to ask if
you had injured yourself?

21
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,110
You're like an animal.

22
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,000
Leave!

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,160
You stink of blood and I cannot sleep.

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,370
- It was for you, Mother...
- Mother, Mother, Mother!

25
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,300
Hearing you call me "Mother"
makes my skin crawl.

26
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,870
I do not wish to see you, so go! Go now!

27
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,500
I have always been curious.

28
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,230
Why doesn't Mother feel pity for me?

29
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,030
If you were my mother,
you would care if I were injured.

30
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,620
So, why doesn't my mother
ever look back at me?

31
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,250
I waited so desperately for it.

32
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,610
- Not once...
- You are not my son.

33
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,670
You are the son of the Kangs in Shinju.

34
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,950
It is my face, isn't it?

35
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,810
You sent me to be adopted
instead of my older brother.

36
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,700
And you continue to turn your back on me.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,920
It's all because of this face!

38
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,550
Do you know how my life was
with the Kangs?

39
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,050
Once, they threw me into
the biggest wolves den in Shinju.

40
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,240
I spent all night fighting the animals
with their gnashing teeth.

41
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,270
Then I burned down the entire mountain.

42
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,990
I burned and killed all of them in there.

43
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,520
And I lived.

44
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,990
The revolting stench of burning flesh
was still on my body.

45
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,510
The crazy Concubine Kang...

46
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:56,050
She wouldn't let me out of her sight,
thinking I was her dead son.

47
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,810
Then she'd come to her senses,
beat me, and lock me up.

48
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,530
She'd demand to know where her son was.

49
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,270
Asking why there was
an unsightly monster...

50
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,170
It could be three days, or four.

51
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,500
I didn't get one sip of water,
but no one came to check on me.

52
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,910
What about it?

53
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,960
A mother only recognizes a son
who will make her shine.

54
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,830
You are my shame, disgrace, and flaw.

55
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,580
That's why I sent you away.

56
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,700
Thanks to you,
I felt a sense of love and justice.

57
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,690
I will thank you for that.

58
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,730
Today is a day you will remember.

59
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,000
You threw me away, Mother.

60
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,660
However, I will not leave.

61
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,760
From now on...

62
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,690
you will have to look only at me.

63
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,490
Nonsense!

64
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,310
If you do something like this again,
you'll never step foot in Songak again!

65
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,970
That impudent boy.

66
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,110
- Stop, stop!
- All of it, be gone!

67
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,080
Please stop! Stop!

68
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,590
Move!

69
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,680
B... blood.

70
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,160
Yes, it's blood.

71
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,950
It's the blood of those I killed today.

72
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,610
Mothers build this for their children?

73
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,540
She shouldn't come to this thing.
She should come beg to me!

74
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,900
Let go! Let me go!

75
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,140
Stop it now.

76
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,980
Do you want to die too? Let me go.

77
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,490
You're injured!

78
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,260
Do you have any other injuries?

79
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,710
I told you that I killed people.

80
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,480
Then, tell me why you killed them.

81
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,870
Did you... do it for fun?

82
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,580
Go.

83
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,370
Go!

84
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,300
This is that kind of a place, isn't it?

85
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,330
You have to wield a sword
at a very young age.

86
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,380
You have to kill others
if you want to live.

87
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,890
What can you do?

88
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,200
It's not a crime to want to live.

89
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,390
You probably won't be forgiven.

90
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,100
Still, I understand you.

91
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,290
How you're feeling right now...

92
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,740
it must be so miserable.

93
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,610
I think I can relate.

94
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,840
We chased the assassins the night of
the ritual and we found no leads.

95
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,380
The person who hired them
killed them to keep them quiet.

96
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,650
We found the temple that
seems to be their headquarters.

97
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,510
They had already been killed
and the temple was burning.

98
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,700
However...

99
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,660
the owner of that temple is...

100
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,590
That temple belongs to Queen Yoo.

101
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,030
Are you saying that
I'm behind the assassination?

102
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,190
That I tried to kill the Crown Prince?

103
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,330
Anyone would assume so.

104
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,020
Queen Yoo.

105
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,640
Did you plot an assassination
to kill the Crown Prince?

106
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,200
And bring in assassins?

107
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,890
I did no such thing.

108
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,950
Your Majesty, it is all my fault.

109
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,660
I never knew it was such a temple.

110
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,220
I was the benefactor of the temple
in place of Mother.

111
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,290
Take my life, Your Majesty.

112
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,450
It is all my fault.

113
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,360
If a child has done wrong,
then so has the mother.

114
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,730
I did it.

115
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,630
The killing and the fire in the temple...

116
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,240
I did it.

117
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,410
Are you saying you tried to
kill the Crown Prince?

118
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,070
Your Majesty, the assassins live in
a temple that the queen owns.

119
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,580
They impersonated princes and
killed the assassins that night.

120
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,610
This is most definitely a trick to get
the royal family to turn on each other.

121
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,530
Just as Wook said,
I was afraid that Mother would be framed.

122
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,820
Forgive me for my poor decision.

123
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,200
You haven't done it. You do it.

124
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,590
It's your turn.

125
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,130
- I don't want to.
- You do it.

126
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,160
- You do it.
- No, I really don't want to.

127
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,570
Chae Ryung.

128
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,640
- Lady Hae.
- What is it?

129
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,740
There are guests. You should be careful.

130
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,760
Everyone is trying to avoid
taking a meal up to the 4th Prince.

131
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,150
How can you take the
prince's meal so lightly?

132
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,310
Enough now.

133
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,690
Someone take up the 4th Prince's meal.

134
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,630
I do not want to see this again.

135
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,700
Me?

136
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,180
Look at you all. I'm a lady.

137
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,090
I shouldn't be delivering meals, right?

138
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,130
Huh?

139
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,630
Why? Why doesn't he eat in his room?
Why make all this trouble?

140
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,700
I knew I didn't like him.
He's going all out.

141
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,130
Gosh, I'm tired.

142
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,490
Oh my.

143
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,790
Yesterday, he made such a commotion.

144
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,120
He sure looks innocent from the back.

145
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,850
He actually looks lonely.

146
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,160
Your meal has arrived.

147
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,110
Leave it there.

148
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,230
You'd like to eat alone in peace?

149
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,580
You do that.

150
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,180
I have to take back the empty bowls.

151
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,690
Why don't you eat quickly?

152
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,730
About yesterday, you didn't see anything.

153
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,640
Be careful what you say.

154
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,880
I wouldn't talk about that
even if I could.

155
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,060
I can't believe it,
even though I saw it myself.

156
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,450
I have my own issues.

157
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,070
I don't have time to go around
talking about other people.

158
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,290
Every time I see you,
you tell me to forget I saw you.

159
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,950
By the way, is it better
if you eat out here?

160
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,580
Oh, are you looking at
the palace over there?

161
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,240
That will eventually be your home.

162
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,570
Why must you stare at it while eating?

163
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,100
If it is home, I should have a family.

164
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,720
Huh?

165
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,300
I heard that your mother, father,
and brother all live there.

166
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,990
Now that it's come up...

167
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,280
why did you do that yesterday?

168
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,310
You! How did you get into
the palace bath that day?

169
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,970
Oh, oh, oh, I...

170
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,860
Chae Ryung says that
the chicken is the best.

171
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,200
Is the doctor not here yet?

172
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,250
Be strong, Myung Hee. Okay?

173
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,590
Soo, step outside for a moment.

174
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,900
What?

175
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,140
What is it, Lady? What is it?

176
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,410
Go on.

177
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,060
Take a second wife.

178
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,680
Wife.

179
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,070
I am a very weak person.

180
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,320
Whether it is running this household
or giving you an heir

181
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,450
I have not done anything
as your wife, Prince Wook.

182
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,750
Therefore...

183
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,120
Your Highness.

184
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,590
Marry someone else.

185
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,730
Or divorce me before that.

186
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,840
I must absolve myself of
the wrong I've done to you.

187
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,990
That way, I can die and rest in peace.

188
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,390
I do not want to.

189
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,520
You must do so.

190
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,260
Also, I know.

191
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,440
Your Highness, you do not...

192
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,310
You do not love me.

194
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,030
Stop that!

195
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,610
What are you so worried about?

196
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,700
Whatever your worries are,
you'll forget them once you play.

197
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,330
Here! I have a gift for you.

198
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,530
I didn't know what you liked

199
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,700
so I brought everything
that caught my eye.

200
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,940
A top.

201
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,150
Cards.

202
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,190
This is something I really like.
It's a slingshot that never misses.

203
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,030
You can have this too.

204
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,940
You've never seen this, have you?

205
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,030
It's a silk ball from the Qing Dynasty.

206
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,740
They say girls like it.

207
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,370
How old are you
that you play with these things?

208
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,860
Then, what do you like?

209
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,880
Gosh... I'm already so frustrated.

210
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,730
Take all of this and
go play over there, okay?

211
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,130
You need to share your burdens
in order to lighten them.

212
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,200
Is it something I can't help with?

213
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,030
I am a prince.

214
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,350
Are you married?

215
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,280
Not yet.

216
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,260
How many are you going to have?

217
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,630
I haven't thought about that yet.

218
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,460
If your wife became sick and ill,
would you bring in another woman?

219
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,660
No way!

220
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,760
I don't want to deal with the stress
of having many wives like my father.

221
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm going to find someone perfect
and be with her for 100 years.

222
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,890
It would be nice if everyone
were like you, Prince Eun.

223
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,070
You're unexpectedly pure.

224
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
She's moving quite fast on her own.

225
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,280
It's a bit fast for me.

226
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,460
<i>Put this in the 4th Prince's room
without anyone knowing.</i>

227
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,860
Don't put it in an obvious spot.
Put it where he has to search for it.

228
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,750
<i>I don't want to.</i>

229
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,090
If I run into the prince,
I'm dead right on the spot.

230
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,270
It's his to begin with.
He won't say anything if you get caught.

231
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,110
- Clean up while the prince is out.
- Yes.

232
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,260
What are you doing in here?

233
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,940
- Are you...
- No!

234
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,290
I wasn't stealing anything.

235
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,010
Tell me. What else were you stealing?

236
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,680
I was not... stealing.

237
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,600
Then, were you giving
the prince a present?

238
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,340
Whip her.

239
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,490
Wait!

240
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,540
What did she do so wrong
for you to do this?

241
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,150
She stole something important
from the 4th Prince.

242
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,280
The hairpin?

243
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,360
I told her to put it there.
She didn't steal it.

244
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,650
It isn't something you would
be able to own.

245
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,970
It doesn't make sense.

246
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,810
That's because it belongs to the prince.

247
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,670
That's why I'm saying it was stolen.

248
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,190
Whip her again.

249
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,580
Then, hit me instead.

250
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,330
I can't give you the details,
but Chae Ryung is innocent.

251
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,530
If you must whip someone,
I told her to do it, so whip me instead.

252
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,740
Lady!

253
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,590
- Tie her up.
- Yes.

254
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,060
Lady!

255
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,380
Lady...

256
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,210
Wook, you have to stop her.

257
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,880
She'll really end up getting hit.

258
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,280
Why should he stop her?
The servants need to be taught a lesson.

259
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,640
I think that servant
has been beaten enough.

260
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,320
Yeon Hwa's beatings can be quite severe.

261
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,650
Yeon Hwa...

262
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,940
Yeon Hwa!

263
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,020
Let go.

264
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,440
That's enough, now.

265
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,660
I'm in charge of running the household.

266
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,870
Let me go.

267
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,520
She belongs to me.

268
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,410
What did you just say?

269
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,160
I said that she belongs to me.

270
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,590
That hairpin is mine.

271
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,720
I should be the one who
decides what to do with her.

272
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,120
So!

273
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,680
Soo did not steal it!

274
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,690
She told me she picked it up
in front of So's room.

275
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,610
No... I saw her pick it up.

276
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,020
- Eun, even you?
- Untie Lady Hae Soo.

277
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,260
Now!

278
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,540
You were too quick
to act this time, Yeon Hwa.

279
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,020
Yeon Hwa, you did the right thing.

280
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,950
People like that need to be
put in their place.

281
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,310
The mood here is terrible.

282
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,490
I should get going.

283
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,870
I'll be going, as well.

284
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,800
Let's go, Eun.

285
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,970
She should put ointment on her wounds.

286
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,150
- Soo!
- Come on now!

287
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,580
Let go of me! I told you to let go.

288
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,720
Did you feel that sorry for her?

289
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,370
The brother I know is not someone
who would stop me like this.

290
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,310
You don't have feelings for her, do you?

291
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,420
Yeon Hwa.

292
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,070
I am sorry if I have disrespected you.

293
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,980
You said she belongs to you.

294
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,440
I came to let you know,
because you seem to be mistaken.

295
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,530
Nothing here belongs to you.

296
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,840
Not Yeon Hwa. Not Hae Soo.

297
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,950
They are all my people.

298
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,170
When it comes to my sister
or my wife's cousin...

299
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,720
do not behave carelessly again.

I'm sorry.

307
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,270
I was embarrassed to see you.

308
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,620
I pretended to sleep.

309
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,040
I know you did.

310
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,380
You're still in a lot of pain,
aren't you?

311
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,960
It's not because I was whipped.

312
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,850
I'm more upset that I was
treated in that way.

313
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,990
This place...

314
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,120
is it always this way?

315
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,170
Is it a place that disrespects you unless
you're somebody's daughter or son?

316
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:06,720
A person can tie up another
like an animal and hit them.

317
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,250
Goryeo...

318
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,640
is it like this?

319
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,430
I'm sorry I could not stop it.

320
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,910
However, I promise you this.

321
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,340
No one will ever be able to
treat you in such a manner again.

322
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,380
Trust me.

323
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,000
<i>Here I go again.</i>

324
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,770
<i>Think of Lady Hae.</i>

325
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,930
<i>If you let him come closer,
you are hurting Lady Hae.</i>

326
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,230
Oh my!

327
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,620
Ouch! Oh!

328
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,190
You bumped into me.

329
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,560
"She belongs to me"?

330
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,970
Why would you say that
and create misunderstanding?

331
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,090
Don't you know how to say thank you?

332
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,240
I saved you from a beating.

333
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,620
Before you argue about that,
you should thank me for saving you.

334
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,720
You were always acting like
you wanted to kill me.

335
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,550
I am curious about why the winds changed.

336
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,030
Thank you.

337
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,460
Why did you even have that hairpin?

338
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,670
Where did you get it?

339
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,220
You dropped it at the bath in the palace.

340
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,000
This is all because I was keeping
quiet about seeing your face...

341
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,730
So, I didn't say I saw your face.

342
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,530
I kept my promise.

343
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,300
Aren't you even scared of me?

344
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,960
You talk back to me every single time.

345
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,330
You don't seem like a person
I should take lightly.

346
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,220
But I'm not scared of you anymore.

347
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,580
However, do not say I
"belong" to you ever again.

348
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,830
Why not?

349
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,090
I'm a person, not an item or an animal.

350
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,050
How can you say I belong to you
or anyone else?

351
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,580
Then...

352
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,590
Should I call you my "person"?

353
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,860
That's not it either.

354
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,900
Let's refrain from these
burdensome titles.

355
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,220
Think of something else.

356
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,800
Look, isn't it the 14th Prince?

357
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,530
Let go of me!

358
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,720
- Oh.
- Let me go.

359
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,760
I told you to let me go!

360
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,840
Oh no.

361
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,500
Isn't that the 14th Prince?

362
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,800
It is.

363
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,470
Hey!

364
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,340
You should go get someone.

365
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,730
- What about you?
- The two of us aren't enough.

366
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,010
I have to follow them,
so you go get help.

367
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,080
Hurry, hurry! Go now!

368
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,090
Let me go! Let go!

369
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,440
You don't know who you're dealing with.

370
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,890
Don't you care about your lives?

371
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,820
Prince Jung, you're the one
who made my arm this way.

372
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,220
- You went too far.
- I've never done such a thing.

373
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,310
That's true.

374
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,550
You only lost to me in a fight.

375
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,900
It was your mother who did this to me.

376
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,750
I knew nothing about that.

377
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,780
Therefore...

378
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,730
Let go of me. I told you to let go!

379
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,540
Is anyone there?

380
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,240
Oh no...

381
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,040
All right.

382
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,510
Accept it. Do it!

383
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,000
Hey!

384
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,510
Move it! Out of the way, you punks!

385
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,750
Get back, get back!

386
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,290
I'll pull out your intestines
and make stew with them.

387
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,550
What do you think you're looking at?
You're dead if you come any closer!

388
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,960
You're dead if you come closer!
Don't look at me, you punk!

389
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,020
Get the hell away from us, you bastards!

390
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,430
My daughter-in-law looks sicker
every time I see her.

391
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,070
She has suggested divorce to Wook.

392
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,940
- We should be thankful.
- What?

393
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,030
Is that true?

394
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,290
I will not turn my back on my wife.

395
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,160
I want you to pretend
you did not hear about it.

396
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,830
You need to consider marrying again
for the sake of your future.

397
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,770
Are you suggesting I marry for
obvious, political reasons

398
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,920
like our third brother did?

399
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,100
I will lose favor with the king.

400
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,420
There are many ways to avoid suspicion.

401
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,440
Yeon Hwa!

402
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,100
It's because of the Hae household that
we can walk on Songak ground again.

403
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,050
I think it's only right that we
do not forget to repay that debt.

404
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,910
- She is ill.
- Mother!

405
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,080
<i>Prince Wook! Prince Wook!</i>

406
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,120
- Prince...
- You.

407
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,060
Prince, something has
happened to Lady Soo.

408
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,090
You must go now!

409
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,880
Oh!

410
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,240
You're okay, right?

411
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,020
I'm sorry you had to get involved.

412
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,240
For now... let's run.

413
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,420
Run? What?

414
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,010
Let's just run for it.

415
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,580
I can't go like this.
I'm going to just...

416
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,490
Are you insane? Let's go.

417
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,620
Oh my goodness. Oh my!

418
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,440
What do I do?

419
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,850
Prince Jung!

420
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,280
Don't worry. I promise I'll save you.

421
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,330
Who's saving whom?

422
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,840
Stop!

423
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,870
Wook.

00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,710
Wook.

426
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,280
Are you hurt?

427
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,800
I can endure it.

428
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,270
And you?

429
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,590
Get him!

430
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,010
Overconfidence is your greatest enemy.
Do you not know that saying?

431
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,050
That is true.

432
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,840
Wolf... wolf...

433
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,680
Overconfidence is your greatest enemy.

434
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,530
It's the wolf dog.
What do we do? The wolf dog.

435
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,240
Shouldn't we run away?

436
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,440
You're not running even after seeing me?

437
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,960
Are you all brave?

438
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,190
Or...

439
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,190
do you all want to die?

440
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,470
Run.

441
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,750
Are you hurt?

442
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,200
I'm not hurt.

443
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,860
It's a relief that So came.

444
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,570
I won't forget what you did for me, Wook.

445
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,030
You saved my arm,
so I'll remember that.

446
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,960
Your life will be like my own life.

447
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,380
Even if I have to die,
I will save your life.

448
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,730
Oh... oh dear.

449
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,970
Oh, our youngest prince.

450
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,530
You're already so reliable and strong.
You'll be a great man soon.

451
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,950
Oh!

452
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,020
I'm sorry.

453
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,140
You reminded me of a little brother
I have back home.

454
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,060
It's okay.

455
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,500
Hae Soo... sister.

456
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,960
Sister?

457
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,820
Please watch over me to see
what kind of man I become.

458
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,250
Of course. Prince Jung, go get it!

459
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,860
Go... get...

460
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,890
It!

461
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,750
Go get it!

462
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,680
Go get it.

463
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,960
Go get it.

464
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,730
Wait for me.

465
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,070
Slow down a bit!

466
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,110
Are you angry?

467
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,280
Why?

468
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,180
Oh... oh my.

469
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,150
My leg hurts so much that I can't walk.

470
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,710
Oh, I was running to
get away from those men.

471
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,010
I didn't even know
that I had hurt my leg.

472
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,330
How much did I injure myself?

473
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,390
I don't think I can take another step.

474
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,700
I thought I had lost you.

475
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,470
What?

476
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,960
I... thought I wouldn't be able
to see you again.

477
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,240
I was scared.

478
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,660
- Lady Soo!
- Prince Wook!

479
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,020
Over there!

480
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,340
Lady!

481
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,190
Lady, are you okay?

482
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,770
What about the 14th Prince?

483
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,200
He's okay too.

484
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:57,940
Soo!

485
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,980
Myung Hee, I made you worry. I'm sorry.

486
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,120
We sent out the men.

487
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,450
You and the prince were gone,
so we worried.

488
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,980
Mother was worried.

489
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,710
Go to the palace tomorrow...

490
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,190
Wook!

491
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,040
You even disguise yourself and go out?

492
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,320
I came here in case Mother finds out.

493
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,820
Thank you for your discretion
and consideration.

494
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,300
This kind of outing must be common
if you know people like that.

495
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,820
I just happened to be unlucky.

496
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,090
You were unlucky?

497
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,910
Because of you, a man lost an arm
and his household was ruined.

498
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,260
Unlucky?

499
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,910
How will you take care of it?

500
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,020
I told you that I didn't know!
I didn't do it.

501
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,830
If you didn't know about it,
do you hold no responsibility?

502
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,920
You're a prince.

503
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,800
Don't you know you hold more
responsibility the higher up you are?

504
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,410
That's very funny.

505
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,350
Since when were you ever in
such a high position?

506
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,670
Ah...

507
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,710
Are you acting like this because you're
the only one Mother treats coldly?

508
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,540
Or are you pushing down a
younger brother who might show off?

509
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,400
Yo is right about you.

510
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:46,230
It's embarrassing to have been
born from the same womb as you.

511
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,020
Stupid kid.

512
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,480
- So.
- You...

513
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,710
- Move!
- Mother!

514
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,270
Don't go near him.

515
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,010
Jung, you'll be in danger.

516
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:04,140
Mother, it was So who saved me.

517
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,790
- I would've lost my arm if not for him.
- Don't be fooled.

518
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,780
He brings misfortune to anyone near him.

519
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,230
I went through it too.
You can't suffer it as well.

520
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,030
Do not go near him.

521
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,670
Still, it was So who saved me.

522
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,470
I want you to say it.

523
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:25,200
Say you won't go near Jung. Say it now!

524
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,520
If that's what you want,
that's what I'll do.

525
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,060
How long are you going to live
being protected by her?

526
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,400
Jung, let me take a look.
Where were you hurt?

527
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,350
Jung, Jung.

528
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,990
What are these wounds?

529
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,630
Jung!

530
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,050
My heart feels ripped apart
when you get hurt.

531
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,820
What are you all doing?
Get a doctor now!

00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,880
- Move!
- Mother!

534
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,000
Don't go near him.

535
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,740
Jung, you'll be in danger.

536
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,280
You want the 4th Prince
to live in Songak?

537
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,980
Is it repayment for the fact
that he saved you?

538
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,270
I wish to keep him by my side
as one of my people.

539
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:19,890
Your Majesty.

540
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,800
I saw the 4th Prince's star
rising above Songak.

541
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,690
This must have been the reason for it.

542
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,650
The 4th Prince's star combines with
the Crown Prince's Ursa Major...

543
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,870
Your mother tried to
kill the Crown Prince.

544
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,990
Your older brother desires
to be the Crown Prince.

545
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,240
I have never shared their goals.

546
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:49,850
Then, what will you do about the
reason you were first adopted?

547
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,830
You were sent there to console
Concubine Kang who lost her son.

548
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,760
Not even for a day...

549
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,990
was I considered a son.
I was merely a hostage.

550
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,080
Should you not know that better,
Your Majesty?

551
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,480
What will you be to the Crown Prince?

552
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:26,900
Will you be a Chungju Yoo
or a Shinju Kang?

553
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,500
I will live as a loyal subject
of you and the Crown Prince.

554
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,130
I will not be a son or a brother,
but a loyal subject.

555
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,960
Ji Mong.

556
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

557
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,020
Did you say that the
4th Prince's star rose over Songak?

558
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,320
Your star and the Crown Prince's star
are in perfect alignment.

559
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,610
If the 4th Prince stays in Songak,
it is a sign of great fortune in Goryeo.

560
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,900
Tell the Kangs in Shinju
and all of Songak of this news.

561
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:20,200
From this day forth, the 4th Prince,
Wang So, will be staying in Songak.

562
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,460
Thank you for your benevolence.

563
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,710
Thank you for your benevolence,
Your Majesty.

564
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,260
Do you have no appetite?

565
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,390
Do not worry about me.
You need to eat.

566
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,270
You are eating less and less.
It is worrisome.

567
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,700
<i>Myung Hee, it's Soo.</i>

568
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,670
Come in.

569
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,880
I called you here to come eat with us.

570
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,150
I can just eat in my room.

571
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:32,650
You've been sitting in your room
all day and barely eating.

572
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,240
I thought it might be better
if we ate together.

573
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,350
Sit down.

574
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,740
I know it was for the 14th Prince,
but it was dangerous to go alone.

575
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,580
You don't know what could've happened
if our prince hadn't come.

576
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,110
Yes.

577
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:02,190
Thank you for saving me.

578
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,340
I only did what I should.

579
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,510
You're getting into trouble because
you're always out and about.

580
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,400
You have no interest
in household affairs.

581
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,600
What about sewing or... knitting cotton?

582
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,290
I'll look for something to interest me.

583
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,240
I'll get going first.

584
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,400
I have some books to read.

585
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:01,970
Are you destroying it again?

586
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,310
I'm not destroying it. I'm building it.

587
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,160
What a surprise...

588
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,100
What did you wish for?

589
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,220
Do you need to know people's wishes now?

590
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,310
I'm leaving this house now.

591
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,730
I'm going to live in the palace.

592
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,030
I won't be running into you so often.

593
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,650
Oh.

594
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,160
Oh, I guess I won't have to
deliver rice to you anymore.

595
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,420
That's great.

596
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,930
You didn't do it that often.
Stop trying to take credit.

597
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:52,000
Please lead a quiet life in the palace.

598
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,860
Don't threaten to kill or not kill
people all the time.

599
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,570
Don't glare at people like you do
when they don't listen to you.

600
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:05,380
Be especially careful not to
draw your sword over nothing.

601
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,760
Oh yeah.

602
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,450
Don't destroy something that
someone worked really hard to make.

603
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,590
- What else is there?
- That's enough.

604
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,900
Eat your meals properly.

605
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,460
Sleep well, too.

606
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:21,450
Try not to have bad dreams if you can.

607
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,080
What is it?

608
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

609
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,270
Oh...

610
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,280
I just remembered you said
you weren't scared of me.

611
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,230
How can you not be scared of me?

612
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,610
I'm most scared of myself.

613
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,160
Not you, Your Highness.

614
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,390
Even though they're my feelings,
I can't figure out where they're headed.

615
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,990
No matter how much I try to
change direction...

616
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,380
it's not working.

617
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,670
They wouldn't worry
about things like this.

618
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,650
Now that I'm in Goryeo,
there are a lot of stars here.

619
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,260
What do you mean there are
a lot in Goryeo?

620
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,490
You don't believe you can
only see stars in Goryeo, do you?

621
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,130
Ji Mong would pass out if he knew.

622
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,930
It's snowing.

623
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,260
It's pretty.

627
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,830
<i>I feel the same way.</i>

<i>Rather than a woman of high value,
I want one who will treasure me.</i>
