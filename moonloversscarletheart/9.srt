00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,319
<font color="yellow">It's raining!</font>

5
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,000
<font color="yellow">It's raining!</font>

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,760
<font color="yellow">It's raining! It's rain!</font>

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,640
<font color="yellow">The heavens have answered us!</font>

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,599
<font color="yellow">It is finally raining.</font>

9
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,159
<font color="yellow">It is raining!</font>

10
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,200
<font color="yellow">It is finally raining!</font>

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,599
<font color="yellow">Rain!</font>

12
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,760
<font color="yellow">Gwangjong.</font>

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,759
<font color="yellow">A hero is born. A hero.</font>

14
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,719
<font color="yellow">How did he hide that scar anyway?</font>

15
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
<font color="yellow">I think he used cosmetics.</font>

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,520
<font color="yellow">I don't know who did it,<br>but she is very skilled.</font>

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,159
<font color="yellow">The heavens chose our<br>fourth brother for a reason.</font>

18
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,680
<font color="yellow">You must not treat So carelessly anymore.</font>

19
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,199
<font color="yellow">It was the 4th Prince.</font>

20
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,560
<font color="yellow">Prince Wang So is Gwangjong.</font>

21
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,599
<font color="yellow">His brothers, nephews,<br>and longtime subjects...</font>

22
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,639
<font color="yellow">they say he killed them all.</font>

23
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,479
<font color="yellow">He's that Gwangjong.</font>

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,319
<font color="yellow">He killed them?</font>

25
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,000
<font color="yellow">Your Highness, you have saved us!</font>

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,120
<font color="yellow">You are our savior!</font>

27
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,479
<font color="yellow">You have saved us all!</font>

28
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,719
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

29
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,199
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

30
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,319
<font color="yellow">Is he going to become<br>a king because of me?</font>

31
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,759
<font color="yellow">Because I covered his scar?</font>

32
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,399
<font color="yellow">No, his name was already<br>recorded in history.</font>

33
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,879
<font color="yellow">Even if I hadn't done it,<br>he would've become a king.</font>

34
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,959
<font color="yellow">But is Prince Wang So really going to...</font>

35
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,839
<font color="yellow">Soo, it's raining now.</font>

36
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,800
<font color="yellow">The king will celebrate this rain.</font>

37
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,160
<font color="yellow">Soo, what is it?</font>

38
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,800
<font color="yellow">Will they all die because of me?</font>

39
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,439
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

40
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,720
<font color="yellow">That person...</font>

41
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,000
<font color="yellow">is he becoming like that<br>because of me?</font>

42
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
<font color="yellow">Is he?</font>

43
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,759
<font color="yellow">You have to be safe, Your Highness.</font>

44
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,839
<font color="yellow">The 4th Prince was chosen by the heavens.</font>

45
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,439
<font color="yellow">There is no way the heavens chose him.</font>

46
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,600
<font color="yellow">It should have been me.</font>

47
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,680
<font color="yellow">That was my seat.</font>

48
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,360
<font color="yellow">I should have brought the rain!</font>

49
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,120
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

50
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,319
<font color="yellow">How could you lose<br>an opportunity like that?</font>

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,879
<font color="yellow">If someone tries to take what is yours</font>

52
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,560
<font color="yellow">you must tear his throat out<br>to protect it if you must!</font>

53
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,680
<font color="yellow">You should have taken it,<br>no matter what!</font>

54
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,800
<font color="yellow">A mistake... it was a mistake.</font>

55
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,199
<font color="yellow">- I can make mistakes too!<br>- No.</font>

56
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,279
<font color="yellow">There are no mistakes.</font>

57
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,680
<font color="yellow">If I am to rise up as a king's mother,<br>you must be persistent and ruthless.</font>

58
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,120
<font color="yellow">Court Lady Hae from the Damiwon...</font>

59
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,199
<font color="yellow">I am positive she covered up<br>So's scar with the use of makeup.</font>

60
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,079
<font color="yellow">I am to raise you up, Mother?</font>

61
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,399
<font color="yellow">Damiwon, Damiwon, Damiwon!</font>

62
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,759
<font color="yellow">The girls at Damiwon are all troublesome.</font>

63
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,319
<font color="yellow">I will burn that place down.</font>

64
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,240
<font color="yellow">The 4th Prince So is here<br>to see His Majesty.</font>

65
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,160
<font color="yellow">Prince Wang So,<br>you have accomplished a great feat.</font>

66
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,439
<font color="yellow">You have saved this country.</font>

67
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,240
<font color="yellow">I only led the rain ritual<br>in place of the Crown Prince.</font>

68
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,519
<font color="yellow">Why is that important?</font>

69
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,600
<font color="yellow">I was delayed by a pack of thieves.<br>I could not make it to the ritual.</font>

70
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,319
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Your Majesty.</font>

71
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,600
<font color="yellow">How many years has it been since you've<br>shown your face to your father?</font>

72
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,839
<font color="yellow">You have kept that scar to yourself<br>for so many years.</font>

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
<font color="yellow">I have caused you to worry.</font>

74
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,000
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

75
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,839
<font color="yellow">Show your bare face to the world now<br>and be confident.</font>

76
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,840
<font color="yellow">Devote yourself to helping the<br>Crown Prince make a good nation.</font>

77
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,639
<font color="yellow">You must become<br>a great source of strength.</font>

78
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,759
<font color="yellow">Your father trusts you.</font>

79
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,360
<font color="yellow">I accept your orders.</font>

80
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,120
<font color="yellow">We can avoid the rain here for now.<br>Someone will bring us rain clothes soon.</font>

81
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,919
<font color="yellow">Was it you who covered So's scar?</font>

82
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,720
<font color="yellow">You can get into trouble for<br>touching the face of a prince.</font>

83
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,399
<font color="yellow">You did a good thing.<br>You do not need to worry.</font>

84
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,120
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

85
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,759
<font color="yellow">So may have stood in place of the<br>Crown Prince at the rain ritual.</font>

86
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,720
<font color="yellow">But that does not change anything.</font>

87
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

88
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,759
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

89
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,480
<font color="yellow">But things have to change.</font>

90
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,200
<font color="yellow">Are they not going to change?</font>

91
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,840
<font color="yellow">Now that the rain has fallen,<br>the king will celebrate.</font>

92
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,120
<font color="yellow">It has been a long time since a court<br>lady has been released from service.</font>

93
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,840
<font color="yellow">I'm certain that is what it will be.</font>

94
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,480
<font color="yellow">I can't just do nothing.</font>

95
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,519
<font color="yellow">- I need to find out.<br>- Soo.</font>

96
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,559
<font color="yellow">Do you know who the next king will be?</font>

97
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,159
<font color="yellow">I suppose it will be the Crown Prince<br>as long as nothing happens.</font>

98
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,639
<font color="yellow">Then... what about<br>after the Crown Prince?</font>

99
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,639
<font color="yellow">After him?</font>

100
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,159
<font color="yellow">Gwangjong... that's what you said.</font>

101
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,240
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

102
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,320
<font color="yellow">You called Prince Wang So "Gwangjong".</font>

103
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,720
<font color="yellow">I said that without realizing it.</font>

104
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,799
<font color="yellow">It just came out.</font>

105
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,840
<font color="yellow">I think I must have been<br>about four or five.</font>

106
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,480
<font color="yellow">They say I nearly drowned to death.</font>

107
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,000
<font color="yellow">No! They say that I did die.</font>

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,159
<font color="yellow">But I woke up after a day.</font>

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,440
<font color="yellow">You died... and came back to life?</font>

110
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,919
<font color="yellow">My mother would often say to me</font>

111
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,559
<font color="yellow">that once I came back to life,<br>I seemed completely different.</font>

112
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,240
<font color="yellow">She said I seemed wise beyond my years.</font>

113
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,240
<font color="yellow">I've never told anyone about this.</font>

114
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,759
<font color="yellow">Often, I see scenes pass before my eyes</font>

115
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,519
<font color="yellow">and I don't know if<br>they're real or dreams.</font>

116
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,679
<font color="yellow">I see a big bird that<br>carries people in the sky.</font>

117
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,240
<font color="yellow">I've even seen stairs and<br>a room that moves on its own.</font>

118
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
<font color="yellow">I saw a building as high as the sky<br>filled with many, many people.</font>

119
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,159
<font color="yellow">Is this person from the future like me?</font>

120
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,960
<font color="yellow">Maybe he can't remember<br>because he was too young.</font>

121
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,720
<font color="yellow">I heard that you also died and came back.</font>

122
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,120
<font color="yellow">So I wondered if you had<br>the gift of foresight like I do.</font>

123
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,279
<font color="yellow">Now ask me the question<br>you truly want to.</font>

124
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,840
<font color="yellow">What is it that you really<br>want to know, Lady Soo?</font>

125
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,679
<font color="yellow">Is Prince So really Gwangjong?<br>Is he going to kill everyone?</font>

126
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,360
<font color="yellow">What about Prince Wang Wook?<br>What is his future like?</font>

127
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,039
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

128
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,679
<font color="yellow">should I do?</font>

129
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,840
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

130
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,440
<font color="yellow">You mustn't do anything.</font>

131
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,360
<font color="yellow">Whatever it is you saw,<br>let things flow naturally.</font>

132
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,840
<font color="yellow">You cannot get involved.</font>

133
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,399
<font color="yellow">What if I can change things?</font>

134
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,679
<font color="yellow">I can stop trouble from occurring.</font>

135
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,519
<font color="yellow">I can make something bad<br>into something good.</font>

136
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,240
<font color="yellow">You have already laid your hands<br>on Prince Wang So's face.</font>

137
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,600
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

138
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
<font color="yellow">the prince's future...</font>

139
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,360
<font color="yellow">will it change?</font>

140
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
<font color="yellow">I do not know that.</font>

141
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,840
<font color="yellow">The moment humans realize heaven's will,<br>that is called fate.</font>

142
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,600
<font color="yellow">Did it change<br>or was it always meant to be?</font>

143
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,639
<font color="yellow">Who knows these things?</font>

144
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,799
<font color="yellow">We humans cannot escape<br>the will of the heavens.</font>

145
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,000
<font color="yellow">Leave things to play out<br>the way they are meant to be.</font>

146
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,600
<font color="yellow">That is what will keep you safe.</font>

147
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,320
<font color="yellow">So has made it rain.</font>

148
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,120
<font color="yellow">Now he will receive the King's trust.</font>

149
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,399
<font color="yellow">Yes, he will.</font>

150
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,360
<font color="yellow">If the Crown Prince was not<br>going to be the master of the ritual</font>

151
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,919
<font color="yellow">you should have been<br>the one standing there.</font>

152
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,639
<font color="yellow">It was a good opportunity.</font>

153
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,159
<font color="yellow">It was a seat that was given to So.</font>

154
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,720
<font color="yellow">It was necessary for So<br>to be in that seat.</font>

155
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,759
<font color="yellow">I should not be greedy<br>for something like that.</font>

156
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,720
<font color="yellow">Once you receive the favor of the king</font>

157
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,799
<font color="yellow">it is easy to get<br>other ideas in your head.</font>

158
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,279
<font color="yellow">I am only saying that we have another<br>person to be wary of in the palace.</font>

159
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,960
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo said So would be different too.</font>

160
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,399
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that, as well?</font>

161
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,720
<font color="yellow">As for So...</font>

162
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,279
<font color="yellow">why shouldn't he receive<br>the king's trust and confidence?</font>

163
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,159
<font color="yellow">Think about the harsh treatment<br>he has received all this time.</font>

164
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,080
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo warned you to<br>be careful of our 4th brother?</font>

165
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

166
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,440
<font color="yellow">The person who helped So<br>take off his mask was...</font>

167
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,480
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo.</font>

168
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,759
<font color="yellow">She is afraid that something<br>will happen because of that.</font>

169
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,919
<font color="yellow">As for me...</font>

170
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,480
<font color="yellow">there must be a seat that<br>is necessary for me to fill.</font>

171
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,840
<font color="yellow">What could it be?</font>

172
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,120
<font color="yellow">I am very...</font>

173
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,840
<font color="yellow">curious.</font>

174
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,039
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

175
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,799
<font color="yellow">It was so sudden.</font>

176
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,279
<font color="yellow">You came at me so suddenly.</font>

177
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,039
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean anything by it.</font>

178
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,039
<font color="yellow">I was just so surprised, really.</font>

179
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

180
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,120
<font color="yellow">Did I say anything about it?</font>

181
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
<font color="yellow">You don't need to be sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

182
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,319
<font color="yellow">For the first time in my life,<br>I called the king "Father."</font>

183
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,680
<font color="yellow">It had been 15 years since he looked<br>at my face and my eyes properly.</font>

184
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,160
<font color="yellow">He told me to be more confident.</font>

185
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,559
<font color="yellow">After I heard those words,<br>all the pain I had just disappeared.</font>

186
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,240
<font color="yellow">I'll have to be a great support<br>to the Crown Prince, like he said.</font>

187
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,599
<font color="yellow">Everyone keeps thanking me.</font>

188
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,359
<font color="yellow">No one says I'm scary<br>or calls me a beast.</font>

189
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,640
<font color="yellow">It's funny.</font>

190
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,200
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to like myself this way.</font>

191
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

192
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,400
<font color="yellow">the person who made this way...</font>

193
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,839
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo, it was you.</font>

194
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,640
<font color="yellow">A person like this is going to<br>become that cruel?</font>

195
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,039
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

196
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,559
<font color="yellow">Choi Ji Mong said I should<br>never get involved.</font>

197
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,000
<font color="yellow">I could help him and<br>change Gwangjong's future.</font>

198
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,519
<font color="yellow">No matter how angry you get,<br>you must hold it in.</font>

199
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,000
<font color="yellow">Don't ever kill anyone.</font>

200
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,640
<font color="yellow">You won't have any reason<br>to be hurt in the future.</font>

201
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
<font color="yellow">Everyone will like you and treat you<br>as a precious person, okay?</font>

202
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you and your lectures.</font>

203
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,599
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

204
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,160
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

205
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,200
<font color="yellow">I won't ignore it.</font>

206
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,880
<font color="yellow">I won't let anyone get hurt.</font>

207
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,319
<font color="yellow">Lady Mong Ryang Won asked me<br>to find a suitable match for Soon Deok.</font>

208
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,359
<font color="yellow">So, I'm thinking of choosing<br>one of the princes.</font>

209
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,240
<font color="yellow">One of the princes?</font>

210
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,279
<font color="yellow">The 14th Prince would be a<br>suitable match for Lady Soon Deok.</font>

211
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,680
<font color="yellow">They both love the martial arts and<br>their horoscopes are a good fit.</font>

212
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,000
<font color="yellow">Come now. What if husband<br>and wife got into a fight?</font>

213
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,960
<font color="yellow">The two of them would<br>tear the house down.</font>

214
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,200
<font color="yellow">Then how about the 13th Prince, Baek Ah?</font>

215
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,400
<font color="yellow">He is Songak's best looking man.</font>

216
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,240
<font color="yellow">She will be the envy of<br>all the girls in Goryeo.</font>

217
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
<font color="yellow">She might be stoned to death<br>by them all. I don't think so.</font>

218
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,000
<font color="yellow">The 4th Prince.</font>

219
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,079
<font color="yellow">I don't know about the others.</font>

220
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,359
<font color="yellow">However, they once learned<br>martial arts together</font>

221
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,839
<font color="yellow">so there must be affection there.</font>

222
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,200
<font color="yellow">One was busy killing bears and<br>the other was busy killing wolves.</font>

223
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,799
<font color="yellow">They have never even met before.</font>

224
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,039
<font color="yellow">If you don't like any of them,<br>then what shall we do?</font>

225
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,680
<font color="yellow">Ah... the 8th Prince.</font>

226
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,160
<font color="yellow">He should remarry, but his disposition<br>is so different from Lady Soon Deok.</font>

227
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,920
<font color="yellow">Hey! You should count properly.<br>Why are you skipping over people?</font>

228
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,480
<font color="yellow">Look... you forgot one.</font>

229
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,599
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

230
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,640
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

231
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,599
<font color="yellow">Oh, do you really mean it?</font>

232
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,240
<font color="yellow">Soo, I have something for you.<br>See me later.</font>

233
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,359
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

234
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
<font color="yellow">His Majesty, the king, is entering.</font>

235
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,759
<font color="yellow">Hello, Your Majesty.</font>

236
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,759
<font color="yellow">You've all been working hard.</font>

237
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,759
<font color="yellow">Especially you, 4th Prince.</font>

238
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,240
<font color="yellow">You relieved us from the drought<br>and I want to reward you.</font>

239
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you want?</font>

240
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,200
<font color="yellow">I thought of giving you Songak land<br>to build a home and some farmland.</font>

241
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,279
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Your Majesty, but there is<br>something I want more than land.</font>

242
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,960
<font color="yellow">All right, tell me.</font>

243
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,039
<font color="yellow">Please give me Damiwon's<br>Court Lady Hae Soo.</font>

244
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,119
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

245
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,160
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

246
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,920
<font color="yellow">I suppose it would be good<br>to keep her close by to help you.</font>

247
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,039
<font color="yellow">In recognition of your efforts</font>

248
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,480
<font color="yellow">Damiwon's Hae Soo will promoted<br>to Senior Court Lady.</font>

249
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,599
<font color="yellow">From now on, you must<br>actively assist the 4th Prince.</font>

250
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

251
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,200
<font color="yellow">I will accept your command.</font>

252
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,599
<font color="yellow">To celebrate the rain,<br>we will have a prince's marriage.</font>

253
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,480
<font color="yellow">We will set a date soon.</font>

254
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,400
<font color="yellow">It will be the Grand General's<br>daughter, Soon Deok</font>

255
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,960
<font color="yellow">and the 10th Prince, Eun,<br>who will be getting married.</font>

256
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,559
<font color="yellow">Eun, you are getting married!<br>Congratulations.</font>

257
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,400
<font color="yellow">I do not want to get married.</font>

258
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,480
<font color="yellow">Are you shy?</font>

259
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,839
<font color="yellow">You should have in-laws and<br>do your part as a royal family member.</font>

260
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,160
<font color="yellow">There's still our fourth brother,<br>and our eighth brother is single again.</font>

261
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,559
<font color="yellow">I'm still very young.</font>

262
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,200
<font color="yellow">And that Park girl...</font>

263
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,200
<font color="yellow">I just don't like it!<br>I refuse... I refuse to get married.</font>

264
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,759
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty, please withdraw your words.</font>

265
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,680
<font color="yellow">I really do not want this.</font>

266
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,240
<font color="yellow">If you insist on this marriage...</font>

267
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,480
<font color="yellow">I would rather die.</font>

268
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,559
<font color="yellow">Instead than do what I ask,<br>you would rather die?</font>

269
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,680
<font color="yellow">You would rather dishonor<br>your father and die instead?</font>

270
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,839
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty, he must be so excited<br>that he does not know what he is saying.</font>

271
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,920
<font color="yellow">Eun, go on and thank the king.  Go on.</font>

272
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,519
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your great benevolence.</font>

273
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,440
<font color="yellow">Eun, women are only different<br>on the first night.</font>

274
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,680
<font color="yellow">After that, all women are the same.</font>

275
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,240
<font color="yellow">I even get the names of my first<br>and second wife confused sometimes.</font>

276
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,599
<font color="yellow">I do not want to live like you.</font>

277
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,720
<font color="yellow">Oh, wait!</font>

278
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,039
<font color="yellow">It's better not to see.</font>

279
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,839
<font color="yellow">I feel down so I want to see.</font>

280
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,599
<font color="yellow">I think it's better not to.</font>

281
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,799
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

282
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,759
<font color="yellow">Go! You got it!</font>

283
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,599
<font color="yellow">Great soldier, great soldier,<br>great soldier!</font>

284
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,400
<font color="yellow">Eun, Eun.</font>

285
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,960
<font color="yellow">She's really amazing.</font>

286
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,160
<font color="yellow">Sister-in-law can beat any man.</font>

287
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,799
<font color="yellow">She really is a great soldier.</font>

288
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,599
<font color="yellow">Eun, I envy you.</font>

289
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,599
<font color="yellow">She's a great soldier... a soldier.</font>

290
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:31,160
<font color="yellow">I'm marrying a great soldier.</font>

291
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,200
<font color="yellow">Great soldier, great soldier,<br>great soldier!</font>

292
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,759
<font color="yellow">A great soldier?</font>

293
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,240
<font color="yellow">Great soldier, great soldier,<br>great soldier, great soldier!</font>

294
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,240
<font color="yellow">I was only practicing a sword dance.</font>

295
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,480
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be afraid.<br>I won't hurt you.</font>

296
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,519
<font color="yellow">Here are some treats.</font>

297
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,119
<font color="yellow">- Me too.<br>- Me too!</font>

298
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,720
<font color="yellow">Eat it slowly.</font>

299
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,279
<font color="yellow">- Yes.<br>- Share.</font>

300
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,200
<font color="yellow">- Get going.<br>- Thank you.</font>

301
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,799
<font color="yellow">I saw you before, right?</font>

302
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,880
<font color="yellow">From Hubaekje?</font>

303
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,480
<font color="yellow">You should pay for<br>the drawings you ripped.</font>

304
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,799
<font color="yellow">If you have nothing to give me,<br>you could show me your sword dance.</font>

305
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,480
<font color="yellow">I saw you before, right?</font>

306
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,839
<font color="yellow">That money insect.</font>

307
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,839
<font color="yellow">Money insect?</font>

308
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,559
<font color="yellow">Drawings and instruments.</font>

309
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,640
<font color="yellow">You work hard to please the nobles.</font>

310
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,480
<font color="yellow">You're diligent.</font>

311
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,240
<font color="yellow">You came because of my music, right?</font>

312
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,839
<font color="yellow">Anyone in Songak who dances can't help<br>but move once my music starts.</font>

313
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,720
<font color="yellow">Let me see you dance.</font>

314
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,440
<font color="yellow">You never know.<br>I might play my great music.</font>

315
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,519
<font color="yellow">I don't dance for strange men.</font>

316
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,880
<font color="yellow">You're very picky.</font>

317
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,480
<font color="yellow">Then, we can introduce ourselves.</font>

318
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,839
<font color="yellow">I'm Baek Ah. How about you?</font>

319
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,039
<font color="yellow">Baek Ah?</font>

320
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,079
<font color="yellow">If you are Baek Ah,<br>I am one of your attendants.</font>

321
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,519
<font color="yellow">You don't have any honesty<br>in you at all.</font>

322
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,160
<font color="yellow">It's a waste of your talents,<br>so don't live that way.</font>

323
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,720
<font color="yellow">I really am Baek Ah.</font>

324
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,480
<font color="yellow">Ah, you must not know because<br>you haven't been in Songak very long.</font>

325
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,400
<font color="yellow">I'm the 13th...</font>

326
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,960
<font color="yellow">She disappeared again.</font>

327
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,799
<font color="yellow">This thing... it's unique like its owner.</font>

328
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,680
<font color="yellow">She called me an insect.</font>

329
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,559
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't live my life this way?</font>

330
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,359
<font color="yellow">I've only met you twice,<br>but you are so nosy about my life.</font>

331
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,559
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

332
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,680
<font color="yellow">I guess it's for the bracelet you got me.</font>

333
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,640
<font color="yellow">Or to celebrate me leaving the palace.</font>

334
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,920
<font color="yellow">Myung Hee said that you<br>always had many worries.</font>

335
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,680
<font color="yellow">She said I should make you that<br>so that you could sleep well.</font>

336
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,839
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

337
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,119
<font color="yellow">I have something for you too.</font>

338
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,799
<font color="yellow">It's a book.</font>

339
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,759
<font color="yellow">I'll study very hard.</font>

340
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,240
<font color="yellow">Look at it closely.</font>

341
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,599
<font color="yellow">I know this.</font>

342
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,039
<font color="yellow">I used to do this with my friends.</font>

343
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,599
<font color="yellow">Did you draw this yourself?</font>

344
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,799
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

345
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,839
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

346
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,559
<font color="yellow">Eun is getting married.</font>

347
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,880
<font color="yellow">So, this time around...</font>

348
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:44,599
<font color="yellow">a court lady will not be released<br>to celebrate the rain.</font>

349
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,559
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we will get another chance.</font>

350
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,359
<font color="yellow">I am Court Lady Oh's right hand woman.</font>

351
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:02,079
<font color="yellow">I was actually worried about<br>how she'd get by without me.</font>

352
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,519
<font color="yellow">I got promoted too.</font>

353
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,360
<font color="yellow">I do not know when<br>another chance will come.</font>

354
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,800
<font color="yellow">If you are willing to wait, Your Highness</font>

355
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,239
<font color="yellow">I can wait.</font>

356
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,960
<font color="yellow">You know, I think I've<br>seen this somewhere.</font>

357
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,039
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to say that I was worried.</font>

358
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,519
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked you to wait.</font>

359
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,800
<font color="yellow">Because I felt like<br>something would go wrong.</font>

360
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,880
<font color="yellow">When it snows again...<br>let's walk here.</font>

361
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,800
<font color="yellow">Just the two of us.</font>

362
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,440
<font color="yellow">I will wait.</font>

363
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,320
<font color="yellow">I... love you.</font>

364
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,360
<font color="yellow">The king prefers wild plant teas<br>over leaf teas.</font>

365
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,320
<font color="yellow">You need to pay attention to details.</font>

366
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:06,400
<font color="yellow">He's had headaches and<br>his eyesight is not good.</font>

367
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,079
<font color="yellow">He eats cassia seeds and<br>Chinese matrimony vine fruit often.</font>

368
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,280
<font color="yellow">He often gets thirsty<br>and wakes up in the night.</font>

369
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,400
<font color="yellow">It is good to give him<br>herbal medicine for that.</font>

370
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,519
<font color="yellow">Yes, Court Lady Oh.</font>

371
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:22,039
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Prince Wang So.</font>

372
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,639
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

373
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,320
<font color="yellow">You tried to care for him and<br>now he learned how to care from you.</font>

374
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:30,760
<font color="yellow">If you cannot give him your whole heart,<br>you need to make that clear.</font>

375
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,320
<font color="yellow">What if...<br>I can change that person's life?</font>

376
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
<font color="yellow">Should I still turn my back on him?</font>

377
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,960
<font color="yellow">Before I came into the palace,<br>I gave my heart to a man.</font>

378
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,840
<font color="yellow">He was an unknown commander who<br>would pick flowers and herbs with me.</font>

379
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,880
<font color="yellow">I thought he would forget his ambitions<br>and live a normal life with me.</font>

380
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
<font color="yellow">In the end, he rose to a place<br>where I couldn't dare to touch him.</font>

381
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,719
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

382
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,239
<font color="yellow">People do not change for others.</font>

383
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,599
<font color="yellow">So you need to throw out the belief<br>that you can change a person.</font>

384
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,519
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

385
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,960
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

386
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,880
<font color="yellow">You're Hae Soo, aren't you?<br>We must go to the 10th Prince now.</font>

387
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,960
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

388
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can<br>get through to the prince.</font>

389
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid something might happen to him.</font>

390
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,639
<font color="yellow">You have to go to him.</font>

391
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know what this is about,<br>but I shouldn't get involved.</font>

392
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,519
<font color="yellow">You can even be his second wife!</font>

393
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,000
<font color="yellow">As long as you serve the prince well...</font>

394
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,440
<font color="yellow">I am fine with it.</font>

395
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,280
<font color="yellow">I will speak to the king<br>and my father about it.</font>

396
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,119
<font color="yellow">Should I really do this?</font>

397
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:24,440
<font color="yellow">Eun will die if he does not go.</font>

398
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,880
<font color="yellow">Do it if you want to save his life.</font>

399
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,360
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

400
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,960
<font color="yellow">It's me, Hae Soo.</font>

401
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,920
<font color="yellow">Open the door now.</font>

402
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,440
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be doing this. Go now.</font>

403
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,239
<font color="yellow">Open this door now!</font>

404
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,440
<font color="yellow">I won't ever speak to you again<br>if you don't open it.</font>

405
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
<font color="yellow">Does it change anything to get drunk?</font>

406
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,960
<font color="yellow">If you get drunk,<br>does that mean you don't have to marry?</font>

407
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,199
<font color="yellow">You do not know I feel.</font>

408
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,559
<font color="yellow">You like me, but now you must<br>marry someone you don't like.</font>

409
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,960
<font color="yellow">You knew? But why...</font>

410
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,760
<font color="yellow">Then... then Soo...</font>

411
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,920
<font color="yellow">Will you be my second wife?</font>

412
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:13,679
<font color="yellow">The king and my brothers have many wives.</font>

413
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,760
<font color="yellow">It is not a bad thing.</font>

414
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,719
<font color="yellow">Even if you are not the first wife,<br>I will only be good to you.</font>

415
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,920
<font color="yellow">- So, Soo--<br>- No.</font>

416
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,679
<font color="yellow">I cannot live that way.</font>

417
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:31,079
<font color="yellow">I can't share my husband<br>with several women.</font>

418
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:35,800
<font color="yellow">I don't want to grow old while<br>waiting for him to come to me.</font>

419
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,159
<font color="yellow">Liar.</font>

420
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,679
<font color="yellow">Even if I had asked you<br>to be my first wife</font>

421
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,599
<font color="yellow">you would have said no.</font>

422
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,440
<font color="yellow">I'm stupid. I know that.</font>

423
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,639
<font color="yellow">While my brothers finish reading 10 books</font>

424
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,199
<font color="yellow">I only manage to finish one.</font>

425
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:19,519
<font color="yellow">Even when my father speaks<br>or the teacher instructs us...</font>

426
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,760
<font color="yellow">I never understand right away.</font>

427
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,199
<font color="yellow">I have always been stupid.</font>

428
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,480
<font color="yellow">That is probably why you don't like me.</font>

429
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,840
<font color="yellow">I was happiest while I was with you,<br>Your Highness.</font>

430
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,119
<font color="yellow">You laugh when you're happy<br>and you know to cry when you're sad.</font>

431
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,320
<font color="yellow">So I never felt anxious with you,<br>Your Highness.</font>

432
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,440
<font color="yellow">I was able to laugh, cry,<br>and get angry to my heart's content.</font>

433
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,320
<font color="yellow">I do not want that kind of consolation.</font>

434
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,280
<font color="yellow">You are a mean girl.</font>

435
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,920
<font color="yellow">I knew from the beginning.</font>

436
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:09,960
<font color="yellow">You would never become mine.</font>

437
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:22,519
<font color="yellow">If I said that I was sorry,<br>that would be truly mean, right?</font>

438
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,159
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

439
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,360
<font color="yellow">I am not going to apologize.</font>

440
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,480
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

441
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,639
<font color="yellow">ever even like me?</font>

442
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,920
<font color="yellow">I still like you very much now.</font>

443
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,320
<font color="yellow">Please be happy.</font>

444
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,760
<font color="yellow">Oh, Eun! Grab him!</font>

445
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,039
<font color="yellow">There's no need for that.</font>

446
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,800
<font color="yellow">I will go there on my own.</font>

447
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,400
<font color="yellow">Aren't we getting married?</font>

448
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,000
<font color="yellow">We have to hurry! We'll be late.</font>

449
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,440
<font color="yellow">I have prepared five rolls of fine<br>cloth and fabric for you, Sister-in-law.</font>

450
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,320
<font color="yellow">Please make my brother happy<br>with some good clothes.</font>

451
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,760
<font color="yellow">These are pearls.<br>I hope you are blessed with children.</font>

452
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,159
<font color="yellow">Use this bronze mirror and<br>live a pure married life, Eun.</font>

453
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:09,960
<font color="yellow">This is silver, Eun.</font>

454
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:16,559
<font color="yellow">"Hyun Hyun Yeok Saek."</font>

455
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,480
<font color="yellow">It means that the kindness of heart<br>is what's important in a marriage</font>

456
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,840
<font color="yellow">not the appearance.</font>

457
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,199
<font color="yellow">Therefore, all of this is an added bonus.</font>

458
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,840
<font color="yellow">I will use them all well.</font>

459
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,039
<font color="yellow">Our 10th brother has married well.</font>

460
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:32,840
<font color="yellow">That cold girl. Is she that happy?</font>

461
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,719
<font color="yellow">If she smiles any wider,<br>her mouth will tear apart.</font>

462
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,559
<font color="yellow">I have sent a tree that blooms flowers<br>and bears fruits to your home.</font>

463
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,679
<font color="yellow">You can enjoy its shade in the<br>summer and enjoy its fruit in the fall.</font>

464
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,679
<font color="yellow">Once it grows leaves,<br>I will invite you all over.</font>

465
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:54,000
<font color="yellow">It would be perfect to<br>wrestle in the shade.</font>

466
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,719
<font color="yellow">Why would you wrestle a bride?</font>

467
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,280
<font color="yellow">You want to lose to me again?</font>

468
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,639
<font color="yellow">You should do it! Wrestle! Try it.</font>

469
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,119
<font color="yellow">Soo!</font>

470
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,039
<font color="yellow">Are you all right? Soo!</font>

471
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:55,719
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Prince Wang So.</font>

472
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:00,880
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Prince Wang So.</font>

473
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,280
<font color="yellow">Avoid him.</font>

474
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,840
<font color="yellow">You cannot try to stop him.<br>If you do...</font>

475
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:08,599
<font color="yellow">You will all die if you do.</font>

476
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,000
<font color="yellow">Look at me. Look at me, Soo.</font>

477
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,920
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?<br>What do you mean we'll die?</font>

478
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,760
<font color="yellow">I want to leave this place.</font>

479
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,639
<font color="yellow">I want to go far away from the palace,<br>wherever that is.</font>

480
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:34,800
<font color="yellow">All right, let's do that.</font>

481
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,400
<font color="yellow">I'll do that for you.</font>

482
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,840
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Soo. Calm down.</font>

483
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,440
<font color="yellow">You'll  be all right, Soo.</font>

484
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,960
<font color="yellow">The reason I asked to see you two<br>was to assign new tasks to you.</font>

485
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,280
<font color="yellow">3rd Prince Yo,<br>I need you to leave Songak.</font>

486
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,039
<font color="yellow">Visit every region and<br>inspect the grain storehouses.</font>

487
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,159
<font color="yellow">There are many of the storehouses.</font>

488
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,800
<font color="yellow">I know there are many thieves<br>that are attacking them.</font>

489
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,039
<font color="yellow">Last year, the general in charge of<br>the storehouses came back dead.</font>

490
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,199
<font color="yellow">That is why I am sending you.</font>

491
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,719
<font color="yellow">A prince must step forward<br>in order for things to change.</font>

492
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,000
<font color="yellow">Keep your group small.</font>

493
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,880
<font color="yellow">I will accept your command.</font>

494
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,079
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty, what about the military<br>supplies the 3rd Prince was in charge of?</font>

495
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,760
<font color="yellow">I will put 4th Prince So in charge of it.</font>

496
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,880
<font color="yellow">I accept your orders, Your Majesty.</font>

497
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:01,760
<font color="yellow">Is the king throwing me away?</font>

498
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,599
<font color="yellow">What? I doubt that.</font>

499
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,000
<font color="yellow">He would assign a hard task<br>to a person he trusts more.</font>

500
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:12,920
<font color="yellow">You said something<br>when you gave my seat to So.</font>

501
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,800
<font color="yellow">Because of a father's favoritism,<br>two sons are tearing each other apart.</font>

502
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:20,559
<font color="yellow">Is this the heavens' will, as well?</font>

503
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,880
<font color="yellow">You've had greed for what belongs to<br>the Crown Prince since you were young.</font>

504
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,360
<font color="yellow">Now you must find<br>your place in the world.</font>

505
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:31,440
<font color="yellow">Then keep your eye on me.</font>

506
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,880
<font color="yellow">Watch and see where<br>my place ends up being.</font>

507
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,159
<font color="yellow">We only want to have a family meal.<br>Why is it so surprising?</font>

508
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:06,760
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Mother?</font>

509
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,280
<font color="yellow">How nice it is to see your bare face.</font>

510
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,920
<font color="yellow">You now have the king's trust.<br>I am proud of you.</font>

511
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:18,000
<font color="yellow">I have waited so long<br>for a day like this.</font>

512
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,880
<font color="yellow">Let's forget the past.</font>

513
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,039
<font color="yellow">Let us eat. Eat.</font>

514
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,239
<font color="yellow">This is my first time<br>eating with you, So.</font>

515
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,320
<font color="yellow">I was already in Shinju<br>when you were born.</font>

516
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,000
<font color="yellow">We should forget the past mistakes<br>and see each other often as brothers.</font>

517
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,199
<font color="yellow">Yes, Yo.</font>

518
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:54,840
<font color="yellow">You liked meat very much<br>when you were young.</font>

519
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:03,880
<font color="yellow">I still like it very much.</font>

520
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,440
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

521
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,920
<font color="yellow">You are taking on Yo's job.<br>You have much to learn.</font>

522
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,960
<font color="yellow">I will have to leave Songak.</font>

523
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,760
<font color="yellow">It is best to learn<br>from the Crown Prince.</font>

524
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,800
<font color="yellow">I will do that.</font>

525
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,440
<font color="yellow">Then you'll have many opportunities<br>to see the Crown Prince.</font>

526
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,840
<font color="yellow">There will be times when it<br>will be just the two of you.</font>

527
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,360
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

528
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,360
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

529
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,039
<font color="yellow">There was something you wanted from me.</font>

530
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,800
<font color="yellow">Kill the Crown Prince.</font>

531
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,039
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be the first time<br>you've killed someone for me.</font>

532
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,800
<font color="yellow">Will you do it?</font>

533
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,159
<font color="yellow">Mother, you shouldn't say<br>such things, even as a joke.</font>

534
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,480
<font color="yellow">Has there been a king who hasn't killed<br>his brothers after rising to the throne?</font>

535
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,400
<font color="yellow">If I do not become the king,<br>we are all dead.</font>

536
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,639
<font color="yellow">We have to make a move.</font>

537
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:34,920
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince is not like that.<br>He would not kill his brothers.</font>

538
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,880
<font color="yellow">Is that what you really want?</font>

539
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:46,360
<font color="yellow">I want it.</font>

540
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,239
<font color="yellow">Then... I will do it.</font>

541
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,840
<font color="yellow">After I do...</font>

542
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:56,800
<font color="yellow">I will sit on the throne.</font>

543
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,960
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

544
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,400
<font color="yellow">You want a son of yours to become king.</font>

545
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,079
<font color="yellow">It shouldn't matter if it is me.</font>

546
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:08,519
<font color="yellow">Once I am on the throne...<br>I will not harm Yo or Jung.</font>

547
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,400
<font color="yellow">Don't act like you're so great.</font>

548
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,599
<font color="yellow">If I had performed the rain ritual,<br>I would be the one who brought rain.</font>

549
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,239
<font color="yellow">You think you can eye the throne<br>over something like that?</font>

550
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,199
<font color="yellow">I have the heavens' will.</font>

551
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,599
<font color="yellow">You have nothing except your in-laws.</font>

552
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,840
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince has lowly in-laws.</font>

553
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,920
<font color="yellow">So, do you agree that<br>he should be removed?</font>

554
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,440
<font color="yellow">Your brother is blessed<br>by the heavens to become king.</font>

555
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,480
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are dealing with?</font>

556
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,559
<font color="yellow">You are all making<br>such a fuss over a joke.</font>

557
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,960
<font color="yellow">I keep getting other ideas in my head.</font>

558
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,559
<font color="yellow">King?</font>

559
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,960
<font color="yellow">That seat that everyone wants so much,<br>what if I happened to take it?</font>

560
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:01,679
<font color="yellow">You think you can do anything<br>because of a few brush strokes.</font>

561
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,760
<font color="yellow">Do you really think<br>you've become something?</font>

562
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:10,800
<font color="yellow">You were chosen for the rain ritual.</font>

563
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,440
<font color="yellow">They felt that it'd be all right<br>for you to be beaten to death</font>

564
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,639
<font color="yellow">instead of the Crown Prince.</font>

565
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,960
<font color="yellow">You were a shield for any arrows or<br>misfortune that would've come his way.</font>

566
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,679
<font color="yellow">You had no idea that your father<br>had manipulated you.</font>

567
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:25,360
<font color="yellow">I was not manipulated.</font>

568
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,119
<font color="yellow">I knew and crawled into that seat.</font>

569
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,280
<font color="yellow">The food I ate here was not so bad.</font>

570
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,239
<font color="yellow">Still, you should just eat<br>with your family.</font>

571
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,719
<font color="yellow">Do not call me in here again.</font>

572
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,119
<font color="yellow">As I thought, it is too difficult<br>to reconcile with him.</font>

573
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,079
<font color="yellow">We will need to cut ties.</font>

574
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,679
<font color="yellow">You are all too much.</font>

575
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:10,039
<font color="yellow">You ask him to murder a person<br>at a family dinner?</font>

576
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,280
<font color="yellow">If you were going to raise us as enemies</font>

577
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,920
<font color="yellow">why did you give birth to us, Mother?</font>

578
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,280
<font color="yellow">What is he saying...</font>

579
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,079
<font color="yellow">Jung!</font>

580
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,119
<font color="yellow">How foolish.</font>

581
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,239
<font color="yellow">What were you expecting?</font>

582
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,400
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Wang So?</font>

583
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,000
<font color="yellow">You cannot try to stop him...</font>

584
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,079
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Wang So.</font>

585
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,679
<font color="yellow">You cannot try to stop him.</font>

586
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:56,559
<font color="yellow">Soo.</font>

587
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,239
<font color="yellow">Please let me go.</font>

588
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:08,480
<font color="yellow">Just for a moment.</font>

589
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,960
<font color="yellow">Stay with me.</font>

590
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,199
<font color="yellow">I need to rest.</font>

591
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,159
<font color="yellow">I don't want to!</font>

592
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,039
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid of you, Your Highness.</font>

593
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,920
<font color="yellow">You said you were not afraid of me.</font>

594
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,039
<font color="yellow">I thought I could change things.</font>
