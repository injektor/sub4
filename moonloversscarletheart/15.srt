<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

156
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:14,395
<font color="yellow">The king wants me to catch a criminal who committed treason.</font>

157
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:18,365
<font color="yellow">Then the person the 4th Prince needs to catch is...</font>

158
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,975
<font color="yellow">Lady Hae? Lady?</font>

159
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:48,826
<font color="yellow">Soo, it's me.</font>

160
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:07,797
<font color="yellow">The new king won't be able to figure out we are hiding here.</font>

161
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,698
<font color="yellow">His Highness says that we can trust you.</font>

162
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,909
<font color="yellow">But don't get any other ideas.</font>

163
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,554
<font color="yellow">You're dead if you do.</font>

164
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,211
<font color="yellow">Stop it, already.</font>

165
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:25,624
<font color="yellow">Anyway, don't worry too much, Soo.</font>

166
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:29,383
<font color="yellow">We have a boat, so we'll be here until it leaves.</font>

167
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:31,236
<font color="yellow">Where will you be going?</font>

168
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,138
<font color="yellow">- We'll-- - That's enough.</font>

169
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:38,047
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know that. Just make sure we do not get caught.</font>

170
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,687
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anyone about us.</font>

171
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:43,607
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll make sure to be very careful.</font>

172
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,577
<font color="yellow">But wouldn't it be better to get help from my brothers?</font>

173
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:51,971
<font color="yellow">Yeah, like from Wook.</font>

174
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,695
<font color="yellow">What about Baek Ah or Jung?</font>

175
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:56,239
<font color="yellow">There's no way they wouldn't help me.</font>

176
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,485
<font color="yellow">- Even So was there on my birthday-- - No!</font>

177
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,367
<font color="yellow">Because...</font>

178
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:12,297
<font color="yellow">the 4th Prince is currently looking for the two of you.</font>

179
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:16,286
<font color="yellow">We can't tell anyone.</font>

180
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,728
<font color="yellow">We don't know how things can leak out.</font>

181
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:21,906
<font color="yellow">If we make one wrong move, it is all over.</font>

182
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,796
<font color="yellow">All right, I got it.</font>

183
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:27,806
<font color="yellow">By the way, Soo...</font>

184
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:32,726
<font color="yellow">What happened to my mother and aunt?</font>

185
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,545
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

186
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:40,423
<font color="yellow">I don't know much about what's going on outside the Damiwon.</font>

187
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:45,488
<font color="yellow">I'm bothered by the fact that I couldn't bring them with me.</font>

188
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,441
<font color="yellow">I hope they managed to get away.</font>

189
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:05,054
<font color="yellow">Please allow the people of Later Baekje to access the southern territories.</font>

190
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:08,349
<font color="yellow">Allow them to farm the land for three years without paying taxes.</font>

191
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:10,820
<font color="yellow">Please emancipate those who were taken forcefully as slaves.</font>

192
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,819
<font color="yellow">Restore law-abiding citizens back to their status.</font>

193
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,805
<font color="yellow">Allow them to farm the land.</font>

194
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,483
<font color="yellow">I thought you were merely a gisaeng who wanted revenge for your parents.</font>

195
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,941
<font color="yellow">You were a representative for Later Baekje.</font>

196
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:27,723
<font color="yellow">You hid a lot from me.</font>

197
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:33,075
<font color="yellow">I thought it may be used against you, Your Majesty.</font>

198
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:37,144
<font color="yellow">You were someone who tried to kill the king.</font>

199
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,172
<font color="yellow">Why would I trust you and make a deal?</font>

200
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,280
<font color="yellow">My people are starving to death.</font>

201
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,246
<font color="yellow">Revenge means nothing to me.</font>

202
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,723
<font color="yellow">If you guarantee their survival</font>

203
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:52,625
<font color="yellow">the people of Hubaekje will accept you as their king.</font>

204
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,378
<font color="yellow">They will be loyal to you.</font>

205
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:04,410
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

206
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:09,980
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think about it</font>

207
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,326
<font color="yellow">I feel like I would be losing out.</font>

208
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:18,238
<font color="yellow">I have a good offer.</font>

209
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:31,922
<font color="yellow">I heard that the 4th Prince, that dog, is out to kill his brother.</font>

210
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,297
<font color="yellow">Be quiet! You'll get yourself in trouble.</font>

211
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:41,038
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense that the playful, carefree 10th Prince would plot treason.</font>

212
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,346
<font color="yellow">The 4th Prince is acting like the king's dog.</font>

213
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:47,502
<font color="yellow">It's probably all made up. You should know something.</font>

214
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:49,031
<font color="yellow">Just eat up.</font>

215
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,058
<font color="yellow">I found the boat. It leaves in five days.</font>

216
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,346
<font color="yellow">- Where is it headed? - That's the thing...</font>

217
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:04,049
<font color="yellow">There are four different boats leaving at the same time on the same day.</font>

218
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,048
<font color="yellow">I don't know which one they will take.</font>

219
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:14,111
<font color="yellow">You aren't really going to catch Eun and take him in, are you?</font>

220
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,615
<font color="yellow">You do not trust me either, do you?</font>

221
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:20,587
<font color="yellow">I do not trust our third brother.</font>

222
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:24,709
<font color="yellow">A person who manipulates people and uses their weaknesses has become king.</font>

223
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,367
<font color="yellow">The future looks bleak.</font>

224
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:30,018
<font color="yellow">Find out if Eun has reached out to anyone.</font>

225
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,491
<font color="yellow">Like Jung, for example.</font>

226
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:35,858
<font color="yellow">Perhaps because Wook has a history with our 3rd brother</font>

227
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:37,803
<font color="yellow">they say he has not made a move at all.</font>

228
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:42,296
<font color="yellow">Who could have guessed he would have come back alive?</font>

229
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,476
<font color="yellow">Woo Hee.</font>

230
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,201
<font color="yellow">It has been a long time.</font>

231
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:58,474
<font color="yellow">Yes, Baek Ah told me you had returned.</font>

232
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:00,957
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo will be happy to see you.</font>

233
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:03,246
<font color="yellow">I will probably see her soon.</font>

234
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:06,047
<font color="yellow">I will be going back to the Gyobang.</font>

235
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:08,291
<font color="yellow">Gyobang?</font>

236
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:10,554
<font color="yellow">You didn't say that before.</font>

237
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:12,655
<font color="yellow">How long can I depend on you for support?</font>

238
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:16,490
<font color="yellow">I won't be a gisaeng. I'm just going to teach dance.</font>

239
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,685
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.</font>

240
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:33,898
<font color="yellow">It's very late. Where are you off to?</font>

241
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,646
<font color="yellow">You are awfully interested in me.</font>

242
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:42,846
<font color="yellow">I get the feeling that it is you who is behind all of this.</font>

243
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,269
<font color="yellow">So I wondered if you were visiting him again.</font>

244
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:51,184
<font color="yellow">What would make you think such a thing?</font>

245
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:56,255
<font color="yellow">The late king had been addicted to mercury for at least two years.</font>

246
00:21:56,734 --> 00:22:00,153
<font color="yellow">The 9th Prince Won seemed to be the most likely suspect.</font>

247
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:03,451
<font color="yellow">However, it was too detailed and well-planned.</font>

248
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:06,454
<font color="yellow">It doesn't fit Won's personality.</font>

249
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:09,666
<font color="yellow">But maybe if it were you...</font>

250
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,886
<font color="yellow">It's also strange that the king is leaving you alone.</font>

251
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:20,885
<font color="yellow">A man like that would have gotten rid of you already.</font>

252
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:24,015
<font color="yellow">You got rid of the 10th Prince's family</font>

253
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:25,835
<font color="yellow">and one of Songak's most powerful families.</font>

254
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:33,085
<font color="yellow">Aside from a smart person like you, I have to wonder who else could do it.</font>

255
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:37,549
<font color="yellow">You have always been suspicious of me.</font>

256
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:47,884
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

257
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,913
<font color="yellow">really cause our brother's death?</font>

258
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:54,496
<font color="yellow">How about you?</font>

259
00:22:55,816 --> 00:23:00,105
<font color="yellow">Are you going to become the king's dog and kill Eun?</font>

260
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:08,476
<font color="yellow">We are both struggling to survive.</font>

261
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:14,573
<font color="yellow">That is the fate of a prince who does not become a king.</font>

262
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:20,384
<font color="yellow">In order to protect, you must submit.</font>

263
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,804
<font color="yellow">I don't know what made you change so much.</font>

264
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:31,484
<font color="yellow">I... did not poison the late king.</font>

265
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:35,854
<font color="yellow">Does that answer your question?</font>

266
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:12,693
<font color="yellow">Why did you put mercury in the king's bath water?</font>

267
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:17,566
<font color="yellow">I never did such a thing.</font>

268
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:21,385
<font color="yellow">Would you say the same thing after being tortured?</font>

269
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,154
<font color="yellow">If so...</font>

270
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:27,259
<font color="yellow">I would say you told me to do it, Your Majesty.</font>

271
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:30,670
<font color="yellow">I would say that you ordered me to do it because you wanted the throne.</font>

272
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:34,486
<font color="yellow">I will say that even if I die.</font>

273
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,025
<font color="yellow">You are quite something, aren't you?</font>

274
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:41,704
<font color="yellow">I suppose you were always this way since you were young.</font>

275
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:44,026
<font color="yellow">It is amusing.</font>

276
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,736
<font color="yellow">I will not get rid you.</font>

277
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:51,989
<font color="yellow">You are the best bait I can use to control my brothers.</font>

278
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:54,325
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

279
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:59,439
<font color="yellow">please tell me who really put mercury in the water.</font>

280
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:03,377
<font color="yellow">You believe that I know who did it?</font>

281
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:06,906
<font color="yellow">Even if I know who did it, I cannot breathe a word about it.</font>

282
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:11,442
<font color="yellow">If you say that I committed regicide, that is the end for me.</font>

283
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,777
<font color="yellow">So, I would like to know.</font>

284
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:19,876
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

285
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,929
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty, His Highness the 8th Prince is here to see you.</font>

286
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:32,484
<font color="yellow">How is it that he showed up right on time?</font>

287
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:35,128
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

288
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,538
<font color="yellow">Greetings, Your Majesty.</font>

289
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,045
<font color="yellow">I had a question to ask you, so it's a good thing you are here.</font>

290
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,191
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo is dying of curiosity.</font>

291
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:08,469
<font color="yellow">Who was it that put mercury in the late king's bath water?</font>

292
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,775
<font color="yellow">I believe the late king died of an illness.</font>

293
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,226
<font color="yellow">Is that not true?</font>

294
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:25,257
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's true.</font>

295
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:27,945
<font color="yellow">He passed away from an illness.</font>

296
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:54,835
<font color="yellow">I heard that you witnessed what happened to the late king.</font>

297
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,486
<font color="yellow">It must have been shocking.</font>

298
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:01,145
<font color="yellow">He was like an older brother to me, as well.</font>

299
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:05,829
<font color="yellow">The person who made him die so tragically...</font>

300
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:10,892
<font color="yellow">who could it be?</font>

301
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:18,170
<font color="yellow">Your Highness...</font>

302
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,641
<font color="yellow">you are not connected to it, are you?</font>

303
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,000
<font color="yellow">I had to commit treason in order to protect you and our family.</font>

304
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:36,479
<font color="yellow">If you wanted to live in a dignified way, you shouldn't have burdened me.</font>

305
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,772
<font color="yellow">Is this because of Hae Soo?</font>

306
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:44,507
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you if Hae Soo had anything to do with the decisions that you made.</font>

307
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:52,955
<font color="yellow">Yes. I did consider her.</font>

308
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:56,386
<font color="yellow">It is because of her.</font>

309
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,688
<font color="yellow">My life has been filled with pressure from family</font>

310
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:01,171
<font color="yellow">and the burden of responsibility.</font>

311
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:05,765
<font color="yellow">The only thing I wanted so badly was Hae Soo.</font>

312
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,747
<font color="yellow">I lost her.</font>

313
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,564
<font color="yellow">What was it that went wrong?</font>

314
00:28:17,255 --> 00:28:18,325
<font color="yellow">Soo says...</font>

315
00:28:19,954 --> 00:28:23,284
<font color="yellow">I tried to have everything and that was wrong, but why?</font>

316
00:28:28,424 --> 00:28:30,132
<font color="yellow">I tried to protect my family and my heart.</font>

317
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:31,275
<font color="yellow">What's so wrong with that?</font>

318
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:36,144
<font color="yellow">Mother, you told me to live right and I lived my life that way.</font>

319
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,940
<font color="yellow">So why am I still lonely?</font>

320
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,980
<font color="yellow">Wook, why didn't you say this earlier?</font>

321
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,451
<font color="yellow">We can turn things around now.</font>

322
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:54,864
<font color="yellow">- Change your mind and stop this. - No.</font>

323
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,251
<font color="yellow">I have already started down this path.</font>

324
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:01,510
<font color="yellow">I will live this way and achieve what I want.</font>

325
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:06,013
<font color="yellow">I won't be foolish and lose what I want.</font>

326
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,622
<font color="yellow">I have done nothing wrong.</font>

327
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:37,971
<font color="yellow">Soo!</font>

328
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:47,988
<font color="yellow">I heard the king called you in</font>

329
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,742
<font color="yellow">so I thought something had happened to you.</font>

330
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:52,836
<font color="yellow">It does not seem like he intends to kill me or kick me out.</font>

331
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,712
<font color="yellow">He plans to use you as bait to manipulate me.</font>

332
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:02,095
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

333
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:06,673
<font color="yellow">Even so, I prefer you being safe.</font>

334
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:11,411
<font color="yellow">About what you said before...</font>

335
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,459
<font color="yellow">what happened to the people you were looking for?</font>

336
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,762
<font color="yellow">To tell you the truth...</font>

337
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,237
<font color="yellow">I am looking for Eun.</font>

338
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:30,439
<font color="yellow">The king wants to find him and kill him.</font>

339
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:33,299
<font color="yellow">But I need to do whatever I can to help him escape.</font>

340
00:30:34,987 --> 00:30:36,092
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

341
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:40,973
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I will find him.</font>

342
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:04,718
<font color="yellow">Where is Court Lady Hae?</font>

343
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,895
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I do not know.</font>

344
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:12,308
<font color="yellow">You there.</font>

345
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,898
<font color="yellow">Do you know where Court Lady Hae is?</font>

346
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,219
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

347
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,099
<font color="yellow">Why do you have such poor manners?</font>

348
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:28,461
<font color="yellow">I apologize, Your Highness.</font>

349
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,570
<font color="yellow">Sister-in-law.</font>

350
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,960
<font color="yellow">It is you, right?</font>

351
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,277
<font color="yellow">It is you.</font>

352
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:51,645
<font color="yellow">We have to leave the palace to get on the boat.</font>

353
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:55,093
<font color="yellow">Are you playing here? There are no other doors.</font>

354
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:57,836
<font color="yellow">North, south, west, or east. There are no easy exits.</font>

355
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:00,773
<font color="yellow">There are more guards now than when we entered.</font>

356
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:05,085
<font color="yellow">After usurping the throne, Yo is afraid he may get hit someday.</font>

357
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:08,006
<font color="yellow">I am ashamed that he is my brother.</font>

358
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,616
<font color="yellow">I wish we had Ji Mong's flying contraption.</font>

359
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:14,741
<font color="yellow">Or maybe a hole in the ground...</font>

360
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:19,257
<font color="yellow">A cave? There is one.</font>

361
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:21,715
<font color="yellow">There is a way out!</font>

362
00:32:42,673 --> 00:32:43,851
<font color="yellow">Soo!</font>

363
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,675
<font color="yellow">I would like to say goodbye to my father.</font>

364
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:55,226
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I could reach him through Choi Ji Mong?</font>

365
00:32:55,226 --> 00:32:56,583
<font color="yellow">That is dangerous.</font>

366
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,259
<font color="yellow">The astronomer is also close to the 4th Prince.</font>

367
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,055
<font color="yellow">I thought this earlier.</font>

368
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:08,118
<font color="yellow">How come you don't trust the 4th Prince?</font>

369
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:10,789
<font color="yellow">You have a special relationship.</font>

370
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:14,211
<font color="yellow">I have my reasons.</font>

371
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:18,250
<font color="yellow">If you're doing so because of us, then I am thankful.</font>

372
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:21,471
<font color="yellow">Still, I think it's a bit wrong.</font>

373
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:25,073
<font color="yellow">I know there are some bad rumors about the 4th Prince.</font>

374
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,810
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't go around catching people for no reason.</font>

375
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,965
<font color="yellow">Unless you experienced something bad yourself...</font>

376
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:32,834
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you trust the person that you like?</font>

377
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:37,736
<font color="yellow">You are right.</font>

378
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,586
<font color="yellow">You are right, my lady.</font>

379
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,913
<font color="yellow">I was being foolish. I never had any first-hand experience.</font>

380
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:50,483
<font color="yellow">I will visit the astronomer.</font>

381
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,072
<font color="yellow">Astronomer?</font>

382
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,648
<font color="yellow">Ji Mong!</font>

383
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:40,798
<font color="yellow">The 10th Prince's binary star has risen near the palace.</font>

384
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,387
<font color="yellow">You should try looking again.</font>

385
00:34:43,387 --> 00:34:44,978
<font color="yellow">I've looked everywhere.</font>

386
00:34:44,978 --> 00:34:47,351
<font color="yellow">I went to the Damiwon and Eun was not there.</font>

387
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,759
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

388
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:56,411
<font color="yellow">How much can I trust you at times like this?</font>

389
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:00,188
<font color="yellow">Did you know that Moo would die in that way?</font>

390
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:03,155
<font color="yellow">Did you know that my 3rd brother would become the king?</font>

391
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:09,786
<font color="yellow">Can you imagine what it is like for me to know and not get involved?</font>

392
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:13,056
<font color="yellow">It is the divine punishment for those who read the heavens.</font>

393
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,306
<font color="yellow">However, even I was surprised by the 3rd Prince.</font>

394
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:20,527
<font color="yellow">He was only born with the star of one who would commit treason.</font>

395
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,987
<font color="yellow">Something has definitely changed.</font>

396
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:25,235
<font color="yellow">Something has deviated.</font>

397
00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:30,505
<font color="yellow">What has changed to make the 3rd Prince become king?</font>

398
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:33,135
<font color="yellow">I am curious.</font>

399
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:46,782
<font color="yellow">Be careful of the 4th Prince.</font>

400
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,800
<font color="yellow">The 4th Prince...</font>

401
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:52,769
<font color="yellow">Be careful of Wang So.</font>

402
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:56,338
<font color="yellow">Wook?</font>

403
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,619
<font color="yellow">That is what Hae Soo said to me.</font>

404
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,311
<font color="yellow">Be careful of the 4th Prince.</font>

405
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:09,949
<font color="yellow">She said I should not try to stop him.</font>

406
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:13,829
<font color="yellow">It's just as she said.</font>

407
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,949
<font color="yellow">He's taking everything.</font>

408
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:22,822
<font color="yellow">No matter what I do...</font>

409
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,789
<font color="yellow">everything will become his.</font>

410
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:31,998
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

411
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,599
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

412
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,811
<font color="yellow">Why do you carry around a hairpin?</font>

413
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:28,713
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

414
00:37:30,327 --> 00:37:33,266
<font color="yellow">You have to give it back to me.</font>

415
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:35,817
<font color="yellow">By the looks of it, it's not new.</font>

416
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,833
<font color="yellow">Does it belong to a girl you love?</font>

417
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:45,757
<font color="yellow">I thought all you cared about was fighting.</font>

418
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,318
<font color="yellow">I am curious about who she is.</font>

419
00:37:55,958 --> 00:38:00,342
<font color="yellow">She is someone who put her life on the line for me.</font>

420
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,766
<font color="yellow">She put her whole body on the line in order to save me.</font>

421
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:11,219
<font color="yellow">Hey! Back off, back off!</font>

422
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:13,873
<font color="yellow">Get back! You're dead if you come any closer.</font>

423
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:16,302
<font color="yellow">Get back, you scoundrels! Get back!</font>

424
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:33,248
<font color="yellow">At first, it was when I saw her sing.</font>

425
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,291
<font color="yellow">That was when I knew.</font>

426
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:42,429
<font color="yellow">Someday, I wanted her to sing only for me.</font>

427
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:44,579
<font color="yellow">I started to wish for that.</font>

428
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:47,280
<font color="yellow">Are those feelings...</font>

429
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:52,505
<font color="yellow">what it means to like someone?</font>

430
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,420
<font color="yellow">I am certain of it.</font>

431
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,804
<font color="yellow">I have been through it, so I know.</font>

432
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:02,184
<font color="yellow">You have?</font>

433
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,655
<font color="yellow">When my older sister was chosen to become the king's wife</font>

434
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:20,010
<font color="yellow">all the girls in the powerful families gathered to play together.</font>

435
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,364
<font color="yellow">Even back then, I was much more comfortable in my armor.</font>

436
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:28,335
<font color="yellow">To the other children, I was like a different species.</font>

437
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:31,016
<font color="yellow">I'd prefer being on the battleground.</font>

438
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:39,492
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

439
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,393
<font color="yellow">Don't you like this flower ring?</font>

440
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:51,876
<font color="yellow">That's strange.</font>

441
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:54,978
<font color="yellow">All pretty girls seem to like flower rings.</font>

442
00:39:56,047 --> 00:39:59,137
<font color="yellow">You will like it too, right?</font>

443
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:10,454
<font color="yellow">If you truly like someone, you will never be confused about it.</font>

444
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,760
<font color="yellow">Do not be worried about it and go for it.</font>

445
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,188
<font color="yellow">I will cheer you on.</font>

446
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,942
<font color="yellow">My first love came true.</font>

447
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,202
<font color="yellow">Since I will be cheering you on</font>

448
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:23,811
<font color="yellow">I know yours will come true, Your Highness.</font>

449
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:35,043
<font color="yellow">Go get it!</font>

450
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:39,155
<font color="yellow">Greetings to you, Your Majesty.</font>

451
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,204
<font color="yellow">I am sorry to come so late.</font>

452
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,387
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on becoming king.</font>

453
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,699
<font color="yellow">I was going to call you in soon.</font>

454
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,896
<font color="yellow">I had news regarding your marriage.</font>

455
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,246
<font color="yellow">I will send you to Khitan.</font>

456
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:15,126
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

457
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,885
<font color="yellow">The late king had promised them Princess Kyung Hwa</font>

458
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:21,239
<font color="yellow">and then married her off to So.</font>

459
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:26,309
<font color="yellow">Therefore, I have agreed to send a royal who is just as high in status.</font>

460
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:33,565
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your marriage, Yeon Hwa.</font>

461
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:40,594
<font color="yellow">Why is it that everyone in that seat threatens me with marriage?</font>

462
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:44,206
<font color="yellow">Whether it be the person who conceived me or the person I grew up with.</font>

463
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:46,184
<font color="yellow">You are all the same.</font>

464
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:51,505
<font color="yellow">You must believe there is no better way to control a woman than marriage.</font>

465
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:54,217
<font color="yellow">I am disappointed in you.</font>

466
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:58,385
<font color="yellow">You're not still greedy to be a queen, are you?</font>

467
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:03,518
<font color="yellow">Your brother betrayed me and you were on his side.</font>

468
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:06,746
<font color="yellow">I cannot...</font>

469
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:10,326
<font color="yellow">have a household like that as in-laws.</font>

470
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,070
<font color="yellow">Also, I have someone else I want.</font>

471
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,891
<font color="yellow">Without Soo...</font>

472
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:44,349
<font color="yellow">I would not even have a future.</font>

473
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,420
<font color="yellow">I am nothing without her.</font>

474
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,070
<font color="yellow">It is so stuffy in here.</font>

475
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,791
<font color="yellow">I've been running around this palace since I was a boy.</font>

476
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:40,376
<font color="yellow">Is there nowhere I can go besides this one room?</font>

477
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,068
<font color="yellow">At least you can go out.</font>

478
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:45,617
<font color="yellow">It has been days for me.</font>

479
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:50,947
<font color="yellow">Would you like to take a bath?</font>

480
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:55,436
<font color="yellow">Hae Soo does not allow the court ladies in at night, so it will be all right.</font>

481
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:42,586
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

482
00:44:43,864 --> 00:44:46,626
<font color="yellow">Wow! That is amazing.</font>

483
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:48,835
<font color="yellow">It looks like the real thing.</font>

484
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:54,246
<font color="yellow">Well, I'll have to show you all my skills.</font>

485
00:45:01,806 --> 00:45:04,717
<font color="yellow">All right, start!</font>

486
00:45:43,628 --> 00:45:45,431
<font color="yellow">Yes! I won!</font>

487
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:47,619
<font color="yellow">See that? I won again.</font>

488
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:55,416
<font color="yellow">Put your arm out.</font>

489
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:14,588
<font color="yellow">My hand hurts from hitting you too much.</font>

490
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:18,704
<font color="yellow">Why does it hurt so much?</font>

491
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:21,947
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

492
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:26,802
<font color="yellow">I was going to give this to you and I forgot.</font>

493
00:46:29,175 --> 00:46:30,202
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

494
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:35,016
<font color="yellow">remembered to bring this in all that confusion?</font>

495
00:46:35,016 --> 00:46:37,697
<font color="yellow">It's your favorite thing.</font>

496
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:40,373
<font color="yellow">Your slingshot.</font>

497
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:58,309
<font color="yellow">What prince?</font>

498
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:05,181
<font color="yellow">I would have wanted to open the largest novelty goods shop in Songak.</font>

499
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:07,010
<font color="yellow">That was my dream.</font>

500
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,922
<font color="yellow">You can do that.</font>

501
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:13,324
<font color="yellow">We can go to Tamra and you should open a novelty goods shop, Your Highness.</font>

502
00:47:13,543 --> 00:47:15,391
<font color="yellow">I will teach martial arts.</font>

503
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,103
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

504
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,623
<font color="yellow">I did manage to bring this one thing.</font>

505
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:44,414
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

506
00:47:46,536 --> 00:47:48,744
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Hae Soo will like it.</font>

507
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:50,077
<font color="yellow">It's yours.</font>

508
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:56,119
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hwa was asking what kind of girl doesn't even have an incense pouch.</font>

509
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you embarrassing your husband?</font>

510
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,311
<font color="yellow">Do you not like it?</font>

511
00:48:12,628 --> 00:48:14,090
<font color="yellow">That's strange.</font>

512
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:17,519
<font color="yellow">They say all pretty girls like it.</font>

513
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,829
<font color="yellow">That's strange.</font>

514
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:24,059
<font color="yellow">All pretty girls seem to like flower rings.</font>

515
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,648
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying that you're pretty.</font>

516
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:34,965
<font color="yellow">Just that... lately...</font>

517
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:37,217
<font color="yellow">you don't look so bad.</font>

518
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,119
<font color="yellow">I have some eye issues.</font>

519
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:55,657
<font color="yellow">I understand what you are saying.</font>

520
00:48:57,697 --> 00:48:59,480
<font color="yellow">Even flowers from a pumpkin...</font>

521
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:02,759
<font color="yellow">are still flowers.</font>

522
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:12,023
<font color="yellow">I want two sons and two daughters.</font>

523
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:14,123
<font color="yellow">I won't have it any other way.</font>

524
00:49:15,094 --> 00:49:19,175
<font color="yellow">Will kissing make me pregnant?</font>

525
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:32,764
<font color="yellow">It would have been nice to live like this from the beginning.</font>

526
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,693
<font color="yellow">Let's head inside.</font>

527
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,699
<font color="yellow">You'll freeze to death before the king catches us.</font>

528
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:48,340
<font color="yellow">Wait! Am I with child right now?</font>

529
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:52,298
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

530
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,989
<font color="yellow">My lady, there must have been a ghost.</font>

531
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,418
<font color="yellow">I am certain that I cleaned up before sleeping.</font>

532
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:11,737
<font color="yellow">Did someone come by?</font>

533
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:14,478
<font color="yellow">I made them.</font>

534
00:51:15,047 --> 00:51:17,070
<font color="yellow">I thought I might decorate the Damiwon with them.</font>

535
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:21,018
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

536
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,523
<font color="yellow">How did he make this?</font>

537
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,963
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

538
00:51:44,963 --> 00:51:47,114
<font color="yellow">I will get the attendants ready to serve you.</font>

539
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:48,942
<font color="yellow">I came to talk to you.</font>

540
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,483
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

541
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,934
<font color="yellow">Then this way, please.</font>

542
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:23,643
<font color="yellow">Leave So.</font>

543
00:52:25,193 --> 00:52:27,844
<font color="yellow">I know what you did with Wook.</font>

544
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,652
<font color="yellow">I know you haven't told So and now he's bewitched by you.</font>

545
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:36,715
<font color="yellow">I cannot bear to see this indecent behavior anymore, so leave him first.</font>

546
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,746
<font color="yellow">Then I won't cause a problem either.</font>

547
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:44,847
<font color="yellow">Your goal in getting married is to leave the palace.</font>

548
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,644
<font color="yellow">I will do that for you.</font>

549
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:49,159
<font color="yellow">I can get you married into a family</font>

550
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:51,400
<font color="yellow">that's on a similar level to that of a prince.</font>

551
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:55,715
<font color="yellow">Marriage might be a goal for you, Your Highness, but not for me.</font>

552
00:52:56,697 --> 00:52:58,775
<font color="yellow">He is happy because of me.</font>

553
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:04,934
<font color="yellow">He makes me feel valued and that is why I want to marry.</font>

554
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,695
<font color="yellow">If he remains steadfast...</font>

555
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,641
<font color="yellow">there is no reason for me to change.</font>

556
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,052
<font color="yellow">I will not leave him first.</font>

557
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:21,981
<font color="yellow">Now I know why I have always hated you.</font>

558
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:25,231
<font color="yellow">For you, feelings and marriage...</font>

559
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,016
<font color="yellow">are all just silly games.</font>

560
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:31,318
<font color="yellow">They aren't life and death like they are for me.</font>

561
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:41,052
<font color="yellow">Don't be so confident that you will not change.</font>

562
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:45,032
<font color="yellow">No one says such things in the palace.</font>

563
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:49,907
<font color="yellow">You will have many regrets.</font>

564
00:53:49,907 --> 00:53:54,099
<font color="yellow">I promise you I will make you regret this.</font>

565
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,112
<font color="yellow">Grand General Park Soo Kyung and Astronomer Choi Ji Mong.</font>

566
00:54:32,112 --> 00:54:36,224
<font color="yellow">Those with military and religious power are sticking by 4th Prince Wang So.</font>

567
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:40,327
<font color="yellow">You must get rid of the 4th Prince as soon as possible.</font>

568
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,465
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long since we planned Wang Gyu's revolt.</font>

569
00:54:44,956 --> 00:54:47,175
<font color="yellow">Also, So is a brother who shared the same womb as me.</font>

570
00:54:47,998 --> 00:54:51,407
<font color="yellow">Even when I attack him, the timing must be right.</font>

571
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:57,077
<font color="yellow">Then you must separate Park Soo Kyung and Choi Ji Mong.</font>

572
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:08,813
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

573
00:55:25,628 --> 00:55:28,630
<font color="yellow">I wish to make things a little easier for the two of you.</font>

574
00:55:30,364 --> 00:55:32,155
<font color="yellow">- What? - In return...</font>

575
00:55:32,155 --> 00:55:36,429
<font color="yellow">if my plan works out, cancel my marriage to Khitan.</font>

576
00:55:45,311 --> 00:55:49,291
<font color="yellow">If you follow this path out to the cave, Jung will be waiting outside.</font>

577
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:52,590
<font color="yellow">He will help you get safely to the boat.</font>

578
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:56,351
<font color="yellow">It's some dried meat.</font>

579
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,510
<font color="yellow">Just in case.</font>

580
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,061
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

581
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:07,034
<font color="yellow">very much.</font>

582
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:13,079
<font color="yellow">Soo. I'll see you when I come back.</font>

583
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:16,019
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll be waiting for you.</font>

584
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:18,650
<font color="yellow">By the way, what about my father?</font>

585
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,701
<font color="yellow">I left a letter. I'm sure he will meet you on the way.</font>

586
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,030
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

587
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:42,952
<font color="yellow">Run! There are royal guards everywhere outside.</font>

588
00:56:42,952 --> 00:56:45,525
<font color="yellow">- Jung. - I will stop them, so run!</font>

589
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:46,585
<font color="yellow">You too!</font>

590
00:57:02,606 --> 00:57:05,556
<font color="yellow">We are here for the 10th Prince. Find him now!</font>

591
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:06,632
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir!</font>

592
00:57:18,922 --> 00:57:20,831
<font color="yellow">Take the prince another way.</font>

593
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:23,246
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

594
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:26,376
<font color="yellow">They won't be able to kill me because of my father.</font>

595
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,389
<font color="yellow">They are after you, Your Highness.</font>

596
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:29,815
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

597
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,096
<font color="yellow">Let's go together.</font>

598
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,391
<font color="yellow">I will follow you soon.</font>

599
00:57:42,735 --> 00:57:44,016
<font color="yellow">I promise you.</font>

600
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:47,994
<font color="yellow">I'm trusting you.</font>

601
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:03,045
<font color="yellow">Listen to your wife and run, Your Highness.</font>

602
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:07,945
<font color="yellow">I can't do it. I can't hide behind my wife in shame like this.</font>

603
00:58:08,755 --> 00:58:10,014
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

604
00:58:15,036 --> 00:58:16,269
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

605
00:58:17,184 --> 00:58:19,003
<font color="yellow">I am her awesome person now.</font>

606
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:24,782
<font color="yellow">I am all she has.</font>

607
