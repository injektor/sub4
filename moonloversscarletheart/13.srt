<font color="yellow">If I say it is marriage, it is marriage.</font>

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,800
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,250

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,030
<font color="yellow">Find our eighth brother now!</font>

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,590

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,670
<font color="yellow">Where are you saying you will go?</font>

24
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,990
<font color="yellow">Please do not say weak things
that do not even suit you.</font>

25
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,450
<font color="yellow">How short and fleeting it was.</font>

26
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,230
<font color="yellow">What have I been
living for all this time?</font>

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,790
<font color="yellow">You have founded an empire, Your Majesty.</font>

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,780
<font color="yellow">An empire?</font>

29
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,250
<font color="yellow">Will Goryeo last forever?</font>

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,390
<font color="yellow">Did I make the right decision
in choosing Crown Prince Moo?</font>

31
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,440
<font color="yellow">We can confirm that you made
the right decision, Your Majesty.</font>

32
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,360
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince will rise to the throne.</font>

33
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,870
<font color="yellow">I see I have very good friends.</font>

34
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,640
<font color="yellow">My war is over now.</font>

35
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,620
<font color="yellow">Now, your battle is starting.</font>

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,230
<font color="yellow">Watch over the Crown Prince...</font>

37
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,480
<font color="yellow">and the 4th Prince, as well.</font>

38
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,860
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,790
<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

40
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,780
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

41
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,850
<font color="yellow">While it was hard to travel as an ambassador.</font>

42
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,980
<font color="yellow">I often felt very free.</font>

43
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,490
<font color="yellow">I thought of you every time.</font>

44
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,550
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to feel freedom like that.</font>

45
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,540
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

46
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,610
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince must not
find out about this situation.</font>

47
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,960
<font color="yellow">All roads out of Songak
have been blocked.</font>

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
<font color="yellow">The moment that the king passes away</font>

49
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,230
<font color="yellow">we must secure his last decree
and grab our chance at victory.</font>

50
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,360
<font color="yellow">Wook, how is the king?</font>

51
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,860
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

52
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,820
<font color="yellow">Your Highnesses, you should all return.</font>

53
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,460
<font color="yellow">His Majesty will give his commands soon.</font>

54
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,360
<font color="yellow">We cannot do that.</font>

55
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,650
<font color="yellow">If the king is suffering from an illness</font>

56
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,640
<font color="yellow">we need to protect Cheondeokjeon
so his last decree remains unchanged.</font>

57
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,400
<font color="yellow">It's not that you wish to
change his last decree?</font>

58
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,600
<font color="yellow">If you do not wish
to be suspected of that</font>

59
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
<font color="yellow">you should all leave this place.</font>

60
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,550
<font color="yellow">I do not see So.</font>

61
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,820
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

62
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,160
<font color="yellow">Whoever steps into Cheondeokjeon
without His Majesty's permission...</font>

63
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,780
<font color="yellow">will be stabbed as a criminal
guilty of treason.</font>

64
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,030
<font color="yellow">So, it is best for you to all leave now.</font>

65
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,490
<font color="yellow">Move! I must see the king for myself.</font>

66
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,770
<font color="yellow">You dare to stop me? Do you wish to die?</font>

67
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,020
<font color="yellow">Step aside.</font>

68
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,200
<font color="yellow">Ji Mong, are you hiding
the condition of the king?</font>

69
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,990
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

70
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,430
<font color="yellow">What about the princes?
You haven't harmed them, have you?</font>

71
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,140
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

72
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,140
<font color="yellow">The princes have returned to their homes.</font>

73
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,320
<font color="yellow">You are buying time until
the Crown Prince arrives.</font>

74
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,100
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

75
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,160
<font color="yellow">Even the aroma of your tea
is like that of Soo Yeon's.</font>

76
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,590
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling all right?</font>

77
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,650
<font color="yellow">I will be dying soon.</font>

78
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,040
<font color="yellow">Bring the Crown Prince.</font>

79
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,400
<font color="yellow">He must come before it's too late.</font>

80
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,180
<font color="yellow">You want me to do it?</font>

81
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,360
<font color="yellow">I will find someone who can go quickly.</font>

82
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,800
<font color="yellow">No, it must be you.</font>

83
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,410
<font color="yellow">No one from inside the palace...</font>

84
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,450
<font color="yellow">must find out about my death
before the Crown Prince arrives.</font>

85
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,480
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

86
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,280
<font color="yellow">Once you leave this room,
someone will approach you.</font>

87
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,280
<font color="yellow">That person will ask you
about my condition.</font>

88
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,400
<font color="yellow">To the person who merely asks how I am...</font>

89
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,740
<font color="yellow">tell that person
I am asking for more tea.</font>

90
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,670
<font color="yellow">To the person who asks if I am dead,
you need to be careful.</font>

91
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,410
<font color="yellow">That person is after the throne.</font>

92
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,230
<font color="yellow"><i>Get going.</i></font>

93
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,590
<font color="yellow"><i>You cannot trust anyone.</i></font>

94
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:43,930
<font color="yellow"><i>The fate of the Goryeo Empire
rests on your shoulders.</i></font>

95
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,420
<font color="yellow"><i>That is probably
the reason you are here.</i></font>

96
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,760
<font color="yellow">- Be on guard.
- Yes, Grand General.</font>

97
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,160
<font color="yellow">Step aside unless you want to die.</font>

98
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,580
<font color="yellow">No one can leave Songak.</font>

99
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,750
<font color="yellow">I'm sure these are Wook's orders.</font>

100
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,040
<font color="yellow">My suspicions were correct.</font>

101
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,280
<font color="yellow">Last night, I saw that Wook
was wearing his armor.</font>

102
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,080
<font color="yellow">I saw it very clearly under his sleeve.</font>

103
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,240
<font color="yellow">I wondered why he would secretly
wear armor into the palace.</font>

104
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,700
<font color="yellow">Was he planning on killing the king
at the peace gathering?</font>

105
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,160
<font color="yellow">Soo.</font>

106
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,740
<font color="yellow">Where are you off to in such a hurry?</font>

107
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,260
<font color="yellow">The king is asking for more tea.</font>

108
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,650
<font color="yellow">I am going to the Damiwon.</font>

109
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,140
<font color="yellow">What is this about marriage with So?</font>

110
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,690
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you had
that kind of relationship.</font>

111
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,930
<font color="yellow">I was surprised.</font>

112
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,780
<font color="yellow">You're mistaken. The 4th Prince was...</font>

113
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,190
<font color="yellow">I have errands to run for the king.</font>

114
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,930
<font color="yellow">I will speak to you once I return.</font>

115
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,610
<font color="yellow">- I...
- By any chance...</font>

116
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,570
<font color="yellow">Has the king passed away?</font>

117
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,510
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about him.</font>

118
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,190
<font color="yellow">Has the king died?</font>

119
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,790
<font color="yellow"><i>To the person who asks if I am dead,
you need to be careful.</i></font>

120
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,010
<font color="yellow">That person is after the throne.</font>

121
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,370
<font color="yellow">Your Highness...</font>

122
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,040
<font color="yellow">do you...</font>

123
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,200
<font color="yellow">want to become king?</font>

124
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,360
<font color="yellow">Last night's events are not important.</font>

125
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,020
<font color="yellow">The king has passed out now.</font>

126
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,570
<font color="yellow">The question is,
who will sit on the throne?</font>

127
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,300
<font color="yellow">The king's successor is Crown Prince Moo.</font>

128
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,950
<font color="yellow">That is his will.</font>

129
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,620
<font color="yellow">What do you want, So?</font>

130
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,130
<font color="yellow">Do you want to become king?</font>

131
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,430
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

132
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,780
<font color="yellow">going to become king?</font>

133
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,050
<font color="yellow">Is becoming king something so easy
that you can become one if you want?</font>

134
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,270
<font color="yellow">You can become one if I help you.</font>

135
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,420
<font color="yellow">If the Hwangbos and I support you</font>

136
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,210
<font color="yellow">you can become king.</font>

137
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,550
<font color="yellow">When I lost you...</font>

138
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,930
<font color="yellow">I could not do anything with
the limited power that I had.</font>

139
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,830
<font color="yellow">In order to protect those
I love inside this palace</font>

140
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,360
<font color="yellow">I realized that I need to
become the most powerful.</font>

141
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,130
<font color="yellow">What can one do if they become king?</font>

142
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,580
<font color="yellow">The world will become yours.</font>

143
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,500
<font color="yellow">You can have everything.</font>

144
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,410
<font color="yellow">Then can I have a
person's heart, as well?</font>

145
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,500
<font color="yellow">If I become king,
will the heart I so desire become mine?</font>

146
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,320
<font color="yellow">You asked if I am going to become king.</font>

147
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,080
<font color="yellow">I am going to become king.</font>

148
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,260
<font color="yellow">If so...</font>

149
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,100
<font color="yellow">I will do it.</font>

150
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,470
<font color="yellow">I will... become king.</font>

151
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,620
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty, are you all right?</font>

152
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,100
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

153
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,060
<font color="yellow">Are you awake?</font>

154
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,060
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

155
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,700
<font color="yellow">He has passed away.</font>

156
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,740
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

157
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
<font color="yellow">How can you leave me behind?</font>

158
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,260
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes!</font>

159
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,490
<font color="yellow">Queen Yoo.</font>

160
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,790
<font color="yellow">You cannot leave me behind like this.</font>

161
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,520
<font color="yellow">Come back!</font>

162
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,060
<font color="yellow">You can't leave like this!</font>

163
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,260
<font color="yellow">You can't throw me away like this!</font>

164
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,310
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty! Come back.</font>

165
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,730
<font color="yellow">Come back! Open your eyes.</font>

166
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,390
<font color="yellow">Come back, come back!</font>

167
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,190
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

168
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,120
<font color="yellow">Come back to me.</font>

169
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,790
<font color="yellow">You terrible person.</font>

170
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,110
<font color="yellow">For your sake, I will become king.</font>

171
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,070
<font color="yellow">For my sake?
You're doing this because of me?</font>

172
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,610
<font color="yellow">It has already started.</font>

173
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,330
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow, I will attack Cheondeokjeon
with my third brother.</font>

174
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,040
<font color="yellow">No, you can't do that.</font>

175
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,040
<font color="yellow">That is treason.</font>

176
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,990
<font color="yellow">Soo! The Crown Prince will
not be able to return anyway.</font>

177
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,370
<font color="yellow">Fighting over an empty seat is
just a battle over a throne.</font>

178
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,680
<font color="yellow">So, do not say anything to anyone.</font>

179
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,500
<font color="yellow">You only to need to hide and wait for me.</font>

180
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,190
<font color="yellow">You can do that, right?</font>

181
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,020
<font color="yellow">I will ask you one more time.</font>

182
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,660
<font color="yellow">Has the king died already?</font>

183
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,520
<font color="yellow">The king...</font>

184
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,170
<font color="yellow">has asked for more tea.</font>

185
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,900
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince Moo is in Chahyeon.</font>

186
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,870
<font color="yellow">You will not be able to
get him here on your own.</font>

187
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,720
<font color="yellow">You want to become king just
to win over someone's heart?</font>

188
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,810
<font color="yellow">The throne is not a seat
to trifle with in that way.</font>

189
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,460
<font color="yellow">To me, that is all it is.</font>

190
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,500
<font color="yellow">Open up the road.</font>

191
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,760
<font color="yellow">If you do not do so,
I will assume you are plotting treason.</font>

192
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,410
<font color="yellow">I am only stopping people from traveling
to prevent treason while the king is ill.</font>

193
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,420
<font color="yellow">I can't open the road for a person when
I don't know who he will bring back.</font>

194
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,820
<font color="yellow">There are no exceptions. Please return.</font>

195
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,770
<font color="yellow">You ruined everything.</font>

196
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,480
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for you,
I would've killed the king.</font>

197
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,100
<font color="yellow">Did you pretend to be a gisaeng
this whole time just to kill the king?</font>

198
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,500
<font color="yellow">You are a very scary girl.</font>

199
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,570
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

200
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,140
<font color="yellow">What kind of deep grudge did you have
that you would do that?</font>

201
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,380
<font color="yellow">Your father...</font>

202
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,640
<font color="yellow">killed my family.</font>

203
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,090
<font color="yellow">All of them.</font>

204
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,050
<font color="yellow">I was the only one left.</font>

205
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,790
<font color="yellow">All of them.</font>

206
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,320
<font color="yellow">Is that why you have
the scars on your wrist?</font>

207
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,680
<font color="yellow">Because of my father?</font>

208
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,930
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

209
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,050
<font color="yellow">I will beg in his place.</font>

210
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,120
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

211
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,790
<font color="yellow">I am sorry for being his son.</font>

212
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,190
<font color="yellow">I have to assume that the king
must be dead by now.</font>

213
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,050
<font color="yellow">Or he is very close to it.</font>

214
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,770
<font color="yellow">Then, will the Crown Prince
take his place on the throne?</font>

215
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,620
<font color="yellow">Oh, good thing you're here.</font>

216
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,730
<font color="yellow">Do you have any news about Cheondeokjeon?</font>

217
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,730
<font color="yellow">Has the king died, by any chance?</font>

218
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,430
<font color="yellow">Don't speak so carelessly.</font>

219
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,610
<font color="yellow">He must have more energy now after
drinking tea from the Damiwon.</font>

220
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,820
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

221
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,950
<font color="yellow">Are you certain?</font>

222
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,310
<font color="yellow">Then why is he holding
the queens hostage?</font>

223
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,490
<font color="yellow">Hostage?</font>

224
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,790
<font color="yellow">Have they not returned
from Cheondeokjeon?</font>

225
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,340
<font color="yellow">They are likely keeping them there
to keep news from leaking out.</font>

226
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,480
<font color="yellow">I will go back there.</font>

227
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,930
<font color="yellow">By the way, where did you hear
about the Damiwon?</font>

228
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,800
<font color="yellow">Who said that tea was served?</font>

229
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,080
<font color="yellow">They said that the king was getting
his appetite back with Hae Soo's tea.</font>

230
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,990
<font color="yellow">She served him tea
both last night and today.</font>

231
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,500
<font color="yellow">Find that girl.</font>

232
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,200
<font color="yellow">That girl is the only one
who knows the condition of the king.</font>

233
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,310
<font color="yellow">We have to stop her from telling
the Crown Prince about the king.</font>

234
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,660
<font color="yellow">Find her. Now!</font>

235
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,070
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Hae Soo?</font>

236
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,380
<font color="yellow">I don't know her.</font>

237
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,200
<font color="yellow">You know, that water maid
from the Gyobang.</font>

238
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,120
<font color="yellow">Why don't you know her?</font>

239
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,140
<font color="yellow">The king has passed away.</font>

240
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

241
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,440
<font color="yellow">When I last saw him,
he was just about to die.</font>

242
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,130
<font color="yellow">By now...</font>

243
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,550
<font color="yellow">He told me to bring the Crown Prince
without anyone finding out.</font>

244
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,320
<font color="yellow">The 3rd Prince is going to attack
Cheondeokjeon tomorrow.</font>

245
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,370
<font color="yellow">You need to bring the Crown Prince
and stop him.</font>

246
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,680
<font color="yellow">How do you know this?</font>

247
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,910
<font color="yellow">Is that what's important right now?</font>

248
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,820
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince is in Hubaekje.</font>

249
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,090
<font color="yellow">All the roads out of Songak are blocked.</font>

250
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,360
<font color="yellow">We need to find another way out.</font>

251
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,360
<font color="yellow">You said Hubaekje?</font>

252
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,670
<font color="yellow">I know someone who might know the way.</font>

253
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,250
<font color="yellow">Because the king has passed out,
no one is left who will recognize you.</font>

254
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,890
<font color="yellow">Would it be wrong to ask you
to forget everything and be with me?</font>

255
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,090
<font color="yellow">Woo Hee!</font>

256
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,230
<font color="yellow">You said your hometown
is Hubaekje, right?</font>

257
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,930
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly asking?</font>

258
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,900
<font color="yellow">We need to go get the Crown Prince.</font>

259
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,000
<font color="yellow">- What?
- How can I trust this girl?</font>

260
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,550
<font color="yellow">She's my friend. You can trust her.</font>

261
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,090
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it is,
but she is all right.</font>

262
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,710
<font color="yellow">It seems the king has passed away.</font>

263
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,780
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

264
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,480
<font color="yellow">Are you positive?</font>

265
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,830
<font color="yellow">We have to assume it.</font>

266
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,470
<font color="yellow">Soon, Yo and Wook...</font>

267
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,870
<font color="yellow">they will attack Cheondeokjeon
to go after the throne.</font>

268
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,380
<font color="yellow">I will stop them,
so you go get the Crown Prince.</font>

269
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,740
<font color="yellow">It should take two days.</font>

270
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,950
<font color="yellow">Wook has blocked all the roads out.</font>

271
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,620
<font color="yellow">There is a road in and out of Songak
that only I know.</font>

272
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,940
<font color="yellow">If So was trying to leave Songak,
he was going to get the Crown Prince.</font>

273
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,500
<font color="yellow">You don't think the king
has already died, do you?</font>

274
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,750
<font color="yellow">I don't know yet.</font>

275
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,380
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard from Mother,
who is inside Cheondeokjeon.</font>

276
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,510
<font color="yellow">So, no one knows the king's condition.</font>

277
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,900
<font color="yellow">This is an opportunity.</font>

278
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,770
<font color="yellow">Attack Cheondeokjeon now
and get Mother out.</font>

279
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,400
<font color="yellow">Announce that the king decreed
you to be the next king.</font>

280
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,070
<font color="yellow">No one will be able to refute it.</font>

281
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,410
<font color="yellow">You have no fear.</font>

282
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,320
<font color="yellow">You want to alter the king's last decree?</font>

283
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,910
<font color="yellow">We can't lose everything
while pondering for too long.</font>

284
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,070
<font color="yellow">I told you already.</font>

285
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,160
<font color="yellow">I do not want to become king
with people calling me a traitor.</font>

286
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,110
<font color="yellow">I do not want anyone to
pick at my weaknesses.</font>

287
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,760
<font color="yellow">I do not want any flaws.</font>

288
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,180
<font color="yellow">I don't know what
your true intentions are.</font>

289
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,030
<font color="yellow">You wore your armor when you
entered the palace yesterday.</font>

290
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,770
<font color="yellow">I thought you were
on the same side as Yo</font>

291
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,410
<font color="yellow">but you will not kill the Crown Prince.</font>

292
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,890
<font color="yellow">I am confused.</font>

293
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,830
<font color="yellow">I am prioritizing.</font>

294
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,500
<font color="yellow">Who would be more advantageous
to attack first?</font>

295
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,090
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince or my third brother?</font>

296
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,000
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

297
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,480
<font color="yellow">I cannot make a single mistake
on my path to the throne.</font>

298
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,470
<font color="yellow">You have changed, Wook.</font>

299
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,070
<font color="yellow">You're not being forcefully dragged.</font>

300
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,100
<font color="yellow">You seem to sincerely
want the throne now.</font>

301
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,690
<font color="yellow">I am happy.</font>

302
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,620
<font color="yellow">If the situation will not change,
then I must change.</font>

303
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,250
<font color="yellow">The thing that worries me most now...</font>

304
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,500
<font color="yellow">is the betrayal of one person.</font>

305
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,270
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you want to sit in it?</font>

306
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

307
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,120
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

308
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,470
<font color="yellow">Everyone risks their lives for that seat.</font>

309
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,870
<font color="yellow">You don't like it?</font>

310
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,630
<font color="yellow">The king threw Court Lady Oh aside
in order to protect that seat.</font>

311
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,280
<font color="yellow">And you, Your Highness...</font>

312
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,510
<font color="yellow">will have to fight your brothers.</font>

313
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,840
<font color="yellow">It is a scary seat.</font>

314
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,430
<font color="yellow">Even if you fight tomorrow</font>

315
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,640
<font color="yellow">you won't hurt them, right?</font>

316
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,920
<font color="yellow">Are you worried about Wook?</font>

317
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,050
<font color="yellow">I guess you still
consider him a relative.</font>

318
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,930
<font color="yellow">Then why did you come to me?</font>

319
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,700
<font color="yellow">You could have just stood by and watched.</font>

320
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,550
<font color="yellow">He said it was for my sake.</font>

321
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,920
<font color="yellow">He was angry that he could not
do anything when I got kicked out.</font>

322
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,630
<font color="yellow">He couldn't help
and had to leave me alone.</font>

323
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,270
<font color="yellow">He says he wants more power.</font>

324
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,730
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

325
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,960
<font color="yellow">I felt that way back then too.</font>

326
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,320
<font color="yellow">The king told me to live my life
rationally and according to reason.</font>

327
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,040
<font color="yellow">That is why I am siding
with the Crown Prince.</font>

328
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,200
<font color="yellow">But if the 8th Prince
were to get injured...</font>

329
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,090
<font color="yellow">I would be scarred forever.</font>

330
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,810
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

331
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,130
<font color="yellow">I can't be confident about it,
but I will try.</font>

332
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,060
<font color="yellow">I don't want Wook to die either.</font>

333
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,830
<font color="yellow">I could die too.</font>

334
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,110
<font color="yellow">Are you not worried about me?</font>

335
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,252
<font color="yellow"><i>You are Gwangjong.</i></font>

336
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,980
<font color="yellow"><i>You have a long history ahead of you.</i></font>

337
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,750
<font color="yellow">Even people who don't seem like they'll ever die...</font>

338
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,258
<font color="yellow">eventually die.</font>

339
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,740
<font color="yellow">You will be fine, Your Highness.</font>

340
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,690
<font color="yellow">I don't know much else,
but I'm sure about that.</font>

341
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,820
<font color="yellow">Get away.</font>

342
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,070
<font color="yellow">He is mine. Do not touch him.</font>

343
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,730
<font color="yellow">His Majesty would not like
you acting this way.</font>

344
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,920
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

345
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,970
<font color="yellow">Have you ever even been loved by him?</font>

346
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,120
<font color="yellow">Move that hand!</font>

347
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,480
<font color="yellow">Please do not get caught up
in your emotions and cause a scene.</font>

348
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,400
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

349
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,190
<font color="yellow">I would like to see him briefly.</font>

350
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,470
<font color="yellow">How did you get in here?</font>

351
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,620
<font color="yellow">What about Yo? Is Jung here?</font>

352
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,380
<font color="yellow">His last words were...</font>

353
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,240
<font color="yellow">that life is short.</font>

354
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,150
<font color="yellow">He said life was short and fleeting.</font>

355
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,400
<font color="yellow">And fleeting, yet again.</font>

356
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,860
<font color="yellow"><i>[Two years earlier, Shinju]</i></font>

357
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,460
<font color="yellow">The king must think sending a mask
every year is enough fatherly affection.</font>

358
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,430
<font color="yellow">Ji Mong.</font>

359
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,140
<font color="yellow">How many men and weapons
does Cheondeokjeon have?</font>

360
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,430
<font color="yellow">Go check with Grand General Park.</font>

361
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,970
<font color="yellow">Once the sun comes up...</font>

362
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,730
<font color="yellow">3rd Prince Yo and 8th Prince Wook
will be raising a rebellion.</font>

363
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,560
<font color="yellow">The king wished to hand the throne
to the Crown Prince.</font>

364
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,690
<font color="yellow">We should make that happen.</font>

365
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,770
<font color="yellow">I will go talk to Grand General Park.</font>

366
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,370
<font color="yellow">Did you really just say Wook?</font>

367
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,040
<font color="yellow">I think I must have heard wrong.</font>

368
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,760
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

369
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,120
<font color="yellow">A rebellion? What about Yo?</font>

370
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,770
<font color="yellow">Yes. He is probably coming for me.</font>

371
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,370
<font color="yellow">He is coming to see why you all
have me locked up in here.</font>

372
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,100
<font color="yellow">Do not harm Yo.</font>

373
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,860
<font color="yellow">If you touch one hair on his body,
I will kill you myself.</font>

374
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,550
<font color="yellow">You expect him to live
after committing treason?</font>

375
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,200
<font color="yellow">You are too greedy.</font>

376
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,560
<font color="yellow">Leave my son alone!</font>

377
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,010
<font color="yellow">What do you mean treason? What treason?</font>

378
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,880
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.
Why are you being stupid?</font>

379
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,390
<font color="yellow">With one wrong move,
your son and mine will both die.</font>

380
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,730
<font color="yellow">We need to come up with
a plan to save our children.</font>

381
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,050
<font color="yellow">Forget that you're a woman
and remember that you are a mother.</font>

382
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,270
<font color="yellow">Understand?</font>

383
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,530
<font color="yellow">Whoa!</font>

384
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,950
<font color="yellow">We need to keep going.</font>

385
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,270
<font color="yellow">We need to take a break
in order to arrive a bit earlier.</font>

386
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,820
<font color="yellow">If we keep going like this,
your wound will open up more.</font>

387
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,740
<font color="yellow">We might not arrive at all.</font>

388
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,994
<font color="yellow">I wasn't trying to hide that
I was a prince from the beginning.</font>

389
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,597
<font color="yellow">I wasn't trying to fool you.</font>

390
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,660
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

391
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,380
<font color="yellow">You're not like that.</font>

392
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,290
<font color="yellow">I hid things from you too.</font>

393
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,790
<font color="yellow">We're even.</font>

394
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,790
<font color="yellow">I could just be a musician
and you could be a gisaeng.</font>

395
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,160
<font color="yellow">I wonder what it would've been like
if that were true.</font>

396
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,790
<font color="yellow">If so...</font>

397
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,400
<font color="yellow">would we have an entirely
different relationship?</font>

398
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,960
<font color="yellow">Rest up a little more.</font>

399
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,200
<font color="yellow">We just need to cross one mountain.</font>

400
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,240
<font color="yellow">Then... we will be in Hubaekje.</font>

401
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,380
<font color="yellow">It's my hometown.</font>

402
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,970
<font color="yellow">We will have to part ways tomorrow.</font>

403
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,960
<font color="yellow">We won't have a reason to meet again.</font>

404
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,030
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

405
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,750
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

406
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,130
<font color="yellow">I guess that's how you feel.</font>

407
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,100
<font color="yellow">Since we won't see
each other again, then...</font>

408
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,800
<font color="yellow">can I do whatever I want for tonight?</font>

409
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,900
<font color="yellow">It's strangely too quiet.</font>

410
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,210
<font color="yellow">It's as if they are expecting us.</font>

411
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,550
<font color="yellow">Most of the military is out
with the Crown Prince.</font>

412
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,530
<font color="yellow">There are not many soldiers left.</font>

413
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,340
<font color="yellow">Even if they were to come back now,
it would take them a whole day.</font>

414
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,820
<font color="yellow">I have a request to ask of you.</font>

415
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,880
<font color="yellow">What is it? Ask me anything.</font>

416
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,460
<font color="yellow">If 4th Prince So tries to stop us...</font>

417
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,510
<font color="yellow">please make sure to kill him.</font>

418
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,180
<font color="yellow">There's no need to request that of me.</font>

419
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,390
<font color="yellow">I will make sure to kill him.</font>

420
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,890
<font color="yellow">You dare to bring an army to
a place where the king lives?</font>

421
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,900
<font color="yellow">This is treason!</font>

422
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,790
<font color="yellow">My mother has been in there
for over a day.</font>

423
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,230
<font color="yellow">I need to know the truth behind why
Cheondeokjeon has been sealed off.</font>

424
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,860
<font color="yellow">I have told you that
the king needs his rest.</font>

425
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,540
<font color="yellow">Do you think I would believe
such an blatant lie?</font>

426
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,680
<font color="yellow">Let my mother out now</font>

427
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,250
<font color="yellow">or I have to assume
you're pushing out the Crown Prince.</font>

428
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,800
<font color="yellow">And you are planning to
take over the throne.</font>

429
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,560
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince!</font>

430
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,670
<font color="yellow">Wook, go to Cheondeokjeon now.</font>

431
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,460
<font color="yellow">You're going to betray me now?</font>

432
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,450
<font color="yellow">We were never on the same side,
so it is not betrayal.</font>

433
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,220
<font color="yellow">I heard about your plan from Wook.</font>

434
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,200
<font color="yellow">I was on my way back
after receiving a letter.</font>

435
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,520
<font color="yellow">Wook, you proved your loyalty this time.</font>

436
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,010
<font color="yellow">It was my honor, Crown Prince.</font>

437
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,900
<font color="yellow">So, it was a trap to catch me?</font>

438
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,900
<font color="yellow">His Majesty...</font>

439
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,800
<font color="yellow">has just died.</font>

440
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,640
<font color="yellow">He has left a decree stating that
Crown Prince Moo shall be the next king.</font>

441
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,040
<font color="yellow">The queens have acknowledged
and received the decree.</font>

442
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,250
<font color="yellow">I deliver this message to you,
Your Highnesses!</font>

443
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,150
<font color="yellow">Father...</font>

444
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,740
<font color="yellow">Greetings to the new king, Your Majesty.</font>

445
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,850
<font color="yellow">Long live the king! Long live the king!</font>

446
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,500
<font color="yellow">Greetings to the king, Your Majesty.</font>

447
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,470
<font color="yellow">Long live the king! Long live the king!</font>

448
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,130
<font color="yellow">What are you all doing?</font>

449
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,830
<font color="yellow">Greet your new king!</font>

450
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,400
<font color="yellow">Long live the king! Long live the king!</font>

451
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,470
<font color="yellow">Is he really dead?</font>

452
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,220
<font color="yellow">I cannot believe it.</font>

453
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,590
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

454
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,920
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

455
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,220
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

456
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,650
<font color="yellow"><i>Wait and see, Your Majesty.</i></font>

457
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,240
<font color="yellow"><i>You always thought I was too ambitious.</i></font>

458
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,270
<font color="yellow"><i>I, Yeon Hwa, will make this empire mine.</i></font>

459
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,350
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

460
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,790
<font color="yellow">We must go now and say
our last goodbyes to the king.</font>

461
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,800
<font color="yellow">You cannot go to the palace.</font>

462
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,180
<font color="yellow">You are very sick right now.</font>

463
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,220
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I'm not sick.</font>

464
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,570
<font color="yellow">You're so deathly ill
that you can't go to the funeral.</font>

465
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,830
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to attend
when the new king is enthroned.</font>

466
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,030
<font color="yellow">That way... that way, you can live.</font>

467
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,780
<font color="yellow">Why would I die?
Explain it so I understand.</font>

468
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,070
<font color="yellow">Do you know what a new king does
once he gets on the throne?</font>

469
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,510
<font color="yellow">He kills off all male siblings and
nephews who will threaten his position.</font>

470
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,050
<font color="yellow">Kill?</font>

471
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,710
<font color="yellow">You need stay as silent as a mouse
if you want to live.</font>

472
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,990
<font color="yellow">You need to make the new king
completely forget about us.</font>

473
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,770
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving me your armor?</font>

474
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,060
<font color="yellow">You want me to wear my wife's armor
to save my own life?</font>

475
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,980
<font color="yellow">I noticed that you tend to
look down on your husband.</font>

476
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,590
<font color="yellow">Then... should we die together?</font>

477
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,360
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Why would I die with you?</font>

478
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,910
<font color="yellow">Why should we die at all?</font>

479
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,770
<font color="yellow">Let's both... live.</font>

480
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,710
<font color="yellow">Life and death are matters of luck.
I'd rather not die together.</font>

481
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,100
<font color="yellow">We are married,
so we shouldn't die alone.</font>

482
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,560
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

483
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,330
<font color="yellow">You were on the Crown Prince's side.</font>

484
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,040
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie to me like that?</font>

485
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,750
<font color="yellow">You did it on purpose, right?</font>

486
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,460
<font color="yellow">You were testing me.</font>

487
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,510
<font color="yellow">And... you went to So in the end.</font>

488
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:28,810
<font color="yellow">You weren't planning to
kill the 4th Prince, were you?</font>

489
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,710
<font color="yellow">It was not a lie that
I plan on becoming the king.</font>

490
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,020
<font color="yellow">Nothing bad will come from getting rid
of those who will get in my way later.</font>

491
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,460
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

492
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,480
<font color="yellow">I was the cause of what happened
to Court Lady Oh.</font>

493
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,380
<font color="yellow">You knew how much pain that caused me.</font>

494
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,660
<font color="yellow">Yet, you were going to use me
to kill the 4th Prince?</font>

495
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,540
<font color="yellow">You have changed.</font>

496
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,090
<font color="yellow">You are not the person I once knew.</font>

497
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,640
<font color="yellow">What about you?
Why did you hide the truth from me?</font>

498
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,720
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to tell me
that the king had died.</font>

499
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,890
<font color="yellow">Didn't you care if I would die or not?</font>

500
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:21,480
<font color="yellow">The king asked me to help the
Crown Prince become the next king.</font>

501
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,750
<font color="yellow">That was what was logical.</font>

502
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,230
<font color="yellow">I could not go against that and...</font>

503
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,790
<font color="yellow">the 4th Prince had promised
that he would not kill you.</font>

504
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:42,040
<font color="yellow">You pleaded for my life with So?</font>

505
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,100
<font color="yellow">You said to me before.</font>

506
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,930
<font color="yellow">That we should leave Songak
and leave in peace.</font>

507
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,580
<font color="yellow">I can do that now.</font>

508
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,750
<font color="yellow">If you ask the new king,
he will allow it.</font>

509
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,930
<font color="yellow">Even if we do that,
another problem will arise.</font>

510
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,110
<font color="yellow">There is no other way.</font>

511
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,440
<font color="yellow">You said you were doing this for me.</font>

512
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,660
<font color="yellow">You are fooling yourself.</font>

513
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,610
<font color="yellow">Now...</font>

514
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,660
<font color="yellow">I cannot have the same feelings for you
as I did in the past, Your Highness.</font>

515
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,830
<font color="yellow">I want to keep my distance from you.</font>

516
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,620
<font color="yellow">Is it because of the 4th Prince?</font>

517
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,620
<font color="yellow">For even one moment...</font>

518
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,540
<font color="yellow">have you ever been sure
of my feelings for you?</font>

519
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,900
<font color="yellow">Have you ever completely trusted me?</font>

520
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,840
<font color="yellow">I will make you come back to me.</font>

521
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,140
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

522
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,190
<font color="yellow">Don't hunt him like he's an animal.</font>

523
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,670
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. I can convince him.</font>

524
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,730
<font color="yellow">Don't do it.</font>

525
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,660
<font color="yellow">Can you handle him until the end?</font>

526
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,680
<font color="yellow">He is still your older brother.</font>

527
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,280
<font color="yellow">Give up already.</font>

528
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,680
<font color="yellow">If it were you, would you give up?</font>

529
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,810

530
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,670

532
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,860
<font color="yellow">It is not possible.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why would Yo?</font>

535
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,120
<font color="yellow">This would not happen to me.</font>

536
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,630
<font color="yellow">I will find him.</font>

537
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,180

540

00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,420
