I have a question for you.</i></font>

00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:34,040
<font color="yellow"><i>Can you forget that your wife
was held by another guy?</i></font>

6
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,643
<font color="yellow"><i>Of course.</i></font>

7
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:51,265
<font color="yellow"><i>I can forget it.</i></font>

8
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:53,400
<font color="yellow"><i>I can forgive her.</i></font>

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,250
<font color="yellow"><i>No. I have already forgiven her.</i></font>

10
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,779
<font color="yellow">Forgive her?</font>

11
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,077
<font color="yellow">I told you not to forgive her.</font>

12
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:36,035
<font color="yellow"><i>All right. Forgive her, and live as
a moron for the rest of your life.</i></font>

13
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,895
<font color="yellow">- Geez.
- What? What is it?</font>

14
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:45,249
<font color="yellow">- Let me see.
- That's great. Great.</font>

15
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:48,046
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean that's great?
- Oh my.</font>

16
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:49,951
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

17
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,472
<font color="yellow"><i>Toycrane, you can't do this.</i></font>

18
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:58,279
<font color="yellow"><i>You should never forgive her.</i></font>

get hurt. A traitor has to go to hell.</i></font>

00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:04,681
<font color="yellow">It has been a while.</font>

21
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,097
<font color="yellow">Just the two of us, drinking together...</font>

22
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:10,075
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

23
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:13,077
<font color="yellow">How are things going at work?</font>

24
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:16,555
<font color="yellow">I don't do identity work that
much these days.</font>

25
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:19,217
<font color="yellow">I'm focusing on making brochures.</font>

26
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:21,675
<font color="yellow">So I'm not that busy.</font>

27
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,708
<font color="yellow">It's been a while. Let's toast.</font>

28
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:34,057
<font color="yellow"><i>I got some information about
that flirtatious wife.</i></font>

29
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,219
<font color="yellow"><i>She's a graphic designer.</i></font>

30
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:43,143
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, what are you looking for?</font>

31
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:45,343
<font color="yellow">Where did you put my crayons?</font>

32
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:49,503
<font color="yellow">- Crayons?
- Crayons...</font>

33
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:54,643
<font color="yellow">I'll find them for you.</font>

34
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:59,135
<font color="yellow">It's right here. I found your crayons.
Ta da.</font>

35
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,494
<font color="yellow">Oh. Isn't this a telescope?</font>

36
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:08,458
<font color="yellow">Wow, he still has this?</font>

37
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,384
<font color="yellow">Wow, it looks so fancy.</font>

38
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:13,656
<font color="yellow">That's right. Producer Do was part of
the Telescope Team in college, right?</font>

39
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:17,664
<font color="yellow">Yes. Soo Yeon was part of the Telescope
Team, and Hyun Woo followed her.</font>

40
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,118
<font color="yellow">Wow. I can see your pores very clearly--</font>

41
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,313
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

42
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,079
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

43
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,301
<font color="yellow">2008. 11. 27?</font>

44
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:32,238
<font color="yellow">November 27 is Mom's birthday.</font>

45
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:34,474
<font color="yellow">Is tomorrow your mom's birthday?</font>

46
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,867
<font color="yellow">Were you drawing that to give it
to her as her birthday gift?</font>

47
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:50,547
<font color="yellow">It's all done.</font>

48
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:53,327
<font color="yellow">Your mom will be so happy
when she sees this.</font>

49
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,196
<font color="yellow">It would be great if your dad,
mom, and you</font>

50
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:57,063
<font color="yellow">could celebrate her birthday
together tomorrow, right?</font>

51
00:03:57,063 --> 00:04:00,619
<font color="yellow">Yes, that would be so nice.</font>

52
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:05,365
<font color="yellow">Are you going to put that
up on the wall?</font>

53
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:07,597
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

54
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,618
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo might get disappointed.</font>

55
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:12,593
<font color="yellow">- So we can't disappoint him.
- How can we not disappoint him?</font>

56
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:15,034
<font color="yellow">You and I have to work together.</font>

57
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:17,491
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, let's go to bed.</font>

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,808
<font color="yellow">Is he sleeping?</font>

59
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:26,873
<font color="yellow">It's much better to not have you around
when I'm putting him to bed.</font>

60
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:29,224
<font color="yellow">This is what I learned from
babysitting Joon Soo.</font>

61
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:31,534
<font color="yellow">I can see why people say
moms are the greatest.</font>

62
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,936
<font color="yellow">That's right. They are the greatest.</font>

63
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:40,635
<font color="yellow">- Don't you want to be the greatest too?
- In my next life maybe?</font>

64
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:42,537
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Woo is here.
- You're here.</font>

65
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,553
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm here.</font>

66
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:47,459
<font color="yellow">- What about Joon Soo?
- He's sleeping.</font>

67
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,923
<font color="yellow">Is he sleeping? Thanks guys.
Babysitting for two days...</font>

68
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,508
<font color="yellow">- Are you guys tired?
- Do you know what day tomorrow is?</font>

69
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:57,488
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow? What about tomorrow?</font>

70
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,935
<font color="yellow">- Do you really not know?
- What?</font>

71
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:02,602
<font color="yellow">This means you missed it every year.</font>

72
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,007
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow is Soo Yeon's birthday.</font>

73
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:09,303
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo remembers it. He even drew
something to give to her as a present.</font>

74
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:12,409
<font color="yellow">That's right. Today is the 26th.</font>

75
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:16,118
<font color="yellow">Buy some flowers and a cake
when you come home tomorrow.</font>

76
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:19,710
<font color="yellow">We're not living together.
Do you think she'd come here?</font>

77
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,904
<font color="yellow">She'll be here. For Joon Soo's sake...</font>

78
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:25,561
<font color="yellow">Since you're here, we'll get going.
Let's go Writer Kwon.</font>

79
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:29,262
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, and thank you guys.
I will buy you guys a fancy meal later.</font>

80
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,226
<font color="yellow">- Take a rest.
- We will get going.</font>

81
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,096
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

82
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,584
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hungry?
Should we go grab something to eat?</font>

83
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:40,828
<font color="yellow">It is a perfect day to eat
roasted clam with soju.</font>

84
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:42,503
<font color="yellow">But I'm too tired. Let's just head home.</font>

85
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:45,121
<font color="yellow">- Why? Let's go eat.
- I'm tired.</font>

86
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:47,621
<font color="yellow">Please wake me up when we get home.</font>

87
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,472
<font color="yellow">You are being disrespectful
to the driver.</font>

88
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:52,626
<font color="yellow">Why would you call this
a passenger seat?</font>

89
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,714
<font color="yellow">You have to talk and run errands
for the driver--</font>

90
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:58,238
<font color="yellow">Why? Why? Why?
Hey, Writer Kwon.</font>

91
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:04,988
<font color="yellow">Are you happy now?
Wake me up when we get home.</font>

92
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:09,534
<font color="yellow">She never gives me a break.
Okay. Let's go.</font>

93
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:14,412
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, wake up. We are here.</font>

94
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,863
<font color="yellow">The wind tastes salty?</font>

95
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:28,371
<font color="yellow">It feels like we're at the beach--</font>

96
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,575
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

97
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:36,811
<font color="yellow">- Where are we?
- I had hard time driving here.</font>

98
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:39,316
<font color="yellow">- Did you just kidnap me?
- Kidnap?</font>

99
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,938
<font color="yellow">You said you want to eat roasted clam.</font>

100
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:44,269
<font color="yellow">You said we must eat it at the beach.</font>

101
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:47,291
<font color="yellow">That's what you said on our way here.</font>

102
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,897
<font color="yellow">Forget it. If you don't want to eat it,
I'm going to eat alone.</font>

103
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:53,654
<font color="yellow">- How could you change your words...
- Producer Ann.</font>

104
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:58,399
<font color="yellow">There's a famous restaurant.
It's this way.</font>

105
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:10,250
<font color="yellow">Oh my. It's hot.</font>

106
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,239
<font color="yellow">This is the downside of
eating roasted clam.</font>

107
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:16,109
<font color="yellow">I'm in a war, trying to save
some roasted clams.</font>

108
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:18,604
<font color="yellow">- Is it done?
- Wait.</font>

109
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:24,647
<font color="yellow">You can't eat that yet.</font>

110
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,383
<font color="yellow">I can just sterilize it.</font>

111
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:29,645
<font color="yellow">What would you have done
if I hadn't brought you here?</font>

112
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:31,335
<font color="yellow">Don't even try to trick me
again like this.</font>

113
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:34,066
<font color="yellow">Trick you? This is what you said earlier.</font>

114
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:36,758
<font color="yellow">You have to eat roasted clam at the beach
if you want to really enjoy it.</font>

115
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,294
<font color="yellow">- Did I say that?
- Gosh.</font>

116
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:42,650
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's be honest.
Why did you say that to me?</font>

117
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,267
<font color="yellow">I don't even remember. I guess I was
just talking to myself.</font>

118
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,251
<font color="yellow">Don't pretend like you don't remember it.</font>

119
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:51,171
<font color="yellow">You were clearly trying to say
"Joon Young, take me to the beach."</font>

120
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,863
<font color="yellow">That's what you were trying to say.</font>

121
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,638
<font color="yellow">Ask anyone out there...</font>

122
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:59,998
<font color="yellow">"Joon Young, I want to eat roasted clam
so let's go to the beach together."</font>

123
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,570
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Yes.</font>

124
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,147
<font color="yellow">- I said no.
- I said yes.</font>

125
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:06,334
<font color="yellow">- No.
- He is right.</font>

126
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:12,051
<font color="yellow">I think what he says is right.</font>

127
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:16,438
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that mean
"Let's go to the beach together?"</font>

128
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:18,301
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

129
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:22,142
<font color="yellow">Based on what you guys just said,
she likes him.</font>

130
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:24,524
<font color="yellow">How could you take it that far?</font>

131
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,945
<font color="yellow">When I was dating my wife</font>

132
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:29,166
<font color="yellow">She wanted to go to the beach.</font>

133
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,717
<font color="yellow">That's how we got married.</font>

134
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:36,819
<font color="yellow">- This is driving me crazy.
- I will put an end to this.</font>

135
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:39,388
<font color="yellow">I had a bad cold.</font>

136
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:42,241
<font color="yellow">And she bought me medicine.</font>

137
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:45,211
<font color="yellow">It's done. That's my favorite part.</font>

138
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:48,533
<font color="yellow">It's the best when she takes care of
you when you are sick.</font>

139
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:53,164
<font color="yellow">That means it's okay if I'm sick,
but I can't watch you suffer.</font>

140
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:56,308
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure why I have to</font>

141
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:59,090
<font color="yellow">explain to those guys about
that incident.</font>

142
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,858
<font color="yellow">I got tired of him sniffling
during our meeting</font>

143
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:06,270
<font color="yellow">so I gave him the medicine.
It was the one that I took before.</font>

144
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,303
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't give it to him
if you don't like him.</font>

145
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:10,896
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

146
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:15,129
<font color="yellow">You guys speak the truth.</font>

147
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:19,653
<font color="yellow">Look at her. She is a bit aggressive.</font>

148
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:22,121
<font color="yellow">I think you guys are
a match made in heaven.</font>

149
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,468
<font color="yellow">Sir, even if he was the only man in
in this universe</font>

150
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:27,727
<font color="yellow">I couldn't date him. Because--</font>

151
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:32,254
<font color="yellow">Men are all garbage.</font>

152
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:35,342
<font color="yellow">Sister, men are all garbage.</font>

153
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:41,562
<font color="yellow">After he sleeps with you,
he will change his mind.</font>

154
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:44,155
<font color="yellow">I finally found someone
who can understand me.</font>

155
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:47,795
<font color="yellow">- Can I join you?
- Come here. Join me.</font>

156
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,091
<font color="yellow">- Let's have a drink.
- Great.</font>

157
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,044
<font color="yellow">Drink.</font>

158
00:09:52,044 --> 00:09:57,049
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
- Do you really think I would do that?</font>

159
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,606
<font color="yellow">Oh, he is handsome.</font>

160
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:02,036
<font color="yellow">You're the worst.</font>

161
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,622
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

162
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:06,712
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you guys think I'm a garbage?</font>

163
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:08,818
<font color="yellow">- No.
- No.</font>

164
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:14,462
<font color="yellow">This is what the life is all about.</font>

165
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:17,567
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
- Cheers.</font>

166
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,241
<font color="yellow">Drink it.</font>

167
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:24,659
<font color="yellow">I used to be pretty too.</font>

168
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,990
<font color="yellow">How did I become...</font>

169
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,441
<font color="yellow">so lame?</font>

170
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,823
<font color="yellow">You were pretty back in the day.</font>

171
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:38,305
<font color="yellow">You're still pretty, but
you seem like an old single man.</font>

172
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,555
<font color="yellow">But you can change that.</font>

173
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:45,784
<font color="yellow">Pig? Did you just say I'm a pig?</font>

174
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:50,425
<font color="yellow">Sir, can I order some pork rinds?</font>

175
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:53,172
<font color="yellow">What is going on here? Why would you eat
pork rinds at the beach?</font>

176
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,198
<font color="yellow">Pork rind?</font>

177
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,994
<font color="yellow">Sir, do you have pork rind here?</font>

178
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,786
<font color="yellow">We sell roasted clam here,
why would we have pork rind?</font>

179
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,577
<font color="yellow">You guys are all drunk.</font>

180
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,456
<font color="yellow">You guys should go home.</font>

181
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,245
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Go.</font>

182
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:10,159
<font color="yellow">- Drink some more.
- No, I'm not going.</font>

183
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,731
<font color="yellow">- I'm not going.
- You are--</font>

184
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,727
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

185
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:24,410
<font color="yellow">Honey, when did you get back?</font>

186
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,289
<font color="yellow">A while ago.</font>

187
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:31,475
<font color="yellow">Why did you come back all of sudden?</font>

188
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,501
<font color="yellow">You should have called me.
I would have waited for you.</font>

189
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,597
<font color="yellow">I told you I would be back
by our anniversary.</font>

190
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:38,510
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

191
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,156
<font color="yellow">It's past 12 o'clock already.</font>

192
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:45,980
<font color="yellow"><i>Congratulations.</i></font>

193
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,579
<font color="yellow"><i>Congratulations.</i></font>

194
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,799
<font color="yellow"><i>Congratulations.</i></font>

195
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,826
<font color="yellow"><i>You and I.</i></font>

196
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:59,516
<font color="yellow"><i>Our wedding anniversary.</i></font>

197
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:03,553
<font color="yellow">Honey, let's blow out
the candles together.</font>

198
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:07,471
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

199
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:18,212
<font color="yellow">What is this? Can I take a look?</font>

200
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,192
<font color="yellow">Honey. Isn't this the building
in Seochodong?</font>

201
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:34,521
<font color="yellow">What is this?
The owner of the building is...</font>

202
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,716
<font color="yellow">It says Choi Yoon Ki.</font>

203
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:39,990
<font color="yellow">That's the building that my grandfather
gave to me himself.</font>

204
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,648
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

205
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,467
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can take this.</font>

206
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:48,014
<font color="yellow">I know that you love me.</font>

207
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:53,347
<font color="yellow">I will just take your heart.
I can't take this.</font>

208
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:56,271
<font color="yellow">I was planning on giving this to you.</font>

209
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,764
<font color="yellow">- Take it.
- Gosh.</font>

210
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:02,496
<font color="yellow">This is what your grandfather
gave to you.</font>

211
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:07,509
<font color="yellow">I have to take good care of this.</font>

212
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:11,949
<font color="yellow">You will do great.</font>

213
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:14,265
<font color="yellow">Come in, come in.</font>

214
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:19,298
<font color="yellow"><i>Why did you come to our house?</i></font>

215
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,040
<font color="yellow"><i>I came to drink, drink, and drink.</i></font>

216
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,669
<font color="yellow"><i>What kind do you want to drink?</i></font>

217
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:30,377
<font color="yellow"><i>I came to drink everything.</i></font>

218
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:35,555
<font color="yellow"><i>Drink, drink, drink.</i></font>

219
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:41,874
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

220
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:44,648
<font color="yellow">You drink coffee as if it is
hangover soup.</font>

221
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:47,717
<font color="yellow">I had a drink with Writer Kwon.</font>

222
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:50,864
<font color="yellow">What? Did she abandon you
on the street again?</font>

223
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,010
<font color="yellow">I was at my house when I woke up.</font>

224
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,516
<font color="yellow">You're growing up.</font>

225
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,788
<font color="yellow">Talk with Bo Young and pick a date.</font>

226
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,175
<font color="yellow">I have to buy you guys a meal
for babysitting Joon Soo.</font>

227
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,549
<font color="yellow">I guess you really drank a lot.</font>

228
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
I was thinking about something.</font>

229
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,980
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I can just eat
instant cup ramen.</font>

230
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,447
<font color="yellow">It can hurt your stomach
if you eat ramen.</font>

231
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:30,319
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to do this,
but sorry for causing you trouble.</font>

232
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,773
<font color="yellow">I'm the one causing trouble.</font>

233
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:36,285
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for babysitting Joon Soo.
- Oh.</font>

234
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:39,562
<font color="yellow">It was tiring, right?
Joon Soo is a bit picky.</font>

235
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:43,597
<font color="yellow">That's right.
I think he's like Producer Do.</font>

236
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:46,669
<font color="yellow">Oh, happy birthday.</font>

237
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,351
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

238
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:53,250
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo. He was totally ready
to celebrate your birthday.</font>

239
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:59,765
<font color="yellow">I think it might be best
to go see Joon Soo today.</font>

240
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,100
<font color="yellow">I know I have no right to say this...</font>

241
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,225
<font color="yellow">But if you guys stay like this, it will
make things harder for both of you.</font>

242
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:15,343
<font color="yellow">And more than anything,
I feel bad for Joon Soo.</font>

243
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:18,178
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying this because
I'm tired of babysitting Joon Soo.</font>

244
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:21,279
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

245
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,369
<font color="yellow">I know. Thank you.</font>

246
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:28,115
<font color="yellow">Oh my. It's hot.</font>

247
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:33,346
<font color="yellow">I'm going to finish this.</font>

248
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:49,571

<font color="yellow">- What is it for?
- It's a birthday present.</font>

251

<font color="yellow">Do you want to take a look
at this pamphlet?</font>

252
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,573
<font color="yellow">- I can take it today, right?
- Yes.</font>

253
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,906
<font color="yellow">- Can I include a card too?
- Of course.</font>

254
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,292
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jung Soo Yeon.</font>

255
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:19,635
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Here's your flower basket.</font>

256
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:27,457
<font color="yellow">- It's so pretty.
- She must be so happy.</font>

257
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:30,364
<font color="yellow">Did your husband send it?</font>

258
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,427
<font color="yellow">- He must be a great guy.
- She must be so happy.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>I can't ever forgive the one
who betrayed her family.</i></font>

260

But I can't forgive you.</i></font>

261
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,477
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Team Leader Jung?</font>

262
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,770
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

263
00:16:56,587 --> 00:17:00,005
<font color="yellow">- We should go back to work.
- Okay.</font>

00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:12,630
<font color="yellow">Wow, did you really draw this?</font>

296
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,663
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Joon Soo.</font>

297
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:18,823
<font color="yellow">Dad, give her your present too.</font>

298
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:27,022
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

299
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,053
<font color="yellow">It's nothing special.</font>

300
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:51,256
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- It's nothing.</font>

301
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,246
<font color="yellow">You haven't eat dinner yet, right?</font>

302
00:21:55,246 --> 00:22:00,687
<font color="yellow">- Should we eat out?
- Great.</font>

303
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:04,051
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Let's take this.</font>

304
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:20,045
<font color="yellow">He was excited about your
birthday party all day.</font>

305
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:21,909
<font color="yellow">He must have been tired.</font>

306
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:26,132
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

307
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:33,357
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for always leaving you behind.</font>

308
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:38,401
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. I will get going.</font>

309
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:40,349
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

310
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:43,088
<font color="yellow">What should I say to Joon Soo?</font>

311
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:46,148
<font color="yellow">He thinks you came back home
to stay here.</font>

312
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:49,311
<font color="yellow">I'll call him and talk to him tomorrow.</font>

313
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:51,526
<font color="yellow">Okay then.</font>

314
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:58,129
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

315
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,726
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

316
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:03,268
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

317
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:07,040
<font color="yellow">What? Did something happen?</font>

318
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,975
<font color="yellow">No. I will get going.</font>

319
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:23,015
<font color="yellow"><i>I sent a flower basket

00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:58,524
<font color="yellow">The message board...</font>

327
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,493

329
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:09,834
<font color="yellow">- How is that possible?
- There's a way if you look into it.</font>

330
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,775
<font color="yellow">Some people only use one ID
for all websites.</font>

331

a search engine</font>

332
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,055

333
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:21,809
<font color="yellow">You can find what people wrote
on some website.</font>

334
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,823

on one of those random posts.</font>

335
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:30,328
<font color="yellow">They could have gotten some hints from
the posts you posted earlier.</font>

336
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:32,261
<font color="yellow">If it's not that...</font>

337
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:34,252
<font color="yellow">It's illegal.</font>

338
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:38,938

that is by searching his IP.</font>

339
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:40,892
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

340
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:44,345
<font color="yellow">I think Soo Yeon was very surprised.</font>

342
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,310

those things there</font>

346
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,073
<font color="yellow">Everything will be okay.
I will take care of everything so--</font>

347
00:25:05,073 --> 00:25:07,849
<font color="yellow">What should we do with our Joon Soo?</font>

348
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:11,963
<font color="yellow">It's my fault.
People can point fingers at me.</font>

349
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:14,236

to our Joon Soo.</i></font>

351
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:18,552

<font color="yellow"><i>No. Nothing will happen.</i></font>

353
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,525
<font color="yellow">Nothing will happen to
either Joon Soo or you.</font>

354
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:25,748
<font color="yellow">I promise you. Okay?</font>

355
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:28,140
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't worry.</i></font>

356
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:35,665
<font color="yellow">Why is this on here?</font>

357
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:38,467
<font color="yellow">You must have posted it on the internet.</font>

358
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,649
<font color="yellow">And everyone is allowed to see it.</font>

359
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:44,737
<font color="yellow">So you just searched for my ID
and this is what you found?</font>

360
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:46,581
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

361
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,137
<font color="yellow">- On the flip-side...
- Yes.</font>

362
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:53,313
<font color="yellow">If I know someone's ID, I can
find out who that person is, right?</font>

363
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:55,864
<font color="yellow">Yes, if you get lucky.</font>

364
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:58,610
<font color="yellow">Then search for this ID.</font>

365
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,926
<font color="yellow"><i>[Adultery Patch]</i></font>

366
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:11,544

367
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:14,582
<font color="yellow">I googled it, but nothing popped up.</font>

368
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:17,150

369
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,738
<font color="yellow">The message board? It's the same.
It's clean.</font>

370
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:24,911
<font color="yellow">My stuff is all over the internet,
Why isn't any of his stuff popping up?</font>

371
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:27,128
<font color="yellow">It seems like he just made a new ID.</font>

372
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:30,094
<font color="yellow">What? Can you track IP?</font>

373
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,397
<font color="yellow">- That's illegal.
- Just try it.</font>

374
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:35,353
<font color="yellow">- It's illegal.
- Just do it. Give it a try.</font>

375
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:38,514
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to search
for this ID?</font>

376
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:43,591
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

377
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,851
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay. Okay.</font>

378
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:54,446
<font color="yellow">What did Cyber Crime Department
people say?</font>

379
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,918
<font color="yellow">Since the actual personal information
did not get leaked</font>

380
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:01,640
<font color="yellow">they can't start investigating
with only assumptions.</font>

381
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,777
<font color="yellow">They are not going to tell us who he is?</font>

382
00:27:03,777 --> 00:27:06,791
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean.
This is driving me crazy.</font>

383
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,368
<font color="yellow">Why are these people doing this?</font>

384
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:12,360
<font color="yellow">I heard it seems like he made a new ID.</font>

385
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,928
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

386
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:18,165
<font color="yellow">I think it is one of the people who used
to post things on the message board.</font>

387
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:21,784
<font color="yellow">You know how thieves wear masks
to hide their faces.</font>

388
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:25,322
<font color="yellow">I think he made a new ID
to hide himself.</font>

389
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:27,867
<font color="yellow">What is he thinking?</font>

390
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:32,303
<font color="yellow">He might want to become a hero.
Or he could be doing this for fun.</font>

391
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:36,650
<font color="yellow">Since he is getting people's attention,
he might be enjoying that.</font>

392
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,851
<font color="yellow">Social media can give people
god complexes.</font>

393
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,054
<font color="yellow">Someone you don't know asks for answers.</font>

394
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:44,018
<font color="yellow">And the person asks for a word
of encouragement.</font>

395
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:47,294
<font color="yellow">That person think of you as if
you are his or her god.</font>

396
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:50,140
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with him.
It's my business.</font>

397
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,225
<font color="yellow">Some people listen to someone else's
story and put themselves into it.</font>

398
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:56,622
<font color="yellow">At one moment, they forget who they are.</font>

399
00:27:56,622 --> 00:28:01,505
<font color="yellow">They become Toycrane.
They become Producer Do.</font>

What did he do wrong?</i></font>

402

403
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:08,466

that flirtatious wife.</i></font>

<font color="yellow">- I know.
- You know? And you're still doing that?</font>

583
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:05,012
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to get arrested?
- How can you just let this slide?</font>

584
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:06,992
<font color="yellow">I have to find Adultery Patch.</font>

585
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:08,852
<font color="yellow">So are you trying to hack the website?</font>

586
00:45:08,852 --> 00:45:11,224
<font color="yellow">This is what I learned. I should use it.</font>

587
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:13,488
<font color="yellow">You were an internet security
programmer. Not a hacker.</font>

588
00:45:13,488 --> 00:45:16,028
<font color="yellow">If you are not going to help me
go away. Don't distract me.</font>

589
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:25,894
<font color="yellow">If you get caught, I'm going to say
you did everything by yourself.</font>

590
00:45:35,954 --> 00:45:37,898
<font color="yellow">They use the security program
that you made.</font>

591
00:45:37,898 --> 00:45:39,642
<font color="yellow">That's why I can't hack it.</font>

592
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:42,385
<font color="yellow">- It's too perfect.
- What do you mean you can't hack it?</font>

593
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:44,206
<font color="yellow">There is a reason when someone fails.</font>

594
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:46,340
<font color="yellow">What? Anyway. We can't hack this.</font>

595
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,300
<font color="yellow">They are using a secure coding system.</font>

596
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,383
<font color="yellow">Then what are you going to do?
Something like Zero Day Attack</font>

597
00:45:50,383 --> 00:45:52,807
<font color="yellow">RSA Algorithm, or DDoS?</font>

598
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:54,396
<font color="yellow">Their firewall is DPI. We can't do that.</font>

599
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:56,430
<font color="yellow">Then what are you going to do?</font>

600
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,936
<font color="yellow">Let's use the old method.</font>

601
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:01,023
<font color="yellow">Like how we used to collect IP addresses
when the person opens the email.</font>

602
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:02,874
<font color="yellow">We are not living in 1988.
Do you think that will work?</font>

603
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:06,030
<font color="yellow">So we have to lure him
to open the email.</font>

604
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,121
<font color="yellow">Okay. Then I will make the program.</font>

605
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:09,802
<font color="yellow">We don't have time. Hurry up.</font>

606
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,588
<font color="yellow">Done.</font>

607
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:34,689
<font color="yellow">What should I say to Adultery Patch?</font>

608
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:36,517
<font color="yellow">We have to lure him so that
he has no choice but to open the email.</font>

609
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:38,039
<font color="yellow">So what should I say to him?</font>

610
00:46:40,954 --> 00:46:42,499
<font color="yellow">Hold on a minute.</font>

611
00:47:00,974 --> 00:47:03,851
<font color="yellow"><i>[Honey]</i></font>

612
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:09,358
<font color="yellow"><i>[Honey]</i></font>

613
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:11,927
<font color="yellow">Thanks to other people,
we got some time.</font>

614
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:15,117
<font color="yellow">I will somehow stop him.</font>

615
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:19,874
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Nothing will happen. Don't worry.</font>

616
00:47:19,874 --> 00:47:21,840
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

617
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,034
<font color="yellow"><i>Go to this address.
This is Adultery Patch's address.</i></font>

618
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,624
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm here to check a gas leak.</i></font>

619
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,365
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you there?</i></font>

620
00:49:07,064 --> 00:49:09,575
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy.</font>

621
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:12,164
<font color="yellow">- Was it you?
- What are you talking about?</font>

622
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:17,889
<font color="yellow">I'm Toycrane.</font>

623
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:19,450
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

624
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:28,048
<font color="yellow">Why in the world did you do that?</font>

625
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,860
<font color="yellow">Let me hear it.</font>

626
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:39,313
<font color="yellow">I thought it was unfair.</font>

627
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:43,642
<font color="yellow">I thought it was unfair because
I was the only one suffering.</font>

628
00:49:43,642 --> 00:49:47,767
<font color="yellow">When I saw someone else
suffering from the same thing...</font>

629
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:49,666
<font color="yellow">I lost my mind.</font>

630
00:49:51,854 --> 00:49:54,827
<font color="yellow">To raise my kid well</font>

631
00:49:54,827 --> 00:49:59,005
<font color="yellow">I sent my kid and my wife abroad.</font>

632
00:49:59,005 --> 00:50:04,450
<font color="yellow">I was living in a room that looks like
a coffin. I sent all the money I had.</font>

633
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,651
<font color="yellow">What's left for me in the end was...</font>

634
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:11,293
<font color="yellow">A wife who didn't want to
come back to Korea.</font>

635
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:14,148
<font color="yellow">And my kid who was more indifferent
to me than a stranger.</font>

636
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:20,450
<font color="yellow">Last time my kid was here</font>

637
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,691
<font color="yellow">I was saying goodbye at the airport.</font>

638
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:27,910
<font color="yellow">I was the only one crying.</font>

639
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,921
<font color="yellow">I was the only one...</font>

640
00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:35,189
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

641
00:50:38,387 --> 00:50:40,081
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

642
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:49,512
<font color="yellow"><i>I was lying about revealing the personal
information about Toycrane's wife.</i></font>

643
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:52,639
<font color="yellow"><i>I just wanted to get your attention.</i></font>

644
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,195
<font color="yellow"><i>I didn't think that
it could complicate things.</i></font>

645
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:57,416
<font color="yellow"><i>I apologize for causing trouble.</i></font>

646
00:50:57,416 --> 00:51:01,349
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm very sorry to the people</i></font>

647
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,238
<font color="yellow"><i>who got hurt by this.</i></font>

648
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:08,131
<font color="yellow">It's a huge relief, right?</font>

649
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,874
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

650
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:18,548
<font color="yellow">Honey, you are here.</font>

651
00:51:18,548 --> 00:51:20,972
<font color="yellow">Oh, you went to your
parents place, right?</font>

652
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:24,818
<font color="yellow">Honey, about that flower
arrangement instructor...</font>

653
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:27,374
<font color="yellow">It was just a coincidence.
Like a car accident...</font>

654
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:30,148
<font color="yellow">It was not a head on collision.</font>

655
00:51:30,148 --> 00:51:31,992
<font color="yellow">I was not moving.</font>

656
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:34,972
<font color="yellow">It was a rear-end collision.</font>

657
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:37,677
<font color="yellow">And that happened only once.</font>

658
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:40,742
<font color="yellow">Once? That's a lie. Twice.
Twice is true.</font>

659
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:43,291
<font color="yellow">This is true. And you know how
that flower arrangement instructor</font>

660
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:46,108
<font color="yellow">always smiles when she sees a man.</font>

661
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:49,689
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything, but
she clung onto me. This is true.</font>

662
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:53,622
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'm so sorry.
Can you forgive me?</font>

663
00:51:53,622 --> 00:51:55,329
<font color="yellow">Let's get divorced.</font>

664
00:51:57,635 --> 00:52:01,885
<font color="yellow">Honey, I said I'm sorry.</font>

665
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,858
<font color="yellow">Let's get divorced.</font>

666
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:06,910
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

667
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,371
<font color="yellow">I think you are too upset now.</font>

668
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:12,577
<font color="yellow">Let's talk when you calm down at bit.</font>

669
00:52:12,577 --> 00:52:14,381
<font color="yellow">I'm not upset.</font>

670
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,994
<font color="yellow">I think it has been a year since
I stopped getting upset looking at you.</font>

671
00:52:17,994 --> 00:52:21,153
<font color="yellow">So listen to what I say.
Let's get divorced.</font>

672
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:22,945
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

673
00:52:22,945 --> 00:52:25,084
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about
that building in Seochodong.</font>

674
00:52:25,084 --> 00:52:27,546
<font color="yellow">It's under your name anyway.</font>

675
00:52:27,546 --> 00:52:30,113
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing this because of that.</font>

676
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,604
<font color="yellow">- I'm not that type of person.
- I will send the papers tomorrow.</font>

677
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:48,371
<font color="yellow">That's right. Even if we get divorced,
the building is still mine.</font>

678
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:50,463
<font color="yellow">This is not a bad deal.</font>

679
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:56,934
<font color="yellow">Manager Kim.</font>

680
00:52:56,934 --> 00:52:58,722
<font color="yellow">You may begin.</font>

681
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:14,101
<font color="yellow">You told me to not worry.
You will do everything to stop him?</font>

682
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:16,148
<font color="yellow">I did everything I could do.</font>

683
00:53:16,148 --> 00:53:18,032
<font color="yellow">I went to see a specialist in that field.</font>

684
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:20,215
<font color="yellow">- Specialist? Who?
- There is a specialist.</font>

685
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:23,668
<font color="yellow">So who is it?</font>

686
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:26,410
<font color="yellow">The owner of the internet cafe
that I go to.</font>

687
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,006
<font color="yellow">But it wasn't that internet cafe owner
knows all about the computer.</font>

688
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:33,445
<font color="yellow">That's how Producer Ann does things.</font>

689
00:53:33,445 --> 00:53:35,247
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

690
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:38,079
<font color="yellow">- Do you want go grab something to eat?
- I just want to go home.</font>

691
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,867
<font color="yellow">Let's eat together. I'm hungry and
I don't want to eat alone.</font>

692
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:45,586
<font color="yellow">This is why you don't have friends.</font>

693
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,532
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will eat with you.</font>

694
00:53:55,418 --> 00:53:57,753
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? Let's go in.
- Huh?</font>

695
00:53:57,753 --> 00:54:00,079
<font color="yellow">Let's go to a different restaurant.</font>

696
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,168
<font color="yellow">Why? You said you want to
eat spicy chicken stew.</font>

697
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:06,055
<font color="yellow">Your wife.</font>

698
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:14,610
<font color="yellow">Let's go in. It's okay.</font>

699
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,628
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and order. Let's go.</font>

700
00:54:46,653 --> 00:54:50,820
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to know
what I said to my wife?</font>

701
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,017
<font color="yellow">I finished things with her.</font>

702
00:54:54,017 --> 00:54:56,034
<font color="yellow">Just eat some chicken.</font>

703
00:54:56,034 --> 00:54:58,300
<font color="yellow">No feelings left for her.</font>

704
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,300
<font color="yellow">I said just eat some chicken.</font>

705
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,930
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

706
00:55:05,655 --> 00:55:08,124
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's hot.</font>

707
00:55:08,124 --> 00:55:10,704
<font color="yellow">It's not fully cooked yet.</font>

708
00:55:10,704 --> 00:55:13,385
<font color="yellow">Really? It's not cooked yet.</font>

709
00:55:13,385 --> 00:55:17,713
<font color="yellow">- Try it again a little later.
- Gosh, you.</font>

710
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:56,677
<font color="yellow"><i>[I was lying about revealing information
about Toycrane's wife.]</i></font>

711
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,066
<font color="yellow">Huh? What is up with that face?</font>

712
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:09,113
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous of Toycrane</font>

713
00:56:09,113 --> 00:56:12,822
<font color="yellow">working things out with his wife?</font>

714
00:56:12,822 --> 00:56:15,171
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

715
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,793
<font color="yellow">What do you mean that's not it?</font>

716
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,731
<font color="yellow">Since you brought it up,
let me ask you something.</font>

717
00:56:18,731 --> 00:56:21,599
<font color="yellow">Why did you keep telling him
to get divorced?</font>

718
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,985
<font color="yellow">You seduced my husband and
had my bedroom all to yourself.</font>

719
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:27,593
<font color="yellow">You need to have a conscience.</font>

720
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:31,287
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have done that
if you had conscience.</font>

721
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,622
<font color="yellow">Be nice.</font>

722

someone else fails.</font>

723

<font color="yellow">You won't fail because
someone else got better.</font>

724
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,992
<font color="yellow">That's really not it.</font>

725
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:44,664
<font color="yellow">If it's not that, tell me.</font>

726
00:56:44,664 --> 00:56:46,858
<font color="yellow">Why did you keep telling him

727

me and your flirtatious husband.</font>

<font color="yellow">If you divorced him...</font>

730
00:57:06,347 --> 00:57:10,785
<font color="yellow">At least you would have felt better.</font>

731
00:57:10,785 --> 00:57:13,762
<font color="yellow">That's how things work.</font>

732
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:18,918
<font color="yellow">It's not like you can forget it
when you say you are going to forget it.</font>

733
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:21,675
<font color="yellow">Just like how the wind blows in when
you open the door.</font>

734
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:24,280
<font color="yellow">It will come back to his mind
once in a while.</font>

735
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,599
<font color="yellow">It might seem difficult now.</font>

736
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:30,659
<font color="yellow">But it will help him smile later.</font>

737
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:33,530
<font color="yellow">I thought</font>

738
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,432
<font color="yellow">getting divorced is better.</font>

739
00:57:36,432 --> 00:57:39,128
<font color="yellow">It's like the cat is being
considerate of the rat.</font>

740
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:16,659
<font color="yellow">- I will get going.
- Bye.</font>

741
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,682
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, drink this one.</font>

742
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:22,381
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

743
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:26,775
<font color="yellow">Drink it.</font>

744
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:34,155
<font color="yellow">What? Writer Kwon likes espresso.</font>

745
00:58:34,155 --> 00:58:35,805
<font color="yellow">What's up with you guys today?</font>

746
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:37,896
<font color="yellow">You guys used to fight every day.</font>

747
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:42,903
<font color="yellow">Let's have a team dinner
after meeting today.</font>

748
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:44,615
<font color="yellow">I will pay for it.</font>

749
00:58:44,615 --> 00:58:47,505
<font color="yellow">- Is today a special day?
- He always pays for it.</font>

750
00:58:47,505 --> 00:58:49,113
<font color="yellow">It's not that surprising.</font>

751
00:58:49,113 --> 00:58:51,394
<font color="yellow">Guys.</font>

752
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,805
<font color="yellow">- I got divorced.
- Huh?</font>

753
00:58:56,925 --> 00:58:59,418
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't buy a meal
for that. Don't you think so?</font>

754
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:01,148
<font color="yellow">Why did you get divorced...</font>

755
00:59:01,148 --> 00:59:02,936
<font color="yellow">Is it impolite to ask these things?</font>

756
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:06,110
<font color="yellow">No, you are fine. To be honest
it has been a while since I got divorced.</font>

757
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,416
<font color="yellow">I got divorced because of a lame reason.</font>

758
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,552
<font color="yellow">We broke up because of
the personality difference.</font>

759
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,258
<font color="yellow">So from now on</font>

760
00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:21,146
<font color="yellow">think of me as</font>

761
00:59:21,146 --> 00:59:24,626
<font color="yellow">a single man.
"Brother" Ann Joon Young, okay?</font>

762
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:27,912
<font color="yellow">Bo Young, is it because of me?</font>

763
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:29,628
<font color="yellow">Let's start the meeting.</font>

764
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:35,262
<font color="yellow">I said let's start the meeting
Mr. Single Ann Joon Young.</font>

765
00:59:35,262 --> 00:59:36,822
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

766
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,441
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

767
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:01,956
<font color="yellow">Let's throw Mom's birthday party.</font>

768
01:00:01,956 --> 01:00:03,479
<font color="yellow">Mom's birthday was yesterday.</font>

769
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:07,271
<font color="yellow">Mom forget to make a wish yesterday.</font>

770
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:10,385
<font color="yellow">- So we have to do it again,
- Really?</font>

771
01:00:13,224 --> 01:00:15,938
<font color="yellow">You have to do it again if you forget
to make a wish, right?</font>

772
01:00:15,938 --> 01:00:18,907
<font color="yellow">We have to throw
the birthday party again, right?</font>

773
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:22,651
<font color="yellow"><i>Dear Mom.</i></font>

774
01:00:22,651 --> 01:00:25,506
<font color="yellow"><i>Happy birthday to you.</i></font>

775
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:46,061
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything today.</font>

776
01:00:46,061 --> 01:00:49,291
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

777
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:51,439
<font color="yellow">Then I will get going.</font>

778
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,506
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

779
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,711
<font color="yellow">You are really a bad woman.</font>

780
01:01:05,253 --> 01:01:07,916
<font color="yellow">Jung Soo Yeon,
you are really a bad woman.</font>

781
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:11,064
<font color="yellow">You know that, right?</font>

782
01:01:11,064 --> 01:01:13,189
<font color="yellow">You are selfish. You're the worst.</font>

783
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,410
<font color="yellow">But.</font>

784
01:01:22,017 --> 01:01:24,084
<font color="yellow">I'm way worse than you.</font>

785
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:31,343
<font color="yellow">After we got married...</font>

786
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:33,840
<font color="yellow">No, even after we had Joon Soo</font>

787
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,595
<font color="yellow">I never tried to</font>

788
01:01:36,595 --> 01:01:40,097
<font color="yellow">fully understand you.</font>

789
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:45,204
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for just passing by you</font>

790
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:49,800
<font color="yellow">whenever you are aimlessly looking
out the window.</font>

791
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,345
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for leaving you alone</font>

792
01:01:53,345 --> 01:01:59,351
<font color="yellow">during the time you had to get rid of
your high heels to wear loafers.</font>

793
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:05,512
<font color="yellow">The past eight years,
we've never had a fight.</font>

794
01:02:05,512 --> 01:02:08,793
<font color="yellow">I thought we were doing well.</font>

795
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:11,231
<font color="yellow">I boasted about that too.</font>

796
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:15,977
<font color="yellow">There were a lot of things I didn't know.</font>

797
01:02:19,597 --> 01:02:23,077
<font color="yellow">There were too many things I didn't know.</font>

798
01:02:23,077 --> 01:02:26,260
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

799
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,267
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who should apologize.</font>

800
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:32,959
<font color="yellow">I left a big scar on Joon Soo and you.</font>

801
01:02:38,093 --> 01:02:41,557
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry for making you
be like that.</font>
