<font color="yellow">How about working on our detective agency concept?</font>

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,160
<font color="yellow">- Detective agency? - So our plan should be--</font>

78
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,160
<font color="yellow">What do I lack?</font>

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,320
<font color="yellow">What's the reason?</font>

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
<font color="yellow">After they abolished the adultery law</font>

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,680
<font color="yellow">I heard detective agencies are actually getting more work.</font>

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,240
<font color="yellow">So I think we should make it more realistic.</font>

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,680
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't people say we are just try to make fun out of it?</font>

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,160
<font color="yellow">- We should think about that a bit more. - We are done. Think about what?</font>

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,600
<font color="yellow">I like that concept.</font>

86
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,400
<font color="yellow">Since we will only be filming outside, we won't need an MC or a studio.</font>

87
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,520
<font color="yellow">Based on my data, I think we can handle that with our current budget.</font>

88
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,440
<font color="yellow">Okay. Great.</font>

89
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,080
<font color="yellow">With a detective agency concept in mind, we are chasing after a forbidden love.</font>

90
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,920
<font color="yellow">- Oh, great. - What?</font>

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,520
<font color="yellow">Forbidden love?</font>

92
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,440
<font color="yellow">What is "forbidden love?"</font>

93
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,280
<font color="yellow">You call having an affair a love?</font>

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,680
<font color="yellow">Hurting other people, is that love?</font>

95
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,480
<font color="yellow">Then what should we do about our ending?</font>

96
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,120
<font color="yellow">What if we find out that they are actually having an affair?</font>

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,480
<font color="yellow">We should first listen to what his wife says--</font>

98
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
<font color="yellow">What do you mean listen to her?</font>

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,240
<font color="yellow">Do you think she would say I'm the bad person?</font>

100
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,440
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to listen to her excuses?</font>

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,920
<font color="yellow">We are getting divorced no matter what.</font>

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,840
<font color="yellow">She will only make excuses.</font>

103
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,040
<font color="yellow">But we can't make all our clients get divorced.</font>

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,560
<font color="yellow">To solve the problem, we have to find out why his wife had an affair.</font>

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,280
<font color="yellow">If you have a reason, can you stab someone with knife?</font>

106
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,840
<font color="yellow">- What? - What is wrong with you?</font>

107
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,480
<font color="yellow">Are you going through menopause?</font>

108
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
<font color="yellow">Having an affair is the same.</font>

109
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,760
<font color="yellow">Those people who think cheating is a love and a romance</font>

110
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,400
<font color="yellow">screw them.</font>

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,080
<font color="yellow">Having an affair is a crime. Whoever does it, it's a crime!</font>

112

<font color="yellow">If this is her first time, you can stop her ahead of time.</font>

145

148
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,040
<font color="yellow">based on how serious their relationship is, your response should change.</font>

149
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,320

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,000
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should look more into their relationship first?</font>

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,920
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

155
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,040
<font color="yellow">Our scenario is we are going to follow our client's wife.</font>

156
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,520
<font color="yellow">Secretively.</font>

157
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,880
<font color="yellow">The wife who said she is going to exercise</font>

158
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,440
<font color="yellow">gets in a suspicious SUV that was parked in the park.</font>

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,000
<font color="yellow">In the car, they have light skinship</font>

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
<font color="yellow">and the car leaves.</font>

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,160
<font color="yellow">They drive a long way.</font>

162
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,680
<font color="yellow">And they stop at a quiet motel in the countryside.</font>

163
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,640
<font color="yellow">They tenderly get out of the car, get in an elevator, and go into a room.</font>

164
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,520
<font color="yellow">When are we going into the room?</font>

165
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,560
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to go into the room? The car stopped at a motel.</font>

166
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
<font color="yellow">The wife got out of the car with a stranger.</font>

167
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,440
<font color="yellow">They walk into a motel, and we film that exact moment.</font>

168
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,400
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

169
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,160
<font color="yellow">What is up with this response?</font>

170
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,600
<font color="yellow">- They didn't go into the room yet. - They are going to get in.</font>

171
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,440
<font color="yellow">Since they are going to get a room they went to the motel.</font>

172
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,160
<font color="yellow">Even if they are in a room, they have to "do that" to say...</font>

173
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,200
<font color="yellow">They didn't go to the motel to eat.</font>

174
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
<font color="yellow">Isn't it obvious?</font>

175
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,280
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Then what's men's standard on cheating?</font>

176
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,000
<font color="yellow">Even if they went to motel to sleep together, they haven't yet.</font>

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,120
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

178
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
<font color="yellow">The person is "out" for just going to the motel.</font>

179
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,560
<font color="yellow">As a husband, the fact that my wife went to a motel with a stranger can</font>

180
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,600
<font color="yellow">be upsetting. But. Things can change if she didn't get into the room yet.</font>

181
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,520
<font color="yellow">- Right? - Right.</font>

182
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,240
<font color="yellow">That's a possibility.</font>

183
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,040
<font color="yellow">Okay. Okay then.</font>

184
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,600
<font color="yellow">Let's film them when they get into a room.</font>

185
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,280
<font color="yellow">That's still a little...</font>

186
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh. They are in a room together. Is that still not enough?</font>

187
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,040
<font color="yellow">Even if they are in a room together, that's not enough.</font>

188
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,680
<font color="yellow">We have to know for sure that they slept together.</font>

189
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,200
<font color="yellow">That's how all men are.</font>

190
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,520
<font color="yellow">After seeing his girlfriend holding someone else's hand</font>

191
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,160
<font color="yellow">he asks her if she slept with her.</font>

192
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,840
<font color="yellow">Then let's say they are 10 seconds away from sleeping together.</font>

193
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
<font color="yellow">They don't have anything on. Is it still no?</font>

194
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,320
<font color="yellow">- No, that's not enough. - Everything will be over in 10 seconds.</font>

195
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,920
<font color="yellow">- They haven't slept yet. - So you mean what's important is</font>

196
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,760
<font color="yellow">whether your wife has helped him make offspring?</font>

197
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,400
<font color="yellow">I just can't understand man.</font>

198
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,480
<font color="yellow">That's what you guys want to believe.</font>

199
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,720
<font color="yellow">I want to believe that. And I believe that.</font>

200
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,440
<font color="yellow">Then.</font>

201
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,400
<font color="yellow">They have luxurious clothes here.</font>

202
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,760
<font color="yellow">I think it will look good on you.</font>

203
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,120
<font color="yellow">Look at this one. What do you think? Doesn't this look nice?</font>

204
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,880
<font color="yellow">- Huh? - I think this is too much.</font>

205
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,400
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

206
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,080
<font color="yellow">Well. How about this one?</font>

207
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,280
<font color="yellow">This is a bit loud.</font>

208
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,400
<font color="yellow">No way. You will look elegant.</font>

209
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,120
<font color="yellow">Look. This looks nice on people who have face shapes like ours.</font>

210
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,600
<font color="yellow">Wow, this looks very elegant.</font>

211
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,320
<font color="yellow">I think you will look very elegant in this.</font>

212
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,160
<font color="yellow">It's okay if it's a bit loud. You are sexy.</font>

213
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you.</font>

214
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,880
<font color="yellow">- We will go eat lunch. - Are you not going with us?</font>

215
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,600
<font color="yellow">I don't feel well. You guys go ahead.</font>

216
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,640
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

217
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,600
<font color="yellow">[One hour ago.]</font>

218
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
<font color="yellow">What should he do? Gosh.</font>

219
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,600
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

220
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,080
<font color="yellow">What should I do if I want to leave a comment like them?</font>

221
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,160
<font color="yellow">You can make a ID and leave a comment.</font>

222
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,920
<font color="yellow">ID... What is that?</font>

223
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,560
<font color="yellow">Myun Mok Dong Yok.</font>

224
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,200
<font color="yellow">Being nice can also be a problem.</font>

225
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,160
<font color="yellow">Being nice...</font>

226
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,800
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

227
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,400
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

228
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,320
<font color="yellow">Didn't I say finish it up and come eat?</font>

229
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

230
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,640
<font color="yellow">What do you mean that's not it?</font>

231
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,440
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

232
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,680
<font color="yellow">First, be calm and find out who she is having an affair with.</font>

233
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,920
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should look more into their relationship?</font>

234
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,400
<font color="yellow">It's an affair because they are hiding from me.</font>

235
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,160
<font color="yellow">How can I find out who that bastard is?</font>

236
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,560
<font color="yellow">How was your blind date?</font>

237
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,720
<font color="yellow">- I didn't go. - Why?</font>

238
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,440
<font color="yellow">I searched for his social media. He's not my type.</font>

239
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,520
<font color="yellow">He was sitting down in all of his pictures.</font>

240
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,480
<font color="yellow">That means he is short.</font>

241
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,280
<font color="yellow">I can forgive everything, but I can't stand short guys.</font>

242
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,160
<font color="yellow">There's nothing much.</font>

243
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
<font color="yellow">Jung Soo Yeon. Jung Soo Yeon.</font>

244
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,800
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

245
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,080
<font color="yellow">Micheal.</font>

246
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,520
<font color="yellow">He's not here.</font>

247
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,240
<font color="yellow">Why are their so many Micheals?</font>

248
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,280
<font color="yellow">Micheal, Micheal.</font>

249
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,360
<font color="yellow">- Steak, date with husband, love you. - Why do women take these pictures?</font>

250
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,440
<font color="yellow">Are you going to show it off to your friends?</font>

251
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,360
<font color="yellow">It's fun. And it makes my heart flutter</font>

252
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,920
<font color="yellow">when I post pictures of us on our dates.</font>

253
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,840
<font color="yellow">It's fun for me too.</font>

254
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,720
<font color="yellow">But, more than taking pictures...</font>

255
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,720
<font color="yellow">Doesn't this make your heart flutter more?</font>

256
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,440
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

257
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting with a client. You can go first.</font>

258
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,120
<font color="yellow">Oh, good luck.</font>

259
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,440
<font color="yellow">- What about dinner? - Of course, I have to eat at home.</font>

260
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,680
<font color="yellow">You know that white blouse? Let me buy that.</font>

261
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,320
<font color="yellow">It's this one, right?</font>

262
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
<font color="yellow">It's my gift.</font>

263
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
<font color="yellow">And this is a freebie.</font>

264
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,920
<font color="yellow">By the way. Your wife's shoes and bag... She has all the luxury items.</font>

265
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,240
<font color="yellow">Those are worth two years of my rent. Amazing.</font>

266
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
<font color="yellow">Is our baby having trouble paying rent?</font>

267
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,120
<font color="yellow">I will have to look for a lease.</font>

268
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,880
<font color="yellow">Really? Really?</font>

269
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,680
<font color="yellow">Are you on your break?</font>

270
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,760
<font color="yellow">- Let's go eat something delicious. - Didn't you eat lunch with your wife?</font>

271
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,680
<font color="yellow">It was just an appetizer. Now, I will be having the main dish.</font>

272
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,640
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the countryside.</font>

273
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,720
<font color="yellow">Okay, sir. I will find a size four and get it ready for you.</font>

274
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please get it ready.</font>

275
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,600
<font color="yellow">Red looks good on you.</font>

276
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,680
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

277
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,240
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

278
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,840
<font color="yellow">Use this to pay for everything.</font>

279
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,320
<font color="yellow">Did you win the lotto or something? Why do you pay for everyone?</font>

280
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
<font color="yellow">I'm paying because I'm capable.</font>

281
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
<font color="yellow">- Doesn't your wife get upset at you? - No.</font>

282
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,840
<font color="yellow">She's very cool.</font>

283
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,600
<font color="yellow">She's not cool. She is just abandoning you.</font>

284
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,000
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, please pay for everything except hers.</font>

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
<font color="yellow">That's okay. I'm cool.</font>

286
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,200
<font color="yellow">Please give me the receipt.</font>

287
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,440
<font color="yellow">You buy meals and drinks every day. You have a family.</font>

288
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,560
<font color="yellow">Do you think you are an angel?</font>

289
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,800
<font color="yellow">We don't care about our personal expenses.</font>

290
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,640
<font color="yellow">We care only about what we share.</font>

291
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
<font color="yellow">By the way. Aren't we a bit awkward?</font>

292
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,160
<font color="yellow">Wasn't that why you didn't accept my friend request?</font>

293
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,920
<font color="yellow">We weren't close enough to ask about each others husband or wife?</font>

294
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,520
<font color="yellow">I should send a friend request to PD Ahn's wife.</font>

295
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,320
<font color="yellow">- You won't be able to find her. - Why? She will be on social media.</font>

296
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,040
<font color="yellow">You must be her friend. I'm going to search for her.</font>

297
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,240
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, why are you searching for her?</font>

298
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,480
<font color="yellow">A husband and a wife are not friends.</font>

299
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,160
<font color="yellow">Why are they not friends?</font>

300
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,560
<font color="yellow">Why do they have to be friends on social media?</font>

301
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,640
<font color="yellow">- I see her every day at home. - Hold on. What about me?</font>

302
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,600
<font color="yellow">You see me every day at work, but you nagged me to accept your friend request.</font>

303
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,840
<font color="yellow">How are those the same?</font>

304
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,320
<font color="yellow">How are they different?</font>

305
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,040
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

306
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,120
<font color="yellow">Isn't that PD Do's wife?</font>

307
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,440
<font color="yellow">- Where? - There.</font>

308
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,280
<font color="yellow">Oh, you are right. It's Soo Yeon.</font>

309
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,320
<font color="yellow">Right. Didn't he say his wife's company is close to here?</font>

310
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

311
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung...</font>

312
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, what is that? They are looking good. Hold on.</font>

313
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,480
<font color="yellow">He smells nice.</font>

314
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,160
<font color="yellow">What? Smell...</font>

315
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,680
<font color="yellow">I should take a picture. I'm doing my job right today.</font>

316
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,360
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Don't do that.</font>

317
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,240
<font color="yellow">Micheal. Micheal.</font>

318
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,720
<font color="yellow">Who is this bastard?</font>

319
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,600
<font color="yellow">Is he a foreigner, or a Korean-American?</font>

320
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

321
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,840
<font color="yellow">Your wife is having an affair.</font>

322
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,600
<font color="yellow">Yoon Ki. Yoon Ki.</font>

323
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,360
<font color="yellow">Hey, hold on, hold on.</font>

324
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,640
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Hold on.</font>

325
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,000
<font color="yellow">- What is that, Yoon Ki? - They sometimes have hidden cameras.</font>

326
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,280
<font color="yellow">They have hidden cameras? Are they filming me?</font>

327
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,040
<font color="yellow">I don't think they have it here.</font>

328
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,320
<font color="yellow">- They don't have it here? - No.</font>

329
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,440
<font color="yellow">What could you have done without me?</font>

330
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,840
<font color="yellow">- I would have been in big trouble. - Right?</font>

331
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, Hyun Woo.</font>

332
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,560
<font color="yellow">I saw Soo Yeon for the first time in a while, and she was still pretty.</font>

333
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
<font color="yellow">Okay, I know she is your wife.</font>

334
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,760
<font color="yellow">The man she was with. He was very handsome.</font>

335
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,040
<font color="yellow">- That's enough. Let's start the meeting. - Was he that good?</font>

336
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,760
<font color="yellow">I want to see him too.</font>

337
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,240
<font color="yellow">Guys can tell from 100 meters away how a man matches up.</font>

338
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,480
<font color="yellow">Think about those animal documentaries. Hyenas never fight lions</font>

339
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,200
<font color="yellow">and always crouch when a lion is around.</font>

340
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,520
<font color="yellow">That's an instinct for survival.</font>

341
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,880
<font color="yellow">Oh. Didn't Writer Kwon say he smelled nice?</font>

342
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah... he did smell nice.</font>

343
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,880
<font color="yellow">- See? - I saw this on a blog before</font>

344
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,600
<font color="yellow">that if a man has a nice scent, that means he's in love.</font>

345
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,560
<font color="yellow">Is Soo Yeon having an affair?</font>

346
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,400
<font color="yellow">Gosh. He's not funny, and he does not have any creativity.</font>

347
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,280
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

348
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,000
<font color="yellow">He's upset again.</font>

349
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,520
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, I was just kidding. Gosh.</font>

350
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,120
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Are you going out to buy cologne?</font>

351
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you so... upset?</font>

352
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,320
<font color="yellow">Get back to work.</font>

353
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,160
<font color="yellow">What? An affair?</font>

354
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,520
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon?</font>

355
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,840
<font color="yellow">- Not you, but Soo Yeon? - Yes!</font>

356
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,560
<font color="yellow">Why did you fuss about it?</font>

357
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,880
<font color="yellow">Wait. Let's get things straight here.</font>

358
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,760
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon is going to a hotel. This Saturday.</font>

359
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,400
<font color="yellow">So it's in two days.</font>

360
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,720
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon is going to a hotel with a bastard?</font>

361
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,480
<font color="yellow">So. What you said during yesterday's meeting was your story.</font>

362
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,480
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

363
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,080
<font color="yellow">It's in two days. Are you going to let her go to that hotel?</font>

364
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,520
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

365
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,280
<font color="yellow">But I have no idea what I should do.</font>

366
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,880
<font color="yellow">Let's just break in.</font>

367
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,560
<font color="yellow">Let's catch them at the scene, beat that guy up, and make a mess.</font>

368
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,400
<font color="yellow">And let's throw divorce papers at Soo Yeon.</font>

369
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,240
<font color="yellow">Divorce papers?</font>

370
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, hold on.</font>

371
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,040
<font color="yellow">Let's calm down and think about this.</font>

372
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,880
<font color="yellow">We can't be sure if she is actually having an affair yet.</font>

373
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,520
<font color="yellow">What do you mean yet?</font>

374
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
<font color="yellow">Yet? Do you think that makes sense?</font>

375
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,560
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

376
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,760
<font color="yellow">The moment she let him book a room, she is "out."</font>

377
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,800
<font color="yellow">There's a difference between a man's and a woman's affair.</font>

378
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,120
<font color="yellow">A man's affair is like having measles.</font>

379
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,880
<font color="yellow">But in a woman's affair, feelings are involved.</font>

380
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,520
<font color="yellow">Psychologically, it's way more serious.</font>

381
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,480
<font color="yellow">But she's not having an affair yet.</font>

382
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,520
<font color="yellow">You guys said no. You guys said that during meeting today.</font>

383
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,200
<font color="yellow">Okay then. Just let it slide. Don't ask her about the details.</font>

384
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
<font color="yellow">Cheating is not a big deal these days. You are being positive. This is good.</font>

385
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,760
<font color="yellow">You bastard. How could you say that?</font>

386
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,120
<font color="yellow">Then go ask Soo Yeon.</font>

387
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,880
<font color="yellow">You should have talked to her when you first saw that text.</font>

388
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,160
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because I feel bad too.</font>

389
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,080
<font color="yellow">If you can't ask her, go ask a detective agency for help.</font>

390
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
<font color="yellow">Get Soo Yeon's caller history.</font>

391
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,760
<font color="yellow">And find out how she responded to that bastard's text message.</font>

392
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,000
<font color="yellow">If she said no to him, we don't even have to worry about this.</font>

393
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,560
<font color="yellow">So look into this.</font>

394
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
<font color="yellow">- Honey, I'm sorry I'm late. - You are here.</font>

395
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,320
<font color="yellow">- The traffic is so bad right now. - I will get your meal ready.</font>

396
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

397
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,280
<font color="yellow">- I will go wash my hands. - Okay.</font>

398
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,880
<font color="yellow">Something smells very nice.</font>

399
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,800
<font color="yellow">Go ask a detective agency for help.</font>

400
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,560
<font color="yellow">Get Soo Yeon's caller history.</font>

401
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,160
<font color="yellow">And find out how she responded to that bastard's text message.</font>

402
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,840
<font color="yellow">I have a question.</font>

403
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,080
<font color="yellow">- By any chance, do you-- - Is your wife having an affair?</font>

404
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,640
<font color="yellow">No. Yes.</font>

405
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,040
<font color="yellow">Then go wait inside. It smells over there.</font>

406
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,640
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

407
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,880
<font color="yellow">I don't feel well.</font>

408
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,600
<font color="yellow">Go wait inside. I will be there soon.</font>

409
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,280
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Okay.</font>

410
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,480
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat. - Okay.</font>

411
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,080
<font color="yellow">I'm very busy these days, and I didn't get a chance to go to bathroom.</font>

412
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,600
<font color="yellow">I have constipation.</font>

413
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,200
<font color="yellow">- Drink it. - Okay.</font>

414
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,880
<font color="yellow">There's nothing special here, right?</font>

415
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,680
<font color="yellow">It surprises everyone. In movies, detective agencies seems very scary.</font>

416
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,280
<font color="yellow">This is our business venue. Just like everyone else.</font>

417
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,160
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's true.</font>

418
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,600
<font color="yellow">- When did it start? - Huh?</font>

419
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,880
<font color="yellow">When did you start questioning her?</font>

420
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. On Monday.</font>

421
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,920
<font color="yellow">A guy sent my wife a text and asked her if they could meet at a hotel.</font>

422
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,200
<font color="yellow">- Oh. - How did she respond to that and...</font>

423
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,480
<font color="yellow">- if she called him... - Hm.</font>

424
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,640
<font color="yellow">How long have you been married?</font>

425
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,160
<font color="yellow">- Eight years. - Eight years.</font>

426
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,440
<font color="yellow">There's a high possibility.</font>

427
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,360
<font color="yellow">People start having affairs a lot during those years.</font>

428
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,040
<font color="yellow">I have something to show you.</font>

429
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,120
<font color="yellow">This picture was taken today.</font>

430
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,760
<font color="yellow">Hm. I don't need it. It's not that helpful.</font>

431
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,680
<font color="yellow">We will find out right away once we start working on it.</font>

432
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,520
<font color="yellow">Wow, your wife is very pretty.</font>

433
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
<font color="yellow">Right? Thank you...</font>

434
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Not everyone comes here to end their relationship.</font>

435
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,480
<font color="yellow">Okay then. There are three main tactics that we use often.</font>

436
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,280
<font color="yellow">Tailing, phone tapping, and a call history check.</font>

437
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,920
<font color="yellow">The one we use the most is call history check.</font>

438
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,240
<font color="yellow">It is because it is hard to get caught, and we don't waste money.</font>

439
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,840
<font color="yellow">Then, sign this agreement form.</font>

440
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,880
<font color="yellow">Put your wife's phone number, carrier</font>

441
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
<font color="yellow">and first few digits of her social security number.</font>

442
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,280
<font color="yellow">- What? - You want to know</font>

443
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,400
<font color="yellow">how serious their relationship is, right?</font>

444
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,520
<font color="yellow">- That's right. - Yes.</font>

445
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,800
<font color="yellow">Once we get paid, we will start working on it right away.</font>

446
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,800
<font color="yellow">We can tell how serious they are by just looking at two texts...</font>

447
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,760
<font color="yellow">No, we can tell just by looking at two emoticons.</font>

448
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,720
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

449
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,920
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

450
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,320
<font color="yellow">Eat this while you are working.</font>

451
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,480
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring so much?</font>

452
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,920
<font color="yellow">You need all these things.</font>

453
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,880
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

454
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,320
<font color="yellow">It's a black currant. It's a good antioxidant.</font>

455
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,360
<font color="yellow">It also helps your eyes to relax.</font>

456
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,360
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to check it?</font>

457
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,440
<font color="yellow">- What? - Your message. It's something urgent.</font>

458
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,400
<font color="yellow">I was too focused on working. I didn't hear it.</font>

459
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,080
<font color="yellow">I should check my message.</font>

460
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,240
<font color="yellow">Who is it at this late hour? Is it Attorney Kim?</font>

461
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,040
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

462
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,800
<font color="yellow">It's Hyun Woo. Do Hyun Woo.</font>

463
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,840
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

464
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,240
<font color="yellow">Look. It's Hyun Woo.</font>

465
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,080
<font color="yellow">Why is he texting me at this hour?</font>

466
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,400
<font color="yellow">- Is it Hyun Woo? - Yes, look.</font>

467
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,680
<font color="yellow">"What are you doing? Let's have a drink. I'm in the neighborhood."</font>

468
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,800
<font color="yellow">Why did he send me a text? He should have called me.</font>

469
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,240
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

470
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,200
<font color="yellow">That works? Do they sell it?</font>

471
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,560
<font color="yellow">Oh, you are here.</font>

472
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,160
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I'm Attorney Choi Yoon Ki.</font>

473
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,000
<font color="yellow">I'm PD Do's best friend.</font>

474
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,360
<font color="yellow">As heard, you are very beautiful.</font>

475
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,000
<font color="yellow">You must be very happy.</font>

476
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,920
<font color="yellow">Give us some beer please.</font>

477
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,920
<font color="yellow">Beer please.</font>

478
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,520
<font color="yellow">Give us the most expensive snack here.</font>

479
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,920
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed because of you.</font>

480
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,080
<font color="yellow">I thought you were dating her.</font>

481
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,600
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

482
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,040
<font color="yellow">By the way, you have changed a lot.</font>

483
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,240
<font color="yellow">You called me out to make excuses.</font>

484
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,240
<font color="yellow">I said that's not true. I'm not you.</font>

485
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,480
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

486
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,000
<font color="yellow">Everything is high-tech now. It's scary.</font>

487
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,040
<font color="yellow">This picks up any hidden cameras, phone tapping, things like that.</font>

488
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,000
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

489
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,480
<font color="yellow">Recently, when I see my wife, something just doesn't feel right.</font>

490
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,040
<font color="yellow">It seems like she knows something.</font>

491
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,080
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, I was checking everything at my house with this.</font>

492
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,160
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

493
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,360
<font color="yellow">Oh, it got turned off.</font>

494
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I was so surprised.</font>

495
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,880
<font color="yellow">Hey, isn't phone tapping against the law?</font>

496
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,440
<font color="yellow">Take your hands off. Hands off.</font>

497
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,400
<font color="yellow">It's illegal.</font>

498
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,680
<font color="yellow">You can't even use it as evidence in court.</font>

499
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,720
<font color="yellow">But you can still check if your spouse cheated on you or not.</font>

500
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,160
<font color="yellow">I still don't think it's something a human should do.</font>

501
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,360
<font color="yellow">I think so too.</font>

502
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,120
<font color="yellow">The ones who do those things are way worse than the ones who cheat.</font>

503
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,360
<font color="yellow">So you don't want to get caught by your wife?</font>

504
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,000
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

505
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

506
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,120
<font color="yellow">Does that mean you still have feelings left for her?</font>

507
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,800
<font color="yellow">Why would I have feelings left for her?</font>

508
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,560
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you? Marriage and dating are two different things.</font>

509
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,920
<font color="yellow">My office, and that building. Those are all my father-in-law's stuff.</font>

510
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,240
<font color="yellow">He owns many of them.</font>

511
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,120
<font color="yellow">My wife?</font>

512
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,080
<font color="yellow">She's an only child, good at cooking cleaning, sewing. She's perfect.</font>

513
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,040
<font color="yellow">She is perfect as a maid who works for free.</font>

514
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,880
<font color="yellow">You bastard.</font>

515
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,680
<font color="yellow">That was a compliment.</font>

516
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,240
<font color="yellow">Isn't she pretty?</font>

517
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, what do you think?</font>

518
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,840
<font color="yellow">When a woman is having an affair</font>

519
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,320
<font color="yellow">do people always get divorced?</font>

520
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,560
<font color="yellow">A wife's affair is not a matter of</font>

521
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,560
<font color="yellow">a husband forgiving her or not.</font>

522
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,200
<font color="yellow">It depends on whether the wife is willing to go back to the family.</font>

523
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,160
<font color="yellow">That's more important.</font>

524
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,560
<font color="yellow">When people get charged for adultery</font>

525
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,720
<font color="yellow">nine out of the ten man say he didn't cheat.</font>

526
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,320
<font color="yellow">They say "that woman is a player."</font>

527
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,360
<font color="yellow">- Do you know what the woman says? - What?</font>

528
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,000
<font color="yellow">"I loved him. Arrest me."</font>

529
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,880
<font color="yellow">That's what they all say.</font>

530
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,400
<font color="yellow">When you have to give up something that's in your hand</font>

531
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,400
<font color="yellow">women become braver than men.</font>

532
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,520
<font color="yellow">[I wish someone could drink with me.]</font>

533
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,880
<font color="yellow">[If I was in the area, I could have went there.]</font>

534
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,320
<font color="yellow">[Where are you?] [I'm in Chung Dam.]</font>

535
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,720
<font color="yellow">[Oh, it's close from here.]</font>

536
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
<font color="yellow">- I have to go. - Go where?</font>

537
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,880
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask? You know where.</font>

538
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,040
<font color="yellow">You know this, right? I drank with you all night.</font>

539
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,240
<font color="yellow">I drank with you until eight, okay? I will get going.</font>

540
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,400
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he is...</font>

541
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,560
<font color="yellow">He's a strange bastard.</font>

542
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,520
<font color="yellow">When you have to give up something that's in your hand</font>

543
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,080
<font color="yellow">women become braver than men.</font>

544
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,120
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

545
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,320
<font color="yellow">When did you become so brave?</font>

546
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,320
<font color="yellow">You are here. You are late.</font>

547
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,760
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

548
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,560
<font color="yellow">What about Joon Soo?</font>

549
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,640
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo? He must have been tired. He went to bed early.</font>

550
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,280
<font color="yellow">I guess he ran a lot today.</font>

551
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,560
<font color="yellow">Oh, really.</font>

552
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,400
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

553
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,440
<font color="yellow">Laundry.</font>

554
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,240
<font color="yellow">I'm behind in laundry.</font>

555
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,920
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

556
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,880
<font color="yellow">The moms from the day care. It's Yoon Woo's birthday.</font>

557
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

558
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,360
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right.</font>

559
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,400
<font color="yellow">Joon Young said he saw you today.</font>

560
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,720
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

561
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,040
<font color="yellow">Where did he see me?</font>

562
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,600
<font color="yellow">He said it was a cafe in Gangnam.</font>

563
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,840
<font color="yellow">Then why didn't he say hello?</font>

564
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,680
<font color="yellow">You were with somebody. So he couldn't say hello.</font>

565
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,600
<font color="yellow">Oh, it was a business meeting.</font>

566
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,480
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

567
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,360
<font color="yellow">Who was it? Someone from work?</font>

568
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,440
<font color="yellow">Yes. I told you before.</font>

569
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,000
<font color="yellow">I got selected to work on a new project.</font>

570
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,680
<font color="yellow">It's vague.</font>

571
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,440
<font color="yellow">You got selected to work on a project? You are amazing.</font>

572
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,560
<font color="yellow">Who else got selected?</font>

573
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,200
<font color="yellow">From our company, two designers got selected.</font>

574
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,320
<font color="yellow">And from headquarters, people from planning and marketing got selected.</font>

575
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,000
<font color="yellow">We have several people from all departments.</font>

576
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
<font color="yellow">Even more vague.</font>

577
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,080
<font color="yellow">I have a filming schedule this Saturday.</font>

578
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,200
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say Joon Soo is doing something at his day care?</font>

579
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,440
<font color="yellow">Can you pick him up?</font>

580
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,520
<font color="yellow">Saturday?</font>

581
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,600
<font color="yellow">I have to work on Saturday.</font>

582
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,520
<font color="yellow">Never mind. It should be fine.</font>

583
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,040
<font color="yellow">It's okay? You booked a hotel room.</font>

584
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,600
<font color="yellow">The meeting starts at 1 o'clock.</font>

585
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,880
<font color="yellow">I will be done by 6 o'clock.</font>

586
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,200
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

587
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,600
<font color="yellow">From 1 o'clock to 6 o'clock?</font>

588
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,000
<font color="yellow">The meeting is so long. It must be very tiring.</font>

589
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,840
<font color="yellow">I do that all the time.</font>

590
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,360
<font color="yellow">Where is the meeting held?</font>

591
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,080
<font color="yellow">My client is going to decide and let me know.</font>

592
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,760
<font color="yellow">Wake up--</font>

593
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,360
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

594
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,560
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep because of Dad.</font>

595
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,840
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Dad is not here.</font>

596
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,400
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

597
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,440
<font color="yellow">He went out a while ago.</font>

598
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,440
<font color="yellow">I'm too tired. I don't think I can go to day care.</font>

599
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,080
<font color="yellow">[Until my wife's secret love affair, D-1.]</font>

600
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,880
<font color="yellow">[Until my wife's secret love affair, D-1.]</font>

601
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,840
<font color="yellow">[Pretty Wife]</font>

602
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,720
<font color="yellow">[Wife]</font>

603
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,600
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Hyun Woo--</font>

604
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,320
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

605
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,800
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

606
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

607
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,640
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

608
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,080
<font color="yellow">Do you think something happened? Do you want something to happen?</font>

609
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,840
<font color="yellow">No, I was just asking to be nice--</font>

610
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,880
<font color="yellow">Since when are you nice?</font>

611
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,080
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - You are here.</font>

612
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,280
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

613
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,560
<font color="yellow">- Are you sick? - What could you do if he was sick?</font>

614
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,040
<font color="yellow">Are you going to use your fancy data to introduce him to a doctor?</font>

615
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,160
<font color="yellow">- If not, keep your mouth shut. - Be quiet.</font>

616
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,240
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

617
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,520
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with him?</font>

618
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,080
<font color="yellow">He's just like a dog that barks when a stranger comes near him.</font>

619
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,360
<font color="yellow">PD Do, can we talk for a minute?</font>

620
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,520
<font color="yellow">I will go.</font>

621
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,080
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

622
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,680
<font color="yellow">I will talk with the CEO instead of Hyun Woo.</font>

623
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,160
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - I will--</font>

624
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,320
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I will go.</font>

625
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,200
<font color="yellow">I will go.</font>

626
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,320
<font color="yellow">What is going on with you these days?</font>

627
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,640
<font color="yellow">You are zoning out.</font>

628
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,040
<font color="yellow">Even a lonely father like me is doing just fine.</font>

629
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
<font color="yellow">Actually, I'm not doing just fine.</font>

630
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,000
<font color="yellow">By the way, Hyun Woo. How is the proposal going? Is it going well?</font>

631
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,640
<font color="yellow">Yes. We are doing okay.</font>

632
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,440
<font color="yellow">We are going to start filming first.</font>

633
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,120
<font color="yellow">Just bear with me.</font>

634
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,680
<font color="yellow">If this goes well, things will get easier for me.</font>

635
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,200
<font color="yellow">I will support everything you want to do.</font>

636
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,040
<font color="yellow">Whether it's a TV program or a movie...</font>

637
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,200
<font color="yellow">I will finish writing the proposal some time today.</font>

638
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,800
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - Because of PD Ahn</font>

639
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,240
<font color="yellow">- we can't start our meeting. - What did PD Ahn do?</font>

640
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

641
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,120
<font color="yellow">Let's continue.</font>

642
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,800
<font color="yellow">So the husband is going to catch his wife having an affair on the scene</font>

643
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,560
<font color="yellow">- and we are going to-- - Hold on.</font>

644
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,120
<font color="yellow">- Hold on. - We can't continue like this.</font>

645
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,440
<font color="yellow">I thought about this a lot... I don't think this is right.</font>

646
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,200
<font color="yellow">Let's forget this item.</font>

647
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,560
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? We're filming it tomorrow.</font>

648
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,680
<font color="yellow">This is not something a human can do.</font>

649
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,440
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?</font>

650
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,640
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, Hyun Woo. - Hey, come here.</font>

651
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,800
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - It hurts.</font>

652
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,200
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?</font>

653
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,000
<font color="yellow">When you were being hesitant during the last meeting</font>

654
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,080
<font color="yellow">I made fun of you and said you are an old man now.</font>

655
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,920
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for making fun of you. My heart aches.</font>

656
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,120
<font color="yellow">I'm a bad guy. I'm very sorry.</font>

657
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,160
<font color="yellow">Hey, that's okay.</font>

658
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
<font color="yellow">But we have to make our program.</font>

659
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,760
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do it.</font>

660
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,320
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Young.</font>

661
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,120
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Young.</font>

662
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,760
<font color="yellow">Let's keep working on this.</font>

663
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,120
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

664
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,200
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

665
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,440
<font color="yellow">If you keep fussing, I'm going to kill you.</font>

666
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,120
<font color="yellow">Get some fresh air.</font>

667
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,600
<font color="yellow">Joon Young needs to get some fresh air. He will be back.</font>

668
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,760
<font color="yellow">He has some family issues.</font>

669
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,680
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

670
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,560
<font color="yellow">Please be considerate of him.</font>

671
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

672
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,320
<font color="yellow">Even though our new program is important</font>

673
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,440
<font color="yellow">- we should finish our previous project. - Oh, that's right.</font>

674
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,440
<font color="yellow">You have to meet Director Park today.</font>

675
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,320
<font color="yellow">- What? - You said you were going to</font>

676
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,720
<font color="yellow">- apologize to him in person. - That's right. I was going to do that.</font>

677
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,600
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even know that our program is getting cancelled.</font>

678
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,720
<font color="yellow">Today is the pre-meeting day. You should explain it to him.</font>

679
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,440
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

680
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,400
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

681
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,680
<font color="yellow">We received the money. We will let you know as soon as we find him.</font>

682
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,120
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I'm doing well.</font>

683
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,360
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Happy anniversary.</font>

684
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,080
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, congratulations on your anniversary!</font>

685
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, sister-in-law.</font>

686
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,360
<font color="yellow">- Anniversary? - Oh my.</font>

687
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,320
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, did you forget?</font>

688
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,200
<font color="yellow">No, no, I know.</font>

689
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,000
<font color="yellow">If we were there, we would have thrown you guys a party. We are sorry.</font>

690
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,920
<font color="yellow">Since we're not in the country, it's not that easy.</font>

691
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,200
<font color="yellow">Tell Soo Yeon that I said congratulations.</font>

692
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,320
<font color="yellow">You have to make her the happiest person in the world today.</font>

693
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,600
<font color="yellow">A wedding anniversary is like a dream for a woman. You know that, right?</font>

694
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,080
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

695
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,800
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Bye.</font>

696
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,200
<font color="yellow">She is so loud.</font>

697
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,760
<font color="yellow">Is today your wedding anniversary?</font>

698
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,920
<font color="yellow">Wedding anniversary.</font>

699
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,280
<font color="yellow">There are so many stars.</font>

700
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,720
<font color="yellow">Wow, really...</font>

701
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,240
<font color="yellow">- It feels like it's going to fall on us. - Yes.</font>

702
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,400
<font color="yellow">How about this one? Don't you think Director Park would like it?</font>

703
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,480
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

704
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,680
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get that for your wife?</font>

705
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,040
<font color="yellow">As an anniversary gift?</font>

706
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,120
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

707
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,840
<font color="yellow">She'll remember it forever if you just let it pass.</font>

708
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,040
<font color="yellow">- Bo Young. - Yes?</font>

709
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,480
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. But could you go meet Director Park for me?</font>

710
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,280
<font color="yellow">I could do that...</font>

711
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, I could do that. I will go meet him.</font>

712
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,680
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

713
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,640
<font color="yellow">I put a sketch behind it. Tell her to put her sketch too.</font>

714
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,320
<font color="yellow">I will go to the printing shop and check colors. I will go home from there.</font>

715
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,720
<font color="yellow">Okay. Do you have anything special planned for today? You look happy.</font>

716
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,360
<font color="yellow">A family gathering. I have a lot to prepare. Please do me a favor.</font>

717
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,840
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

718
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,800
<font color="yellow">- It's all done. - Thank you.</font>

719
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,120
<font color="yellow">[My Wife is Having an Affair This Week.]</font>

720
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,840
<font color="yellow">Are you heading to court?</font>

721
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,040
<font color="yellow">Let's find proof, and get everything, including alimony.</font>

722
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,120
<font color="yellow">Apologize for everything you did wrong and beg her not to leave.</font>

723
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,000
<font color="yellow">He would get so many stars if he did a live broadcast.</font>

724
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,480
<font color="yellow">It would be so much fun.</font>

725
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,560
<font color="yellow">Having an affair is like an option these days.</font>

726
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,240
<font color="yellow">I will be waiting for you at the Han River tonight.</font>

727
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,360
<font color="yellow">I understand you.</font>

728
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,000
<font color="yellow">Cheer up.</font>

729
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,480
<font color="yellow">Catch them at the scene and put an end to it.</font>

730
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,880
<font color="yellow">- Hey, let's go. - Okay.</font>

731
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,520
<font color="yellow">Why is she going to a hotel the day after our anniversary?</font>

732
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,120
<font color="yellow">You don't know why?</font>

733
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,320
<font color="yellow">She wants to enjoy her anniversary, and when you are caught off guard</font>

734
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,000
<font color="yellow">she is going to have an affair.</font>

735
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,160
<font color="yellow">That's how clever women are.</font>

736
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,800
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

737
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,480
<font color="yellow">I thought something urgent came up.</font>

738
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,480
<font color="yellow">Oh, I met someone.</font>

739
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,280
<font color="yellow">Did you meet Director Park?</font>

740
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,160
<font color="yellow">How did I end up seeing you here? This is driving me crazy.</font>

741
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,440
<font color="yellow">My studio is close by.</font>

742
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,720
<font color="yellow">You helped me move in there, don't you remember?</font>

743
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,840
<font color="yellow">You're too young to forget those things.</font>

744
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,440
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's okay. You don't have to drink with me.</font>

745
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,840
<font color="yellow">I drink alone often.</font>

746
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,320
<font color="yellow">When I have to get a new light bulb but there's no man in the house.</font>

747
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,320
<font color="yellow">I can't open a jam jar, but there is no man in the house.</font>

748
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,480
<font color="yellow">There was a thief in the area but there's no man in the house, et cetera.</font>

749
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,160
<font color="yellow">What is up with that look?</font>

750
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,240
<font color="yellow">It's like you want to say "you need a bodyguard more than a man."</font>

751
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,000
<font color="yellow">No, it's because you never talk about those things.</font>

752
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,200
<font color="yellow">You've never asked.</font>

753
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,240
<font color="yellow">- I didn't meet Director Park. - What?</font>

754
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,600
<font color="yellow">I called him ahead of time, and he said let's meet next time.</font>

755
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,080
<font color="yellow">He said he is on a trip. It's a celebratory trip.</font>

756
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

757
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,480
<font color="yellow">Yes. He went there as a couple.</font>

758
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,120
<font color="yellow">That trip is to...</font>

759
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,600
<font color="yellow">Celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary.</font>

760
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,560
<font color="yellow">They are amazing.</font>

761
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,480
<font color="yellow">25th anniversary. That is...</font>

762
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,920
<font color="yellow">- Producer Do. - Yes?</font>

763
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:47,080
<font color="yellow">Do you know that the first wedding anniversary is called a "paper wedding"?</font>

764
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,800
<font color="yellow">It's not that well known.</font>

765
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,720
<font color="yellow">But starting with the first wedding anniversary there's a special name to it.</font>

766
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,760
<font color="yellow">Starting with paper, it goes cotton, leather, wood...</font>

767
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:05,520
<font color="yellow">So it goes from something soft to something as hard as silver or gold.</font>

768
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,200
<font color="yellow">Really? Does that have any meaning to it?</font>

769
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,200
<font color="yellow">As time goes on, the couple gets more intimate.</font>

770
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,160
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what that's trying to say?</font>

771
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,640
<font color="yellow">"As time goes on, the couple gets more intimate."</font>

772
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,760
<font color="yellow">Then what is eighth wedding anniversary?</font>

773
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,360
<font color="yellow">- Eighth wedding anniversary? - Yes.</font>

774
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,160
<font color="yellow">It's rubber.</font>

775
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,760
<font color="yellow">Rubber?</font>

776
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,320
<font color="yellow">"A couple that can never be untied."</font>

777
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,240
<font color="yellow">I think that's what that means.</font>

778
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,280
<font color="yellow">Director Park and his wife had so many problems.</font>

779
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,680
<font color="yellow">But they are celebrating their 25th anniversary. They are amazing.</font>

780
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,880
<font color="yellow">You have more than enough time to buy a gift, Producer Do.</font>

781
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,480
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

782
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,720
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Bo Young. I will get going. - Okay.</font>

783
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,240
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

784
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,480
<font color="yellow">Cheer up.</font>

785
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,760
<font color="yellow">Talk? What do you mean you're going to talk with her?</font>

786
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to buy her a gift and celebrate our anniversary.</font>

787
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,840
<font color="yellow">And we are going to be honest and talk.</font>

788
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,680
<font color="yellow">The cake is ready.</font>

789
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,440
<font color="yellow">Be honest?</font>

790
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,000
<font color="yellow">Are you going to forgive Soo Yeon?</font>

791
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,120
<font color="yellow">I have to listen to what she has to say to decide if I'm going to forgive her.</font>

792
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,760
<font color="yellow">Anyway. I'm going to get serious and talk to her.</font>

793
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,640
<font color="yellow">We are a "rubber couple."</font>

794
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,680
<font color="yellow">Rubber? What is that?</font>

795
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,200
<font color="yellow">It's a thing.</font>

796
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,560
<font color="yellow">Since I discussed this with you, I'm just letting you know.</font>

797
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,480
<font color="yellow">How can he just hang up like that?</font>

798
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,840
<font color="yellow">Whatever. He will take care it.</font>

799
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,240
<font color="yellow">It was buy one get one free.</font>

800
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,920
<font color="yellow">It's Jeon Ju Bibimbap. I like spicy pork.</font>

801
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,360
<font color="yellow">- What's yours? - Don't eat it then.</font>

802
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking it back?</font>

803
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,760
<font color="yellow">Did you argue with your wife?</font>

804
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,080
<font color="yellow">You looked like you were feeling down all day today.</font>

805
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,880
<font color="yellow">We don't argue.</font>

806
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,880
<font color="yellow">Is there a couple who does not argue?</font>

807
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,680
<font color="yellow">We respect each other.</font>

808
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,160
<font color="yellow">We don't mind each other's business.</font>

809
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,360
<font color="yellow">You respect each other, so you don't  mind her business.</font>

810
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,200
<font color="yellow">Aren't you just leaving her alone because you don't care about her?</font>

811
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,560
<font color="yellow">Are you saying my wife is leaving me alone?</font>

812
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,000
<font color="yellow">If you feel bad, don't eat these things here.</font>

813
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,760
<font color="yellow">Go home and be nice to your wife.</font>

814
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,040
<font color="yellow">She took my kimbap.</font>

815
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,520
<font color="yellow">I want to eat what you made.</font>

816
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,600
<font color="yellow">Yoon Ki, are you going home? Ah Ra, Yoon Ki is going home now.</font>

817
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,280
<font color="yellow">I have more work to do.</font>

818
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,280
<font color="yellow">He said he has more work to do. I will call you later.</font>

819
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,600
<font color="yellow">Honey, wait just a moment. I will be there soon.</font>

820
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,400
<font color="yellow">Are you not going home?</font>

821
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,600
<font color="yellow">- I have things to do. - Oh.</font>

822
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,080
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you to do anything. You have things to do?</font>

823
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,760
<font color="yellow">- What about you? - I have a dinner meeting.</font>

824
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,760
<font color="yellow">- With who? - With producers.</font>

825
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,320
<font color="yellow">Producers?</font>

826
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,160
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's unlucky.</font>

827
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,560
<font color="yellow">- It's unlucky. - What is unlucky?</font>

828
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,560
<font color="yellow">Just something.</font>

829
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,080
<font color="yellow">- Let me hang out here. - We are having a meeting.</font>

830
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,240
<font color="yellow">Keep going. Don't worry about me.</font>

831
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,440
<font color="yellow">- Keep going. - So do you want to</font>

832
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,920
<font color="yellow">record the talk between the wife and that stranger?</font>

833
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,400
<font color="yellow">- It's clearer that way. - Wait.</font>

834
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,120
<font color="yellow">Huh? You guys are going to get arrested.</font>

835
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,720
<font color="yellow">Protection of Communications Secret Act. Article 14-1.</font>

836
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,640
<font color="yellow">No one can record or phone tap</font>

837
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,040
<font color="yellow">someone else's private calls.</font>

838
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,080
<font color="yellow">Breaking that law could get you between a year and ten years of jail time.</font>

839
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,400
<font color="yellow">- It's illegal? - Does it sound legal to you?</font>

840
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,520
<font color="yellow">What about hidden cameras?</font>

841
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,200
<font color="yellow">It's called "hidden camera" because it is not legal.</font>

842
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,800
<font color="yellow">Filming with a hidden camera is illegal</font>

843
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,760
<font color="yellow">and using the tape without agreement is also illegal.</font>

844
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,920
<font color="yellow">And when you get portrait rights problems in the mix, it gets very complicated.</font>

845
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,360
<font color="yellow">What about the black box in the car?</font>

846
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,280
<font color="yellow">Other than special circumstances, it's okay.</font>

847
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,600
<font color="yellow">Then we should use the black boxes of their cars.</font>

848
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,440
<font color="yellow">If you're not planning on living in the car, you won't get anything.</font>

849
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,120
<font color="yellow">Then what should we do?</font>

850
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,800
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

851
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,920
<font color="yellow">You can just look at the odometer.</font>

852
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,720
<font color="yellow">Those odometers don't lie.</font>

853
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,320
<font color="yellow">"Honey, where were you?" "I went to a meeting in Chungdamdong."</font>

854
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,320
<font color="yellow">Chungdamdong is 15 kilometers away from home.</font>

855
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,440
<font color="yellow">But when you look at the odometer, it says 50 kilometers.</font>

856
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,480
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

857
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,680
<font color="yellow">She went somewhere farther than Chungdamdong.</font>

858
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,920
<font color="yellow">And another thing. When people go to a motel</font>

859
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,160
<font color="yellow">there's that mark on the front of the car.</font>

860
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,040
<font color="yellow">Careless people always miss those things.</font>

861
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,840
<font color="yellow">But since we are pros</font>

862
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,800
<font color="yellow">we look at the back of the car. The plate.</font>

863
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,080
<font color="yellow">When you go to a motel , they hide your plate.</font>

864
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,280
<font color="yellow">Then everywhere expect for the plate is covered with dust.</font>

865
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,080
<font color="yellow">But you can just wash your car.</font>

866
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,520
<font color="yellow">That's why you never improve.</font>

867
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,040
<font color="yellow">My wife washes my car before I go out.</font>

868
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,240
<font color="yellow">But I wash the car my wife already washed.</font>

869
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,720
<font color="yellow">It's 100 percent.</font>

870
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,640
<font color="yellow">One last thing.</font>

871
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,320
<font color="yellow">- Rock. - Rock?</font>

872
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,160
<font color="yellow">All the motels cover their entrance with pebbles.</font>

873
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,600
<font color="yellow">Why would you have pebbles stuck in your tire?</font>

874
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,600
<font color="yellow">It's proof right there.</font>

875
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,920
<font color="yellow">"He went to a motel."</font>

876
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me with those admiring eyes?</font>

877
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,760
<font color="yellow">Those are all from his experience. He's different.</font>

878
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,440
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon. I have never done that. I'm not that kind of person.</font>

879
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,000
<font color="yellow">This is why I wasn't going to say this.</font>

880
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,480
<font color="yellow">Isn't this fun?</font>

881
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,320
<font color="yellow">It's like Sherlock's affair case.</font>

882
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,360
<font color="yellow">It would be fun if we could do something like this at the scene.</font>

883
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,640
<font color="yellow">Do you guys want me to appear on TV? At the scene?</font>

884
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,080
<font color="yellow">But he probably doesn't have time.</font>

885
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,040
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's a bad idea.</font>

886
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,440
<font color="yellow">We can also get legal advice.</font>

887
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,880
<font color="yellow">I'm not busy.</font>

888
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,800
<font color="yellow">That's right. We are a "rubber couple."</font>

889
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,720
<font color="yellow">A rubber couple.</font>

890
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,600
<font color="yellow">Like how she always does on anniversaries</font>

891
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,080
<font color="yellow">she will be cooking something delicious and waiting for me.</font>

892
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,200
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's take this as a chance</font>

893
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,440
<font color="yellow">to remind ourselves how much we love each other.</font>

894
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,160
<font color="yellow">Then the wind will stop.</font>

895
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,880
<font color="yellow">And we can be happy again.</font>

896
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,480
<font color="yellow">Right, Soo Yeon?</font>

897
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,560
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

898
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,280
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

899
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,040
<font color="yellow">Is this a surprise?</font>

900
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,840
<font color="yellow">I'm going to turn the light on.</font>

901
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,440
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>
