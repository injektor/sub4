the meeting room. We'll have a meeting.</font>

for a new program?</font>

69
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:04,314
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
I'll finish it today and show it to you.</font>

70
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:05,869
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

71
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,502
<font color="yellow">Okay then.</font>

72
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:12,326
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, let's go to the editing room.</font>

73
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:15,299

- Oh, okay.</font>

74

<font color="yellow">What's with you?
Are you not feeling well?</font>

75
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:31,393
<font color="yellow">You've never been late on assignments.</font>

76
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:35,441
<font color="yellow">We've worked together for eight years,
and it's never happened.</font>

77
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,523
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that.</font>

78
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:48,934
<font color="yellow">I'm glad that Hyun Woo came back.</font>

79
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:54,984
<font color="yellow">He wasn't able to focus on work at all,
but he's working really hard today.</font>

80
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:57,677
<font color="yellow">I guess it was meant
to turn out for the better.</font>

81
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:02,660
<font color="yellow">The incident became the critical turning
point for them to make up.</font>

82
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,864
<font color="yellow">Are they back at the old place...</font>

83
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:10,222
<font color="yellow">or are they trying their hardest
to return to their old place?</font>

84
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,389
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean by that?</font>

85
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,263
<font color="yellow">I already got the building.
Should I take off?</font>

86
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:25,677
<font color="yellow">Should I beg?</font>

87
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:28,321
<font color="yellow">I can't even make the calculation.</font>

88
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:31,516
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

89
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:34,396
<font color="yellow">I guess you haven't heard yet.</font>

90
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:36,900
<font color="yellow">Haven't heard what?</font>

91
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,477
<font color="yellow">I've decided to close this office.</font>

92
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,670
<font color="yellow">Why would you close my office?</font>

93
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,283
<font color="yellow">Not anymore.</font>

94
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:47,396
<font color="yellow">If you need anything, pack it up today.</font>

95
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,735
<font color="yellow">I have to get another tenant soon.</font>

96
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,549
<font color="yellow">Honey...</font>

97
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:57,900
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to also
leave me with the car key.</font>

98
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,150
<font color="yellow">You're a professional, aren't you?
Let's finish this like professionals.</font>

99
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,057
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

100
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:16,780

of paying for the cellphone.</font>

103

<font color="yellow">I keep having lingering thoughts.</font>

104
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:49,685
<font color="yellow">I can't have lingering feelings.</font>

105
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,009
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

106
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,157
<font color="yellow">The returning window is over.</font>

107
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,956

because you signed up for three years.</font>

112
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,725
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to see Yoon Ki?</font>

113
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:45,268
<font color="yellow">So you've known it all along?</font>

114
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,457
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to tell you.</font>

115

<font color="yellow">You don't need to console me.</font>

116

<font color="yellow">I don't need to be consoled.</font>

117

a sudden did you decide on divorce?</font>

you've known it all along.</font>

119
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,164
<font color="yellow">So why all of a sudden...</font>

120
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,431
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was becoming a monster.</font>

<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

122
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:18,590
<font color="yellow">I've been lying to myself all along.
And to him.</font>

123
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:23,802
<font color="yellow">When I smelled another woman's makeup
on his shirt</font>

124
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:26,700
<font color="yellow">I thought, "a female client
must've come by his office."</font>

125
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,460
<font color="yellow">Even when I saw a friendly conversation
on his phone</font>

126
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,999
<font color="yellow">I thought, "she must be a good friend
of his that I don't know."</font>

127
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:37,287
<font color="yellow">That's how I lied to myself
and looked the other way.</font>

128
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:42,154
<font color="yellow">Because I loved him, because I couldn't
go on without him.</font>

129
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:45,409
<font color="yellow">I pretended to be a better woman.</font>

130
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,908
<font color="yellow">"Since I'm really good at cooking"</font>

131
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:54,134
<font color="yellow">"let me make more delicious foods
and make him happy."</font>

132
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:58,643
<font color="yellow">"And... make myself happy, too."</font>

133
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:07,561
<font color="yellow">But no matter how much I pretend,
it jumps out unexpectedly.</font>

134
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:14,106
<font color="yellow">Even as I was trimming vegetables,
cutting meat, boiling a soup for him</font>

135
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:18,388
<font color="yellow">"He must be holding another woman."</font>

136
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:22,158
<font color="yellow">"He must be undressing another woman."</font>

137
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:28,556
<font color="yellow">"He must be kissing
another woman's neck."</font>

138
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:32,856
<font color="yellow">When those thoughts pop up suddenly...</font>

139
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:42,512
<font color="yellow">I cursed my heart out at him.</font>

140
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:46,215
<font color="yellow">I loved him,
and I wanted to be loved by him.</font>

141
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:49,931
<font color="yellow">But I cursed at him using the words
I can't even bring up here.</font>

142
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:54,581
<font color="yellow">Sometimes I was smiling as I was
watching him eating my food.</font>

143
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,356
<font color="yellow">At the same time, I wished him
to die right there and then.</font>

144
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:05,735
<font color="yellow">He did wrong, but I obsessed over him
and doubted him endlessly.</font>

145
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:13,604
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm turning into a monster
as I curse at the man that I love.</font>

146
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:21,656
<font color="yellow">And I hated myself for...
becoming that way.</font>

147
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:24,024
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself.</font>

148
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:27,538
<font color="yellow">I don't blame myself.
I don't regret it either.</font>

149
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,407
<font color="yellow">Because I don't love him anymore.</font>

<font color="yellow">their identities are revealed
and get on the news...</font>

361
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:34,958

to help them erase those records.</font>

378
00:30:26,777 --> 00:30:30,082
<font color="yellow">I wonder why I worked so hard
to make a living.</font>

379
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,338
<font color="yellow">I feel like my life is over.</font>

380
00:30:33,338 --> 00:30:38,817
<font color="yellow">Right...
divorce makes people feel really empty.</font>

381
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,629
<font color="yellow">What did Joon Soo say?</font>

382
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:44,544
<font color="yellow">I haven't been able to tell him yet.</font>

383
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:49,459
<font color="yellow">Doesn't the divorce planner
do things like that for me?</font>

384
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:53,596
<font color="yellow">Telling my friends and family
that I'm divorced.</font>

385
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:57,270
<font color="yellow">That is really an issue.</font>

386
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,552
<font color="yellow">When and how would you notify whom?</font>

387
00:31:01,552 --> 00:31:04,577
<font color="yellow">Don't drag it out.
Do it quickly and get it over with.</font>

388
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:09,455
<font color="yellow">The longer you drag it out, the harder
it is to bring it up.</font>

<font color="yellow">we're eating together,
playing games together</font>

394

397
00:31:44,012 --> 00:31:46,129

398
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:48,337

399
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:53,296
<font color="yellow">I like you, Producer Ahn.</font>

400
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:59,117
<font color="yellow">How can you say things like that
while you're eating radish kimchi?</font>

401
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,131
<font color="yellow">But I don't want to date you.</font>

402
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:04,296
<font color="yellow">Then what?</font>

403
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:06,438
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get married?</font>

404
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,569
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

405
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,732
<font color="yellow">I do like you...</font>

406
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:16,587
<font color="yellow">but it's hard for me to have
a relationship with another person.</font>

407
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,515
<font color="yellow">I've also failed at my marriage.
So I do understand it's hard for you--</font>

408
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:24,560
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing this because I'm divorced.</font>

409
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,630
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

410
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,476
<font color="yellow">I told you already
that I have a problem with relationships.</font>

411
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:35,651
<font color="yellow">I can't give you
a normal feedback on emotions.</font>

412
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,940
<font color="yellow">And I don't really know
what to do with my own emotions.</font>

413
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,652
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

414
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:44,512
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

415
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:48,283
<font color="yellow">I'm annoyed and tired
to waste my feelings</font>

416
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:50,194
<font color="yellow">so I don't want to do it anymore.</font>

417
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:54,388
<font color="yellow">Are you tired when you're with me?</font>

418
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:59,120
<font color="yellow">When we talk, when we eat together...</font>

419
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,623
<font color="yellow">are you tired of those?</font>

420
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,371
<font color="yellow">When I was pretending to be married</font>

421
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:14,772
<font color="yellow">I thought to myself,
I'd never love anyone again.</font>

422
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:20,446
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I was tired of everything
and didn't care for anything.</font>

423
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,947
<font color="yellow">But with you, I'm okay, Bo Young.</font>

424
00:33:29,435 --> 00:33:32,416
<font color="yellow">I was hurt, and I closed my doors.</font>

425
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,087
<font color="yellow">But it healed.</font>

426
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:42,235
<font color="yellow">I remembered again
how nice it is to like someone.</font>

427
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:47,088
<font color="yellow">I want to find those feelings
for you as well.</font>

428
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:51,283
<font color="yellow">No, don't do that, Producer Ahn.</font>

429
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:57,121
<font color="yellow">Aren't we already heading
to some sort of relationship?</font>

430
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,954
<font color="yellow">It's not like we don't
have any relationship.</font>

431
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,903
<font color="yellow">Let's date, Bo Young.</font>

432
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,456
<font color="yellow">Don't say that while you're eating
radish kimchi. It's annoying.</font>

433
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:25,463
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

434
00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:30,124
<font color="yellow">You don't like it
because I'm eating radish kimchi?</font>

435
00:34:30,124 --> 00:34:32,088
<font color="yellow">Okay okay, then...</font>

436
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:36,528
<font color="yellow">Let's date.</font>

437
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:39,508
<font color="yellow">I said, let's date.</font>

438
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:41,164
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

439
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:45,093
<font color="yellow">You don't want to
because of radish kimchi?</font>

440
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:46,599
<font color="yellow">You're leaving because
you don't like radish kimchi?</font>

441
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,901
<font color="yellow">It's because of radish kimchi!</font>

442
00:34:56,912 --> 00:35:00,198
<font color="yellow">- This is what Joon Soo likes...
- Wow, it's chocolate cake!</font>

443
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:04,356
<font color="yellow">- Joon Soo, say, "thank you"!
- Thank you, Grandma!</font>

444
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:07,673
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what to get.</font>

445
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:10,941
<font color="yellow">So I just bought some cake Joon Soo
likes at the bakery nearby.</font>

446
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,981
<font color="yellow">Did you have fun at the hot spring?</font>

447
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:16,530
<font color="yellow">Wow, this was my first time there,
and it was really nice.</font>

448
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,372
<font color="yellow">Next time, let's all go together.</font>

449
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:23,838
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

450
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,274
<font color="yellow">We have something to tell you.</font>

451
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:53,231
<font color="yellow">Mom, we are--</font>

452
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:57,001
<font color="yellow">You haven't seen this picture, have you?</font>

453
00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:01,075
<font color="yellow">I took this near the arboretum.</font>

454
00:36:03,263 --> 00:36:04,414
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

455
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,946
<font color="yellow">Hey, it was amazing.</font>

456
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:11,566
<font color="yellow">If you walk up a bit,
there is a view of a reservoir!</font>

457
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:14,169
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

458
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:17,423
<font color="yellow">We...</font>

459
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,336
<font color="yellow">We decided to get divorced.</font>

460
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:29,787
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother.</font>

461
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:31,923
<font color="yellow">You can't.</font>

462
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,870
<font color="yellow">I will never approve of it.</font>

463
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,622
<font color="yellow">Just what is the reason?</font>

464
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:41,115
<font color="yellow">Did Hyun Woo say he can't forgive you?
Is that it?</font>

465
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:45,579
<font color="yellow">- Do Hyun Woo, are you really--
- Mother, it's not like that.</font>

466
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,600
<font color="yellow">Then why are you getting divorced?</font>

467
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,908
<font color="yellow">He will forgive you for everything.</font>

468
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,162
<font color="yellow">He will let it go for you!</font>

469
00:36:55,751 --> 00:36:57,350
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

470
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,660
<font color="yellow">I understood you.</font>

471
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,613
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to consider
only yourself all the way?</font>

472
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,749
<font color="yellow">What about Joon Soo? What are you
going to do about Joon Soo?</font>

473
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:11,345
<font color="yellow">What did that little one do wrong?</font>

474
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:15,097
<font color="yellow">Change your mind
even just for Joon Soo's sake.</font>

475
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:16,742
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

476
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:19,273
<font color="yellow">We've already made up our minds.</font>

477
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:21,238
<font color="yellow">You can't!</font>

478
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:26,365
<font color="yellow">I cannot accept it.</font>

479
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:05,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

480
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,309
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

481
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:09,740
<font color="yellow">Why would you be?</font>

482
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,825
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who is sorry.</font>

483
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,890
<font color="yellow">No, Father.</font>

484
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,490
<font color="yellow">I'm responsible for most of it.</font>

485
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:28,735
<font color="yellow">I... wasn't able to make her happy.</font>

486
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:33,789
<font color="yellow">When I took Soo Yeon...</font>

487
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:38,695
<font color="yellow">I pledged that I'd make her
the happiest person.</font>

488
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,649
<font color="yellow">But I wasn't able to keep the promise.</font>

489
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:47,314
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

490
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:07,296
<font color="yellow">- Mom, I'll go ride the bike with Dad.
- Okay, be careful out there.</font>

491
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:09,503
<font color="yellow">- See you later.
- See you.</font>

492
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:47,387
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

493
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,919
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

494
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:56,191
<font color="yellow">Dad and Mom...</font>

495
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:05,258
<font color="yellow">we've decided to live apart now.</font>

496
00:40:05,258 --> 00:40:06,979
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

497
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:09,263
<font color="yellow">Because we'll be happier that way.</font>

498
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:16,629
<font color="yellow">You will live with Mom from now on,
Joon Soo.</font>

499
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:21,155
<font color="yellow">But you can see me anytime you want.</font>

500
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,836
<font color="yellow">Even if we live apart,
I'm always your dad.</font>

501
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:33,017
<font color="yellow">What have I always told you?</font>

502
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:36,709
<font color="yellow">When I'm not around, Joon Soo is...</font>

503
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:40,244
<font color="yellow">Instead of you, I have to protect Mom.</font>

504
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:51,173
<font color="yellow">I have to stay apart from your mom now...</font>

505
00:40:55,417 --> 00:41:00,841
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, you have to protect Mom.</font>

506
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:13,517
<font color="yellow">Mom's working too hard by herself.</font>

507
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:17,372
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

508
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:19,778
<font color="yellow">Okay? Men don't cry.</font>

509
00:41:21,635 --> 00:41:24,399
<font color="yellow">You'll go to elementary school soon,
right?</font>

510
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,930
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you can do well.</font>

511
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,169
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you to take care of Mom.</font>

512
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:44,198
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

513
00:41:57,367 --> 00:42:00,624
<font color="yellow">For these reasons, we believe</font>

514
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:03,879
<font color="yellow">the requested property division
and alimony are justified.</font>

515
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:05,441
<font color="yellow">That's all I have.</font>

516
00:42:06,898 --> 00:42:09,218
<font color="yellow">Defendant, anything you'd like to say?</font>

517
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:11,249
<font color="yellow">Yes, we do.</font>

518
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:14,901
<font color="yellow">I think it'll go well.
I think we'll get more alimony.</font>

519
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:19,445
<font color="yellow">Yes, we have evidence that the plaintiff</font>

520
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:22,617
<font color="yellow">had no will to raise children
or to do housework.</font>

521
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:26,298
<font color="yellow">Most of those claims are bluffing.</font>

522
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:28,108
<font color="yellow">Please look at the submitted photos.</font>

523
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:30,033
<font color="yellow">What are these photos?</font>

524
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:33,149
<font color="yellow">Those photos prove that the plaintiff</font>

525
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:36,265
<font color="yellow">provided reasons to break up the family.</font>

526
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,937
<font color="yellow">If you look at the presented photo</font>

527
00:42:38,937 --> 00:42:41,974
<font color="yellow">the plaintiff has had a relationship
with Attorney Choi Yoon Ki</font>

528
00:42:41,974 --> 00:42:44,957
<font color="yellow">for the past few months
before the divorce.</font>

529
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:46,704
<font color="yellow">The photos show the status
of that relationship.</font>

530
00:42:46,704 --> 00:42:49,898
<font color="yellow">Your Honor, we have other photos as well.</font>

531
00:42:49,898 --> 00:42:51,079
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

532
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:53,356
<font color="yellow">Based on the evidence,
it shows the plaintiff</font>

533
00:42:53,356 --> 00:42:55,633
<font color="yellow">had no will to continue the marriage.</font>

534
00:42:55,633 --> 00:43:00,102
<font color="yellow">And that her contribution
to the property is very low.</font>

535
00:43:07,702 --> 00:43:09,173
<font color="yellow">Does the furnace work well?</font>

536
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,573
<font color="yellow">No, the house is not facing south.</font>

537
00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:12,591
<font color="yellow">It's facing east.</font>

538
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,878
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too close to the next building?
It looks like they can see everything.</font>

539
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:17,651
<font color="yellow">And the walls...</font>

540
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:23,968
<font color="yellow">Is it molded inside the walls?</font>

541
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:28,780
<font color="yellow">Is this a cockroach?</font>

542
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,349
<font color="yellow">How can there be a cockroach?</font>

543
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:31,919
<font color="yellow">If there is one, more will keep coming!</font>

544
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:34,542
<font color="yellow">The mom will flip out
when she sees the roach...</font>

545
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:37,986
<font color="yellow">The security cameras are here,
here, and there?</font>

546
00:43:37,986 --> 00:43:39,282
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

547
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:41,713
<font color="yellow">There shouldn't be
any blind spots, right?</font>

548
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:43,459
<font color="yellow">You're really detailed.</font>

549
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:45,323
<font color="yellow">Oh, how many people are moving in?</font>

550
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,039
<font color="yellow">Did you say it's three of you,
with your wife and the child?</font>

551
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,483
<font color="yellow">It will be two. The mom and the child.</font>

552
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,231
<font color="yellow">Relax. Don't worry.</font>

553
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:59,153
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset, it's my money!</font>

554
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:04,349
<font color="yellow">I will buy everything you want
and get everything you want to do.</font>

555
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,178
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry!</font>

556
00:44:06,178 --> 00:44:08,950
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Of course!</font>

557
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,436
<font color="yellow">Did you forget? I have a building.</font>

558
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:13,867
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

559
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,838
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Yoon Ki.
The shoes are so pretty.</font>

560
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:20,138
<font color="yellow">Aren't they? Wait, is it okay for me
to buy the shoes for you?</font>

561
00:44:20,138 --> 00:44:22,320
<font color="yellow">Would Bo Ram run away from me
wearing these shoes?</font>

562
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,046
<font color="yellow">Then you can buy me another pair. So that
I can come back to you wearing those.</font>

563
00:44:25,046 --> 00:44:28,698
<font color="yellow">Choose one more pair.
For you to return to me.</font>

564
00:44:28,698 --> 00:44:29,963
<font color="yellow">Take a look!</font>

565
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:32,178
<font color="yellow">Mr. Choi Yoon Ki!</font>

566
00:44:32,178 --> 00:44:34,477
<font color="yellow">Mr. Choi Yoon Ki, are you inside?</font>

567
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:35,816
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

568
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:38,600
<font color="yellow">- Are you Mr. Choi Yoon Ki?
- Yes, I'm Choi Yoon Ki.</font>

569
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,729
<font color="yellow">Please take this.</font>

570
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:44,325
<font color="yellow">And sign here.</font>

571
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:46,928
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

572
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:50,198
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.
It looks like it's from the court.</font>

573
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:56,930
<font color="yellow">Why would I hand over my building
and my land to you?</font>

574
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,765
<font color="yellow">It's not your land.</font>

575
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:00,983
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you to give it to me
because it's my land.</font>

576
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:03,225
<font color="yellow">There are the land registry
and property tax record</font>

577
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:05,468
<font color="yellow">during the Japanese occupation period.</font>

578
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:07,187
<font color="yellow">Are we making up stuff?</font>

579
00:45:09,653 --> 00:45:11,434
<font color="yellow">You saw the certified copy of
the land registry, didn't you?</font>

580
00:45:11,434 --> 00:45:16,303
<font color="yellow">My name Choi Yoon Ki is written on there!</font>

581
00:45:16,303 --> 00:45:19,242
<font color="yellow">This is definitely my building, my land!</font>

582
00:45:19,242 --> 00:45:21,461
<font color="yellow">During the Japanese occupation period?</font>

583
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:23,394
<font color="yellow">Why bring up, "once upon a time"?</font>

584
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:26,450
<font color="yellow">Even if you can't accept it,
you don't have a choice.</font>

585
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,899
<font color="yellow">We'll just follow the law.</font>

586
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:31,079
<font color="yellow">What does this all mean?</font>

587
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:37,378
<font color="yellow">Demolish the unlicensed building
built on my land, and get out!</font>

588
00:45:37,378 --> 00:45:40,403
<font color="yellow">How can I demolish such a big building?</font>

589
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:42,622
<font color="yellow">We have tenants there!</font>

590
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:45,570
<font color="yellow">Tear down the building? You mean,
we should get rid of our building?</font>

591
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,167
<font color="yellow">It's not our concern.
Since you've used our land</font>

592
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,765
<font color="yellow">so far without our permission...</font>

593
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:53,269
<font color="yellow">we will request for compensation for it.</font>

594
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:58,736
<font color="yellow">What does he mean? Is he going to
take away our building?</font>

595
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:01,224
<font color="yellow">Please stay calm.</font>

596
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:22,425
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon! What a coincidence!</font>

597
00:46:25,943 --> 00:46:29,189
<font color="yellow">The food here is great,
so I come here alone often.</font>

598
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:33,532
<font color="yellow">You waited for me, didn't you?
I told you not to do this!</font>

599
00:46:33,532 --> 00:46:35,354
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, I waited for you?</font>

600
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:37,479
<font color="yellow">I happened to run into you
as I was leaving after drinking.</font>

601
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:39,602
<font color="yellow">It's a coincidence.</font>

602
00:46:39,602 --> 00:46:41,459
<font color="yellow">Your nose is red.</font>

603
00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:44,410
<font color="yellow">If you were going to wait for me,
you should've waited inside!</font>

604
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,803
<font color="yellow">Why are you so foolish?</font>

605
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,064
<font color="yellow">I guess you're not
feeling well these days.</font>

606
00:46:49,064 --> 00:46:50,888
<font color="yellow">You haven't come here to drink at all.</font>

607
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,742
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Where?</font>

608
00:46:54,742 --> 00:46:58,849
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. And you should warm up.</font>

609
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:03,591
<font color="yellow">If you tell me to go, of course I will.</font>

610
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:09,137
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

611
00:47:15,887 --> 00:47:18,186
<font color="yellow">Were you out somewhere?
I thought you were home.</font>

612
00:47:18,186 --> 00:47:21,490
<font color="yellow">You waited for me without knowing
whether I'm home or not?</font>

613
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:26,231
<font color="yellow">Yes. I thought you might not like it
if I rang the door bell.</font>

614
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:30,332
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd be thankful if I happened
to run into you. If not, that's fine.</font>

615
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:34,097
<font color="yellow">I just walked around
the neighborhood a few times.</font>

616
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:36,439
<font color="yellow">You're working out?
You must be on a diet!</font>

617
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:40,274
<font color="yellow">Now that I think about it, you've been
nibbling small bites these days.</font>

618
00:47:44,515 --> 00:47:46,225
<font color="yellow">Producer Ahn.</font>

619
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,807
<font color="yellow">You want to date me?</font>

620
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:55,577
<font color="yellow">You were embarrassed to say it,
so you haven't been able to say it!</font>

621
00:47:55,577 --> 00:48:00,052
<font color="yellow">If you want to date me, eat the noodles.</font>

622
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:02,122
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, drink water.</font>

623
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,350
<font color="yellow">What is it then?</font>

624
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:08,925
<font color="yellow">Why do you take so long to say it?</font>

625
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:10,664
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to date me</font>

626
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:12,405
<font color="yellow">you've already told me several times,
so you don't have to say it.</font>

627
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:16,678
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me
not to come here and wait for you.</font>

628
00:48:16,678 --> 00:48:18,680
<font color="yellow">I'm not bothering you or anything--</font>

629
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,378
<font color="yellow">I'm pregnant.</font>

630
00:48:22,937 --> 00:48:24,401
<font color="yellow">Pregnant?</font>

631
00:48:25,675 --> 00:48:27,660
<font color="yellow">I'm not bothering you or anything--</font>

632
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,347
<font color="yellow">I'm pregnant.</font>

633
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:33,314
<font color="yellow">Pregnant?</font>

634
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:36,224
<font color="yellow">Who is?</font>

635
00:48:36,224 --> 00:48:37,722
<font color="yellow">You heard me.
Don't make me say it again.</font>

636
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:40,425
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

637
00:48:43,396 --> 00:48:45,325
<font color="yellow">Who is the father?</font>

638
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,820
<font color="yellow">Me? Me?</font>

639
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,414
<font color="yellow">It's me?</font>

640
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:55,138
<font color="yellow">No no, I don't remember--</font>

641
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:57,524
<font color="yellow">The day we had grilled clams...</font>

642
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,394
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- Here!</font>

643
00:49:02,394 --> 00:49:04,994
<font color="yellow">Let's go have another drink at my place.</font>

644
00:49:04,994 --> 00:49:08,033
<font color="yellow"><i>Why did you come to my place?</i></font>

645
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:10,950
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.</i></font>

646
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:16,146
<font color="yellow">I thought about it...</font>

647
00:49:17,227 --> 00:49:20,146
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have it.
That's why I'm telling you.</font>

648
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,809
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait. I'm not getting this.</font>

649
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:30,211
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

650
00:49:30,211 --> 00:49:33,013
<font color="yellow">That's how I've been
for the past few weeks.</font>

651
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:40,791
<font color="yellow">Okay. There is nothing more
to think about.</font>

652
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,725
<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

653
00:49:42,725 --> 00:49:46,035
<font color="yellow">You don't need to take responsibility
for the child.</font>

654
00:49:46,035 --> 00:49:48,171
<font color="yellow">I was afraid you'd think that way.
That's why I haven't told you until now.</font>

655
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:54,131
<font color="yellow">Whether we have a child or not,
I want to be by your side.</font>

656
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,273
<font color="yellow">To be honest with you,
I have no feelings</font>

657
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:02,974
<font color="yellow">for the baby
that just popped up suddenly.</font>

658
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:06,591
<font color="yellow">It doesn't even feel real, but...</font>

659
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:10,597
<font color="yellow">If you decided to have it...</font>

660
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:14,796
<font color="yellow">I'd like to be by your side
for both of you.</font>

661
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,468
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to get married.</font>

662
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:20,104
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

663
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:23,160
<font color="yellow">I can't. The baby and marriage
are separate issues.</font>

664
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,376
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

665
00:50:25,376 --> 00:50:28,878
<font color="yellow">People get married in this situation!</font>

666
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:33,008
<font color="yellow">- Let's get married.
- I won't get married!</font>

667
00:50:33,008 --> 00:50:36,968
<font color="yellow">How can you say
that you can't get married?</font>

668
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:39,615
<font color="yellow">You can't do this.</font>

669
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:41,937
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married no matter what.</font>

670
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:16,921
<font color="yellow">- Did you pack up the books?
- Not yet.</font>

671
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:21,660
<font color="yellow">- Then I'll pack your books.
- Okay, thank you.</font>

672
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:28,289
<font color="yellow">Wait. You can't leave things like this.
It will break.</font>

673
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,941
<font color="yellow">I'll leave this here.</font>

674
00:51:36,941 --> 00:51:38,249
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

675
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:44,921
<font color="yellow">You'll see Joon Soo anyway, but still...</font>

676
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:03,847
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

677
00:52:03,847 --> 00:52:05,883
<font color="yellow">- You should.
- You should.</font>

678
00:52:08,323 --> 00:52:10,240
<font color="yellow">Your birthdate is written on it.</font>

679
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:30,696
<font color="yellow">Are you okay without my help?</font>

680
00:52:30,696 --> 00:52:35,508
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.
The movers will take care of everything.</font>

681
00:52:35,508 --> 00:52:38,519
<font color="yellow">- Still...
- It's okay.</font>

682
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:40,477
<font color="yellow">You should go. You'll be late.</font>

683
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:44,974
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'm leaving.</font>

684
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:05,901
<font color="yellow">We're done. You can leave right away.</font>

685
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:07,151
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

686
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:35,267
<font color="yellow"><i>Joon Soo, you'll grow this tall. Okay?</i></font>

687
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:50,845
<font color="yellow">Honey, is it ready yet?</font>

688
00:53:50,845 --> 00:53:53,028
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll be done soon! Hold on!</font>

689
00:53:56,193 --> 00:53:58,151
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. I'm hungry...</font>

690
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,370
<font color="yellow">Honey, hold on for a minute.</font>

691
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,555
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry!</font>

692
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:11,441
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'll be done soon.
Wait for a minute!</font>

693
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:14,767
<font color="yellow">Wow, it looks good.</font>

694
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:31,994
<font color="yellow">- So, this is everything.
- Yes.</font>

695
00:54:31,994 --> 00:54:34,869
<font color="yellow">It took three hours...</font>

696
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,995
<font color="yellow">It must be really good since it took
three hours to make it.</font>

697
00:54:42,162 --> 00:54:43,504
<font color="yellow"><i>Thank you!</i></font>

700
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:54,178
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

701
00:54:54,178 --> 00:54:57,041
<font color="yellow">I think I'm pregnant.</font>

702
00:55:14,454 --> 00:55:16,664

703
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:17,571

704
00:56:17,571 --> 00:56:18,834

Can I ask?</font>

01:00:00,082 --> 01:00:01,481
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

730
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:07,713
