Sure, let's get divorced!</font>

00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:16,167
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you follow me out
of the hotel room?</font>

4
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,170
<font color="yellow">Why did you stay with that bastard?</font>

5
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:23,632
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with him?
I'm asking if you slept with him!</font>

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:25,905
<font color="yellow">Yes, I slept with him.</font>

7
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:31,721
<font color="yellow">I missed him.
I've wanted to see him the whole time.</font>

8
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:34,276
<font color="yellow">So I contacted him first.</font>

00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:06,751

00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,597
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Mother.</font>

14
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:12,362
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo! You have to go
to kindergarten. Let's get up!</font>

15
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:20,296
<font color="yellow">This is the back.</font>

16
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:28,573
<font color="yellow">Jung Soo Yeon, you didn't
really mean it, did you?</font>

17
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:33,180
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything to say?</font>

Let's get divorced!</font>

20
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:41,725
<font color="yellow">Don't ever think of coming home again.</font>

00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:44,945
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want,
you cold-blooded people!</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Ji Sun Woo.</font>

00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:14,734
<font color="yellow">No, I'll come in now.</font>

24
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:23,402
<font color="yellow">It looks like I should head out first.</font>

25
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:28,056
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

26
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:55,461
<font color="yellow">Mom. Mom!</font>

27
00:02:58,283 --> 00:03:00,070
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, your arm.</font>

28
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,810
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Yes?</font>

<font color="yellow">Yoon Woo goes to an art academy.</font>

30
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:17,033
<font color="yellow">He says he throws paint colors and
makes dinosaurs with colored papers.</font>

31
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,641
<font color="yellow">Do you also want to go
to the art academy?</font>

32
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:25,979
<font color="yellow">Not necessarily...</font>

33
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:31,961
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll let you go.</font>

34
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,205
<font color="yellow">- Oh, yes!
- Oh, yes!</font>

35
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:38,381
<font color="yellow">My wife had an affair.</font>

36
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:42,677
<font color="yellow">But I haven't heard anything from
my wife that could convince me.</font>

37
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:47,807
<font color="yellow">I cannot forgive my wife
or that bastard.</font>

38
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,082
<font color="yellow">Today...</font>

39
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:56,062
<font color="yellow">I will fight the bastard who took
away the most precious thing I have.</font>

40
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,581
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to make you wait.</font>

41
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:29,958
<font color="yellow">I'm Ji Sun Woo.</font>

42
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,803
<font color="yellow">I didn't come here to exchange names!</font>

43
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,411
<font color="yellow">I have questions to ask,
so answer me honestly.</font>

44
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:43,857
<font color="yellow">I hear it's been six months.</font>

45
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:48,584
<font color="yellow">You have a family, too.
What on earth were you thinking...</font>

46
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:00,175
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!</font>

47
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:06,125
<font color="yellow">Our lovely manager!
Happy birthday to you!</font>

48
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:17,475
<font color="yellow">You seriously celebrated his birthday?</font>

49
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:19,172
<font color="yellow">I didn't sing. I just clapped.</font>

50
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,365
<font color="yellow">Jeez.</font>

51
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:23,519
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
My hand went up before I knew it.</font>

52
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,161
<font color="yellow">You're so pathetic.</font>

53
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,512
<font color="yellow">So you celebrated his birthday
and just left?</font>

54
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:31,877
<font color="yellow">So you did. What else did you do?</font>

55
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:36,492
<font color="yellow">Look here and smile! Kimchi!</font>

56
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:40,579
<font color="yellow">Mr. Guest, please smile. Kimchi!</font>

57
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,204
<font color="yellow">You crazy bastard!</font>

58
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:46,303
<font color="yellow">What? Have you lost your mind?</font>

59
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:49,165
<font color="yellow">Hey, you deserve to be cursed.</font>

60
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:53,088
<font color="yellow">Why don't you frame that picture
and hang it up in your living room?</font>

61
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:55,201
<font color="yellow">It'll be a great memory for you.</font>

62
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:59,639
<font color="yellow">Whatever you're thinking,
don't do it. Just don't.</font>

63
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,612
<font color="yellow">Just do what I tell you to do.</font>

64
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:06,915
<font color="yellow">Go back to him. And as soon as
you see him, give him a punch. Okay?</font>

65
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:09,600
<font color="yellow">What? Is this how you'd punch him?</font>

66
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,735
<font color="yellow">- Huh?
- Yes.</font>

67
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:13,779
<font color="yellow">You can't learn to fight from books.
You'll crack your wrist this way.</font>

68
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:19,413
<font color="yellow">Hold it like this.
Hold it like this and punch him.</font>

69
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,435
<font color="yellow">What is this, a funny joke with a punch?</font>

70
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:25,766
<font color="yellow">What if he attacks back at you?
Like this, here?</font>

71
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,552
<font color="yellow">- Like this?
- Yes!</font>

72
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:31,898
<font color="yellow">It happens a lot.
You punch him this way, then like this!</font>

73
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:35,834
<font color="yellow">It doesn't hurt,
so I'll take control this way. Then...</font>

74
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,345
<font color="yellow">And here comes another one.</font>

75
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,386
<font color="yellow">- I have a free hand.
- Really?</font>

76
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:43,033
<font color="yellow">Then would I stay still? Here, here!
Here it comes!</font>

77
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:47,721
<font color="yellow">If I take the two hands like this,
you can't do anything anymore.</font>

78
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:51,144
<font color="yellow">Then I can do this, and attack this way.</font>

79
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,105
<font color="yellow">I'd pretend to hit here,
but actually hit here.</font>

80
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:54,391
<font color="yellow">- Are you done?
- That's right.</font>

81
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:57,423
<font color="yellow">Then I'd go like this.</font>

82
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:00,791
<font color="yellow">You seem strong, but if I go this way...</font>

83
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,146
<font color="yellow">Then I'd go this way.</font>

84
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:03,906
<font color="yellow">Then I'd hit this way and also here too.</font>

85
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:06,050
<font color="yellow">What will you do if I hit you here?</font>

86
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,598
<font color="yellow">Stay right there.</font>

87
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:25,596
<font color="yellow">If you take revenge on the man,
your wife may despise you.</font>

88
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:29,470
<font color="yellow">What you have to do is face your wife,
not take revenge.</font>

89
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,795
<font color="yellow">Revenge is for cowards.</font>

90
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:33,406
<font color="yellow">What? Cowards?</font>

91
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:36,291
<font color="yellow">It's about being upset,
not being a coward, ----</font>

92
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:46,536
<font color="yellow">Here is Buddha. Tuna Mayo, you should
get the Nobel Peace Prize.</font>

93
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:49,002
<font color="yellow">Tuna Mayo, stop trying to get attention
and get out of here.</font>

94
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,524
<font color="yellow">You must be a woman, taking her side.
You wouldn't say that if you were a man.</font>

95
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:55,891
<font color="yellow">Tuna Mayo, are you a woman?
Wow, this is a hit.</font>

96
00:07:55,891 --> 00:08:00,865
<font color="yellow">A coward? Sure, a married woman who has
an affair is brave, according to you.</font>

97
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:04,843
<font color="yellow">You're the brave one
for having gone to him.</font>

98
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,596
<font color="yellow">Don't ever hide yourself.</font>

99
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:10,519
<font color="yellow">Da Hee, I'm going out. Your meal is
in front of the door. Eat it!</font>

100
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,776
<font color="yellow">Didn't you learn about,
"What goes around comes around"?</font>

101
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,187
<font color="yellow">Isn't it natural for them to be punished
since they did wrong?</font>

102
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:20,761
<font color="yellow">Why do you always say to hold back
and be patient?</font>

103
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,446
<font color="yellow">Reflect on yourself instead of taking
revenge. Think about what you did wrong!</font>

104
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:27,855
<font color="yellow">Why reflect when he did nothing wrong?
You should reflect on yourself!</font>

105
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:32,240
<font color="yellow">Another man just like him! If you have
time for this, take care of your wife!</font>

106
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,105
<font color="yellow">Your husband doesn't even
look at you at night, right?</font>

107
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:38,023
<font color="yellow">That's why you're taking it out here!</font>

108
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:41,153
<font color="yellow">If I were your wife, I couldn't live
with you even for a moment!</font>

109
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you?</font>

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,530
<font color="yellow">Would you come if you knew where I was?</font>

111
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,028
<font color="yellow">Sure, I'll go! I'll go!</font>

112
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:52,154
<font color="yellow">Hello, Yoon Woo's mom.
This is Joon Soo's mom.</font>

113
00:08:53,745 --> 00:09:01,426
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering if Joon Soo could
enter the art class that Yoon Woo is in.</font>

114
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,827
<font color="yellow">I think registration
for the class is over.</font>

115
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,634
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

116
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:10,046
<font color="yellow">It's only four kids per class. So moms
registered together for the class.</font>

117
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,673
<font color="yellow">Why? Does Joon Soo want to go, too?</font>

118
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,265
<font color="yellow">Is there any way?</font>

119
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,910
<font color="yellow">I hear the owner is an acquaintance
of Seo Ra's mom...</font>

120
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,734
<font color="yellow">If you came out often and became friends
with Seo Ra's mom, it'd be easier.</font>

121
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:27,051
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

122
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:29,400
<font color="yellow">I'll try asking Seo Ra's mom.</font>

123
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,870
<font color="yellow">It may not work,
so don't get your hopes up.</font>

124
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,203
<font color="yellow">Thank you! Yes, thank you!</font>

125
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:41,815
<font color="yellow">The director is looking for you.</font>

126
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,614
<font color="yellow">How is it going
with the J Motors Project?</font>

127
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:51,514
<font color="yellow">It's going well.</font>

128
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:58,722
<font color="yellow">Team Leader Jung, you have a kid...</font>

129
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:03,860
<font color="yellow">I'm wondering if it's too burdensome
for you to carry such a big project.</font>

130
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:08,308
<font color="yellow">- I'm fine.
- Actually...</font>

131
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:12,995
<font color="yellow">J Motors asked me to change the one
in charge of the project.</font>

132
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,416
<font color="yellow">I know you've worked hard on it so far.</font>

133
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:27,032
<font color="yellow">It's hard to ignore
a big client's request of us.</font>

134
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:30,392
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

135
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:35,898
<font color="yellow">Manager Ji said that the big frames
of the project have been all set.</font>

136
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:39,321
<font color="yellow">He said it would be okay
to give the rest to the staff.</font>

137
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,702
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yes, I will.</font>

138
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:49,419
<font color="yellow">Okay. Make sure to hand over the rest.</font>

139
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:52,263
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

140
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,326
<font color="yellow">There is no evidence, but you think
your wife is cheating on you?</font>

141
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:31,601
<font color="yellow">Yes. I definitely think
she's seeing someone.</font>

142
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,297
<font color="yellow">But there is nothing.</font>

143
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:36,086
<font color="yellow">My wife's phone is under my name</font>

144
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:41,297
<font color="yellow">so I retrieved the call record and
text messages, but they're clean.</font>

145
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:45,750
<font color="yellow">Did she erase all of them
knowing that I'd look at them?</font>

146
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,937
<font color="yellow">Even recently--</font>

147
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:50,366
<font color="yellow">Isn't he delusional?</font>

148
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:53,081
<font color="yellow">She must've done something.
He wouldn't be delusional for no reason.</font>

149
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,934
<font color="yellow">There is no evidence
that she did anything to deserve it.</font>

150
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:59,301
<font color="yellow">Exactly! The client admits it himself.</font>

151
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,933
<font color="yellow">There is no cellphone
under the wife's name.</font>

152
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,567
<font color="yellow">There is no home phone.</font>

153
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,461
<font color="yellow">The wife doesn't know how to use a
computer, so she can't even send email.</font>

154
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:09,960
<font color="yellow">Would she tie her message on a pigeon's
leg to communicate with a man?</font>

155
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,732
<font color="yellow">Making impossible things possible is
what's exciting about an affair.</font>

156
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,504
<font color="yellow">It's like narcotics.</font>

157
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:15,197
<font color="yellow">What's so exciting about it?</font>

158
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:17,798
<font color="yellow">If you think about the husband's
situation, how can you say that?</font>

159
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:21,573
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense
and just wrap up the whole plan.</font>

160
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:24,298
<font color="yellow">For the main plot,
why don't we go with the feel</font>

161
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:27,022
<font color="yellow">of the real situation
like we did yesterday?</font>

162
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:31,302
<font color="yellow">Why don't we start with an interview
of dangerous wives as an intro?</font>

163
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:34,148
<font color="yellow">Also to show what's going on these days.</font>

164
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,977
<font color="yellow">The thinking of the women these days
has definitely changed a lot.</font>

165
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:40,832
<font color="yellow">Even if you find women like that,
would it be easy to interview them?</font>

166
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:42,751
<font color="yellow">I learned from the rookie that there are</font>

167
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,671
<font color="yellow">a lot of apps that help with affairs.</font>

168
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,568
<font color="yellow">- We'll use those.
- Hey, most are free for women.</font>

169
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,913
<font color="yellow">You mean, men have to pay? Why?</font>

170
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:54,985
<font color="yellow">It's unfair! At least they should manage
the quality of women then. Right?</font>

171
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,904
<font color="yellow">What a classy comment.
Producer Ahn, what's your date of birth?</font>

172
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,376
<font color="yellow">May 8, '83.</font>

173
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:03,004
<font color="yellow">Wait, are you using mine?
Don't do it!</font>

174
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:04,366
<font color="yellow">Do it with his.</font>

175
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,505
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

176
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,312
<font color="yellow">So that we can do research!</font>

177
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:09,383
<font color="yellow">For him to join the group, his age...</font>

178
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,469
<font color="yellow">Of course you'd be very popular.</font>

179
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:16,168
<font color="yellow">It'll be better to have a man who looks
more familiar and has a more real feel.</font>

180
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,514
<font color="yellow">- Producer Do.
- What?</font>

181
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:23,890
<font color="yellow">Kimchi!</font>

182
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,293
<font color="yellow">Kimchi.</font>

183
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,827
<font color="yellow">[Congratulations on Joining!
Mr. Do Hyun Woo]</font>

184
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:39,331
<font color="yellow">- Brother-in-law.
- Yes.</font>

185
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:40,407
<font color="yellow">You must be going somewhere.</font>

186
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:44,260
<font color="yellow">Because of the program, they keep
asking me to come and go.</font>

187
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,299
<font color="yellow">They seem to rely on me too much.</font>

188
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,410
<font color="yellow">Someone's supposed to be coming today.</font>

189
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:51,466
<font color="yellow">- Who?
- Ah Ra.</font>

190
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,739
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

191
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,528
<font color="yellow">She said she'd register for flower
arrangement class near here.</font>

192
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,527
<font color="yellow">- Flower arrangement class?
- Yes.</font>

193
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:01,788
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- To go there on weekends.</font>

194
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:03,854
<font color="yellow">Since you're also
going to work on weekends</font>

195
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:05,919
<font color="yellow">she thought it'd be good
to go home together.</font>

196
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:12,148
<font color="yellow">- She could come to this office, too.
- Of course! Since it's so close!</font>

197
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:15,971
<font color="yellow">You said you were going out
for the program.</font>

198
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,048
<font color="yellow">It's not good that they're
relying on me too much.</font>

199
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:20,125
<font color="yellow">I'm going to show them some tough love.</font>

200
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,187
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

201
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:29,294
<font color="yellow">Wow, I have a feeling.</font>

202
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:34,952
<font color="yellow">She's using the flower arrangements as
an excuse to keep an eye on me.</font>

203
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:38,678
<font color="yellow">I'm someone who can be locked in.</font>

204
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:44,900
<font color="yellow">There is no joy.</font>

205
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:53,100
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I didn't know I had a visitor.</font>

206
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,985
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat here.</font>

207
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:01,192
<font color="yellow">Everyone who comes here
for the first time feels that way.</font>

208
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,383
<font color="yellow">They've had a lot of thoughts,
and been hesitant...</font>

209
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:06,663
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Please come this way.</font>

210
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:11,937
<font color="yellow">You're very cold.</font>

211
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,869
<font color="yellow">You're really cold.
Do you have poor circulation?</font>

212
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:23,336
<font color="yellow">Can it be this cold?</font>

213
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:33,836
<font color="yellow">By the way, the aura is...</font>

214
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:35,979
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

215
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,232
<font color="yellow">How...</font>

216
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:46,657
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty.</font>

217
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:54,390
<font color="yellow">What the hell was that?</font>

218
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,826
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen a woman for too long
and now I'm getting withdrawal symptoms.</font>

219
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:03,082
<font color="yellow">How could I flirt with a ghost?</font>

220
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:23,950
<font color="yellow">I'm the leader of this program.
Should I sacrifice myself and go there?</font>

221
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,580
<font color="yellow">They told me I was too young.</font>

222
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,857
<font color="yellow">If you'll do this once,
we'll plan the rest better.</font>

223
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:32,903
<font color="yellow">Oh, the woman who requested
the meeting is young.</font>

224
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:34,918
<font color="yellow">Wow, she's also pretty.</font>

225
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:39,131
<font color="yellow">You should just have an affair, too.</font>

226
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,863
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

227
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,208
<font color="yellow">- Hey, don't you need to test this?
- Yes, we'll test it.</font>

228
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:49,105
<font color="yellow">- Does it work?
- Yes.</font>

229
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,464
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

230
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,092
<font color="yellow">Producer Do looks good
with glasses, right?</font>

231
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:56,222
<font color="yellow">Ha! He looks like ----</font>

232
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

233
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:13,193
<font color="yellow">Honey, here!</font>

234
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:22,097
<font color="yellow">You look just like the picture.</font>

235
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,343
<font color="yellow">Your picture is a little...</font>

236
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:28,567
<font color="yellow">That's when I was young. I was pretty
when I was young, wasn't I?</font>

237
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,641
<font color="yellow">If you look closely,
I still have that face.</font>

238
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:34,263
<font color="yellow">Come here. Here!</font>

239
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,961
<font color="yellow">Come here. I can't hear very well.</font>

240
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:48,571
<font color="yellow">By the way, is it okay
to be in such a bright place?</font>

241
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:51,173
<font color="yellow">It's hard to see,
so why would we meet at a dark place?</font>

242
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:54,945
<font color="yellow">Besides, have we done anything wrong?
Am I wrong?</font>

243
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:57,151
<font color="yellow">What will you do
if you get caught by your husband?</font>

244
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,140
<font color="yellow">If you're worried about that,
you can't have an affair.</font>

245
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,523
<font color="yellow">And who knows? My husband may be meeting
with another woman somewhere.</font>

246
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,078
<font color="yellow">You must meet people often this way.</font>

247
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:14,165
<font color="yellow">At first, I was curious
and wanted to talk.</font>

248
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,461
<font color="yellow">Your family doesn't know
that you're doing this?</font>

249
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,359
<font color="yellow">How would they know?</font>

250
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,056
<font color="yellow">What about you?
Isn't it the same for you as well?</font>

251
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:25,701
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Who knows?</font>

252
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,053
<font color="yellow">I heard there are cases
where people go out unknowingly #</font>

253
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,403
<font color="yellow">and end up saying, "Oh, Honey!"</font>

254
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:32,170
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, my butt...</font>

255
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,404
<font color="yellow">I know you like it.</font>

256
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,638
<font color="yellow">We don't need to be pretentious.</font>

257
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,789
<font color="yellow">Wow, you must work out.</font>

258
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,365
<font color="yellow">Your butt is firm.</font>

259
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:42,905
<font color="yellow">- Seriously!
- Should we get on with it?</font>

260
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,162
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

261
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:45,726
<font color="yellow">Evacuate! Evacuate!</font>

262
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,579
<font color="yellow">Is that your name, Evacuate?</font>

263
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:52,622
<font color="yellow">Hey, hurry up and evacuate!</font>

264
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:54,738
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

265
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:59,325
<font color="yellow">I've seen your flower arrangements
at home.</font>

266
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:02,028
<font color="yellow">Aren't you already at a professional
level without taking lessons?</font>

267
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:07,544
<font color="yellow">I only have a few little tricks.
I'd like to learn properly.</font>

268
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:10,559
<font color="yellow">The teacher here is famous
in the flower art world.</font>

269
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,311
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to come so far...</font>

270
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:16,739
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

271
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,317
<font color="yellow">You don't object
to whatever I want to learn.</font>

272
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:21,365
<font color="yellow">But you're against flower arrangement.</font>

273
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:23,086
<font color="yellow">Do you have any other reason for it?</font>

274
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:25,260
<font color="yellow">- It's suffocating.
- Excuse me?</font>

275
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:31,476
<font color="yellow">Recently, I've become allergic
to flower pollen...</font>

276
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:40,490
<font color="yellow">Since you like flowers, I didn't tell
you because I didn't want to upset you.</font>

277
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,634
<font color="yellow">My coughing...</font>

278
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:46,564
<font color="yellow">- Should we go to the hospital?
- No no no.</font>

279
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:50,539
<font color="yellow">No no. It's not that. I think it'll
be okay if I stay far away.</font>

280
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,766
<font color="yellow">Mrs. Eun Ah Ra?</font>

281
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,088
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- I'm the instructor, Moon Sun Hee.</font>

282
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,894
<font color="yellow">I'm Eun Ah Ra.</font>

283
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:08,924
<font color="yellow">Have you taken flower arrangement
lessons before?</font>

284
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:24,683
<font color="yellow">Is that a trap or a reward?</font>

285
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:34,083
<font color="yellow">In the net that my wife cast,
there is a mermaid.</font>

286
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:41,169
<font color="yellow">Since I've already been caught,
I should relax and stay in.</font>

287
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:46,365
<font color="yellow">You must be working out.
Your butt is so firm.</font>

288
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,154
<font color="yellow">Evacuate! Evacuate, evacuate!</font>

289
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:52,084
<font color="yellow">Is that your name, Evacuate?</font>

290
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:57,448
<font color="yellow">You idiots, I said evacuate!</font>

291
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:58,674
<font color="yellow">Turn it off.</font>

292
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:03,108
<font color="yellow">We can't use this, can we?</font>

293
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:04,827
<font color="yellow">We should cut out
the beginning and use it.</font>

294
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:09,304
<font color="yellow">You went there for work, so you should
stay calm and work...</font>

295
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:14,616
<font color="yellow">That lady is awful,
touching your butt and all.</font>

296
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:18,795
<font color="yellow">Now you have the video,
so you can ask her and air it, right?</font>

297
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,237
<font color="yellow">I'm heading out.</font>

298
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:24,167
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

299
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,641
<font color="yellow">The last client and this client as well.</font>

300
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:31,029
<font color="yellow">The wives had affairs, but the husbands
look pitiful and small.</font>

301
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,762
<font color="yellow">Let's not blame the husband
on our show.</font>

302
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:37,734
<font color="yellow">Those women didn't have affairs
because of their husbands.</font>

303
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:40,078
<font color="yellow">They just like the fact that the men
they're with are not their husbands.</font>

304
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:43,666
<font color="yellow">Let's not make the innocent husbands
sinners, okay?</font>

305
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,625
<font color="yellow">I'm really leaving now.</font>

306
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,855
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for your work.
- Bye now.</font>

307
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:52,767
<font color="yellow">But... I like this video
because it's so raw.</font>

308
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:58,112
<font color="yellow">Let's do this one more time.
I'll do it this time.</font>

309
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,036
<font color="yellow">- Will you be okay?
- What do you mean?</font>

310
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:01,699
<font color="yellow">Doesn't your wife get upset?</font>

311
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,352
<font color="yellow">Why would she be upset? It's work!</font>

312
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:07,165
<font color="yellow">You didn't say anything
when Hyun Woo did it.</font>

313
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:09,980
<font color="yellow">So why do you say this
when I'm about to do it?</font>

314
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,586
<font color="yellow">You should at least call her
and ask her.</font>

315
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:18,536
<font color="yellow">Forget it. If it's necessary, I'll look
her in the eye and talk to her directly.</font>

316
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:21,098
<font color="yellow">Why would I tell her on the phone...
Hey, you!</font>

317
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:23,534
<font color="yellow">Make sure to pick the right woman!</font>

318
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:27,096
<font color="yellow">If someone like that last one comes,
you'll be in big trouble!</font>

319
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,920
<font color="yellow">What is this, a blind date?</font>

320
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,875
<font color="yellow">A blind date is something
you did yesterday, Writer Kwon.</font>

321
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:54,744
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

322
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:59,853
<font color="yellow">I'm the husband of Eun Ah Ra
who registered this morning.</font>

323
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:02,407
<font color="yellow">I see. What brings you here?</font>

324
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:06,076
<font color="yellow">I'd like to learn flower arrangement.</font>

325
00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:08,698
<font color="yellow">- For yourself?
- Yes.</font>

326
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:11,079
<font color="yellow">To be honest...</font>

327
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,832
<font color="yellow">My wife's birthday
is coming up in a few days.</font>

328
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:16,347
<font color="yellow">She loves flowers so much.</font>

329
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:21,355
<font color="yellow">I think she'll like it
if I give her something I made.</font>

330
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,500
<font color="yellow">You're very kind.</font>

331
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,307
<font color="yellow">Oh, by the way, you can't tell my wife.</font>

332
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:29,380
<font color="yellow">It's a surprise.</font>

333
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,747
<font color="yellow">Oh wait. Mrs. Eun Ah Ra said you are
allergic to flower pollen.</font>

334
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,253
<font color="yellow">- I'm find around pretty flowers.
- Pardon?</font>

335
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:40,152
<font color="yellow">I mean, I have to overcome it with love.</font>

336
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,121
<font color="yellow">You're admirable.</font>

337
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,630
<font color="yellow">That's too much.</font>

338
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,415
<font color="yellow">You're working really late.</font>

339
00:23:47,415 --> 00:23:49,810
<font color="yellow">Your husband must be waiting for you.
Aren't you going home?</font>

340
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,983
<font color="yellow">I'm divorced.</font>

341
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:57,433
<font color="yellow">Oh, divorced...
I'm glad you bounced back.</font>

342
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:59,963
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me?
- It's nothing.</font>

343
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:03,671
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you for lessons.
- Yes, have a good night.</font>

344
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,171
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

345
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,980
<font color="yellow">Hello! You must be heading home.</font>

346
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:25,971
<font color="yellow">You have a sticker on.
Did you not register the car?</font>

347
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:29,113
<font color="yellow">What? It's been fine until now.</font>

348
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:31,551
<font color="yellow">I'm glad I happened to pass by.</font>

349
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,366
<font color="yellow">Hold on a minute.</font>

350
00:24:37,124 --> 00:24:39,200
<font color="yellow">Sorry to make you wait.</font>

351
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,662
<font color="yellow">Pour hot water like this.</font>

352
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:47,287
<font color="yellow">Goodness, it's really clean.</font>

353
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:49,473
<font color="yellow">How can I thank you for this?</font>

354
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:53,618
<font color="yellow">You're welcome. I will register the car
for you. This won't happen again.</font>

355
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:57,241
<font color="yellow">- Well, then.
- Okay, thank you.</font>

356
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,115
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

357
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:02,532
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

358
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:06,336
<font color="yellow">I made your favorite gochujang stew.
Let's eat!</font>

359
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:10,924
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious! Hurry up!</font>

360
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,334
<font color="yellow">I must be losing it.
It hasn't been that long.</font>

361
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:51,711
<font color="yellow">Mom, do I get to go
to the art academy now?</font>

362
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:57,804
<font color="yellow">I'm looking into it.</font>

363
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:03,700
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, why do you want
to go to the art class?</font>

364
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,699
<font color="yellow">I just like it.</font>

365
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,518
<font color="yellow">If you don't get to go
to the art class...</font>

366
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:18,507
<font color="yellow">Never mind.
I will make sure to get you in.</font>

367
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:25,442
<font color="yellow">Mom, if it's too hard for you,
I don't need to go to the art class.</font>

368
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,935
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

369
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:30,988
<font color="yellow">Dad told me not to make things
difficult for you.</font>

370
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:35,448
<font color="yellow">- Dad said that?
- Yes, he did.</font>

371
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:38,949
<font color="yellow">He said that I'd be in trouble
if I make things difficult for you.</font>

372
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:43,416
<font color="yellow">He said that he and I
have to protect you.</font>

373
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,088
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

374
00:27:58,088 --> 00:28:00,356
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Are you asleep?</font>

375
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:01,877
<font color="yellow">No, Mother.</font>

376
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,349
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have a cup of tea?</font>

377
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:09,061
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

378
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:14,300
<font color="yellow">I thought about taking some side dishes
and soup to your place.</font>

379
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,419
<font color="yellow">But I wanted him to starve a little,
so I didn't.</font>

380
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,316
<font color="yellow">Even if you live with him again</font>

381
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:21,856
<font color="yellow">it doesn't become something
that didn't happen.</font>

382
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:24,945
<font color="yellow">It won't be covered even if you
try to cover it.</font>

383
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:27,102
<font color="yellow">In the end, it's what you decide.</font>

384
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:30,638
<font color="yellow">What life you decide to live...</font>

385
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,046
<font color="yellow">I should just watch a movie.</font>

386
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:48,779
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

387
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,315
<font color="yellow">Manager! Happy birthday to you!</font>

388
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:07,152
<font color="yellow">Wow, she's making me an idiot
to the very end.</font>

389
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:13,183
<font color="yellow">Until the very end!</font>

390
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,998
<font color="yellow">Eun Jeong, are you sure
you picked the right woman?</font>

391
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:27,539
<font color="yellow">I looked her up with her ID.
She looks the same as this picture.</font>

392
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:31,795
<font color="yellow">Wow, why does she go around doing that
with this face?</font>

393
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:35,064
<font color="yellow">Be careful not to drop this mic.</font>

394
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,795
<font color="yellow">Am I an amateur?</font>

395
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:42,215
<font color="yellow">Hey, the glasses...
Can we get better frames?</font>

396
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,616
<font color="yellow">I don't think we can
use much of Producer Do's</font>

397
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,586
<font color="yellow">so you have to do well today.</font>

398
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,839
<font color="yellow">I'm a good-looking man close up, right?</font>

399
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,393
<font color="yellow">Yes, you look just like
one of those guys.</font>

400
00:29:56,393 --> 00:29:59,707
<font color="yellow">Mi Ha. What do you think?</font>

401
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:02,917
<font color="yellow">----</font>

402
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,198
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

403
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:09,896
<font color="yellow">When did it start?</font>

404
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:11,420
<font color="yellow">Six months ago.</font>

405
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,175
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with him?
I'm asking if you slept with him!</font>

406
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:15,556
<font color="yellow">Yes, I slept with him.</font>

407
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:20,615
<font color="yellow">I missed him. I've wanted
to see him the whole time.</font>

408
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:23,021
<font color="yellow">So I asked him to see me first.</font>

409
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:52,496
<font color="yellow">Really...</font>

410
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,835
<font color="yellow">Hello, is this the locksmith?</font>

411
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:59,349
<font color="yellow">I'm calling from
the flower arrangement place.</font>

412
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:01,755
<font color="yellow">I'm calling you because
the key pad doesn't work.</font>

413
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:06,904
<font color="yellow">It's been taken care of. Yes, yes.</font>

414
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:10,340
<font color="yellow">Sorry, "It's been taken care of"?
The key pad is not working.</font>

415
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,007
<font color="yellow">It's been taken care of.</font>

416
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:14,689
<font color="yellow">Usually...</font>

417
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:17,289
<font color="yellow">this happens a lot
when the battery is out.</font>

418
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:21,027
<font color="yellow">For a quick trick. Now press it.</font>

419
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:26,180
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

420
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,461
<font color="yellow">It works fine, right?</font>

421
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:31,051
<font color="yellow">If you buy the battery,
I'll change it for you later.</font>

422
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:34,277
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You've helped me again.</font>

423
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:36,259
<font color="yellow">If you're really thankful, later--</font>

424
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:39,328
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will give you
a delicious cup of tea.</font>

425
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:41,292
<font color="yellow">Forget the tea.</font>

426
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:44,892
<font color="yellow">I'll just ask for extra attention for
my flower arrangement lesson later.</font>

427
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:46,275
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

428
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:01,224
<font color="yellow">Let's hit him. I'll hit him.</font>

429
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:03,285
<font color="yellow">Hit him. Hit him.</font>

430
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:05,477
<font color="yellow">Let's hit him. Hit him, Do Hyun Woo.</font>

431
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:21,405
<font color="yellow">It would've been better
if you led it to the end.</font>

432
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:25,554
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm getting credit for the
work that's already been done.</font>

433
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:29,932
<font color="yellow">Not at all.
I'd feel better if you'd do it.</font>

434
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:32,759
<font color="yellow">I'll wrap it up
and hand it over to you today.</font>

435
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:36,363
<font color="yellow">I'll also go to J Motors
and tell them about the handover.</font>

436
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:43,119
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo's Mom, I spoke to the owner,
and Joon Soo's in!</font>

437
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,838
<font color="yellow">I knew it! Seo Ra's mom is the best!</font>

438
00:33:44,838 --> 00:33:48,096
<font color="yellow">It looks like Joon Soo's mom should treat
Seo Ra's mom! LOL.</font>

439
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,140
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

440
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:59,278
<font color="yellow">Of course I should. Thank you!
I asked for a difficult favor.</font>

441
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:01,940
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.
Also, I don't think it's necessary</font>

442
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,602
<font color="yellow">to pick up the kids for all of us.</font>

443
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:05,938
<font color="yellow">Would it be better to take turns
and pick them up?</font>

444
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:09,101
<font color="yellow">How would we decide the order?
That sounds like work, too.</font>

445
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:17,197
<font color="yellow">True. It's tough to think about
picking up the kids without a car.</font>

446
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:26,362
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

447
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:29,275
<font color="yellow">Is that okay?
Joon Soo's Mom, do you have a car?</font>

448
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,048
<font color="yellow">I can borrow a company car.</font>

449
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:42,565
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

450
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,744
<font color="yellow">Is it going well?</font>

451
00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:57,284
<font color="yellow">I was going to make a gift for my wife
without any help...</font>

452
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:59,519
<font color="yellow">It's a bit odd.
It looks like nothing, doesn't it?</font>

453
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,860
<font color="yellow">It looks good.</font>

454
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,583
<font color="yellow">I really hope that my wife
also thinks that way.</font>

455
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,856
<font color="yellow">Your wife must be happy.</font>

456
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:12,929
<font color="yellow">You must love your wife a lot.</font>

457
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:14,260
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

458
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:20,804
<font color="yellow">My wife is... like a gift in my life.</font>

459
00:35:20,804 --> 00:35:24,539
<font color="yellow">In my life, I've never
had butterflies in my stomach</font>

460
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,273
<font color="yellow">for another woman but my wife.</font>

461
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:31,893
<font color="yellow">I'm an idiot.</font>

462
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:35,302
<font color="yellow">I look like an idiot, don't I?</font>

463
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,809
<font color="yellow">Ouch!</font>

464
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,898
<font color="yellow">Let me see!</font>

465
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:43,947
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

466
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:55,177
<font color="yellow">Do you know what kind of men
women are most attracted to?</font>

467
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:02,233
<font color="yellow">I should get going now.
It's late.</font>

468
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:03,936
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

469
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,382
<font color="yellow">It's a man that can be stolen away.</font>

470
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:12,001
<font color="yellow">One, two, three!</font>

471
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,445
<font color="yellow">Don't fall for her. Ask her!</font>

472
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,523
<font color="yellow">- I got it.
- Excuse me?</font>

473
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,983
<font color="yellow">I knew that you'd be beautiful.</font>

474
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:45,389
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see. Thank you.</font>

475
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:49,938
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

476
00:36:51,384 --> 00:36:52,465
<font color="yellow">Since I started meeting people this way</font>

477
00:36:52,465 --> 00:36:56,557
<font color="yellow">I think it's the first time I hear
a comment like, "You're beautiful."</font>

478
00:36:57,677 --> 00:37:02,259
<font color="yellow">Then what kind of comments do you hear?</font>

479
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:07,898
<font color="yellow">It's direct. Since the goal is clear...</font>

480
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:10,846
<font color="yellow">"Let's go to a hotel." Or sometimes</font>

481
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:13,793
<font color="yellow">we talk about each
other's family as if it's no big deal.</font>

482
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,096
<font color="yellow">It must be your first time, since
you're asking lots of questions.</font>

483
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:21,686
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

484
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:25,418
<font color="yellow">There aren't too many people
who come out here</font>

485
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:27,079
<font color="yellow">because they have a problem
in their marriage.</font>

486
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,811
<font color="yellow">Aren't you the same way?
Do you have an issue with your wife?</font>

487
00:37:38,108 --> 00:37:39,536
<font color="yellow">Say something.</font>

488
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:43,606
<font color="yellow">My wife ran away.</font>

489
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:47,472
<font color="yellow">Three days after we came back
from our honeymoon.</font>

490
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:50,315
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, you went too far.</font>

491
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,320
<font color="yellow">If she was going to leave
after three days</font>

492
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,324
<font color="yellow">she'd have broken it off
before the wedding!</font>

493
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:56,862
<font color="yellow">What is Producer Ahn thinking?</font>

494
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,387
<font color="yellow">Team Leader, please check the website.
I loaded the design for the shopping bag.</font>

495
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:04,708
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

496
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,445
<font color="yellow">- Ye Rim.
- Yes, Team Leader.</font>

497
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:11,936
<font color="yellow">The design is a bit different.
We decided not to highlight the BI.</font>

498
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:16,121
<font color="yellow">Didn't we decide to go with a robotype
rather than than the watermark?</font>

499
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,257
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry. I'll fix it.</font>

500
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:22,501
<font color="yellow">What about you, Eun Ok?
What's going on with you?</font>

501
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,862
<font color="yellow">I uploaded it.</font>

502
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:29,373
<font color="yellow">Eun Ok, there is nothing that's developed
from the idea sketch.</font>

503
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,376
<font color="yellow">It should've been refined
following the plan!</font>

504
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,139
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Upload it again after refining it.</font>

505
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,681
<font color="yellow">Team Leader.</font>

506
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:49,177
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

507
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,882
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I got upset earlier.</font>

508
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:57,336
<font color="yellow">I think I've been a bit sensitive
with the handover these days.</font>

509
00:38:57,336 --> 00:39:00,188
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
It happened because I was rushing.</font>

510
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:04,034
<font color="yellow">I thought I had to get a confirmation
from you before you left work.</font>

511
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:08,105
<font color="yellow">Once you leave for home, I have to get
the updates from you over the phone.</font>

512
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:10,592
<font color="yellow">But there is a limit to what
you can do over the phone.</font>

513
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,916
<font color="yellow">I'll do better!</font>

514
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:50,778
<font color="yellow">Oh, Honey.</font>

515
00:39:50,778 --> 00:39:52,643
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

516
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:55,253
<font color="yellow">I had tea with the flower arrangement
members and stopped by.</font>

517
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:58,139
<font color="yellow">By the way, did Do Yeon go somewhere?</font>

518
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:01,987
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.
She must've gone to Hyun Woo's office.</font>

519
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:05,532
<font color="yellow">It looks like she likes the assistant
producer at Hyun Woo's office.</font>

520
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:06,860
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

521
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,690
<font color="yellow">She didn't mention anything like that.</font>

522
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:14,050
<font color="yellow">Did you change your cologne?</font>

523
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,320
<font color="yellow">I use the same old cologne.</font>

524
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,103
<font color="yellow">You do? But...</font>

525
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:22,300
<font color="yellow">It smells like roses.</font>

526
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:30,117
<font color="yellow">I had a client earlier
who had a rose perfume on.</font>

527
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,672
<font color="yellow">Is that the smell?</font>

528
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:35,157
<font color="yellow">Let's go out and eat! Let's go!</font>

529
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:36,286
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

530
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:39,329
<font color="yellow">My stomach feels full. I'm sorry.</font>

531
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:40,670
<font color="yellow">No need to be sorry.</font>

532
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,322
<font color="yellow">Are you heading home?</font>

533
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:44,275
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stop by at the flower
arrangement place.</font>

534
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,137
<font color="yellow">I have something to discuss
with the teacher.</font>

535
00:40:54,842 --> 00:40:56,583
<font color="yellow">Bye. Be careful going home.</font>

536
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,295
<font color="yellow">She's like a ghost.</font>

537
00:41:08,295 --> 00:41:10,980
<font color="yellow">You'd like to register
for additional classes?</font>

538
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,853
<font color="yellow">I registered for the weekend class</font>

539
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,726
<font color="yellow">but I want to register
for the weekday classes, too.</font>

540
00:41:14,726 --> 00:41:18,610
<font color="yellow">I already thought you were more skilled
than the other members.</font>

541
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,965
<font color="yellow">Please wait. I'll bring the papers.</font>

542
00:42:29,157 --> 00:42:36,228
<font color="yellow">I came to tell you that Han Young Joo
will lead the project from now on.</font>

543
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:41,282
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

544
00:42:43,726 --> 00:42:48,713
<font color="yellow">It would've been better
if you told me ahead of time.</font>

545
00:42:51,061 --> 00:42:54,391
<font color="yellow">I thought it would be right
to go through the company.</font>

546
00:42:55,813 --> 00:43:01,927
<font color="yellow">I thought it would be better...
not to contact you personally.</font>

547
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,634
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

548
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:15,552
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it through.</font>

549
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:22,025
<font color="yellow">Your husband came to see me at work.</font>

550
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:28,936
<font color="yellow">He seems like a good guy.</font>

551
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,403
<font color="yellow">I regret that this project
turned out this way.</font>

552
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:41,494
<font color="yellow">But I thought it wouldn't be good
for each other and for the project.</font>

553
00:43:52,164 --> 00:43:53,594
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

554
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:56,028
<font color="yellow">Since I started meeting people this way</font>

555
00:43:56,028 --> 00:44:00,043
<font color="yellow">I think this is the first time hearing
a comment like, "You're beautiful."</font>

556
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:05,181
<font color="yellow">Oh, then what kind of comments...</font>

557
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:13,684
<font color="yellow">It's direct. The goal is clear.</font>

558
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:17,739
<font color="yellow">I was really good
at making her talk, wasn't I?</font>

559
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:23,371
<font color="yellow">It's as if we cast her for the role.
She speaks well, detailed and eloquent.</font>

560
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:24,818
<font color="yellow">You did well.</font>

561
00:44:24,818 --> 00:44:27,536
<font color="yellow">Your far-out story
earned a pity point, for sure.</font>

562
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:28,949
<font color="yellow">My story?</font>

563
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,876
<font color="yellow">The scenario that your wife
left three days after your honeymoon.</font>

564
00:44:33,943 --> 00:44:36,132
<font color="yellow">Did I go too far with that? Why?</font>

565
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,967
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it sound like it could happen?</font>

566
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:41,731
<font color="yellow">For the wife to run away three days
after the honeymoon...</font>

567
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:44,840
<font color="yellow">the man must've known that her heart
had left before that.</font>

568
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,083
<font color="yellow">But they were pushed to get married
and even went on a honeymoon?</font>

569
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:50,990
<font color="yellow">Either the man is an idiot</font>

570
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,248
<font color="yellow">or he loved his wife a lot.</font>

571
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:57,422
<font color="yellow">She must've believed you
because you said it with that face.</font>

572
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:03,012
<font color="yellow">Why? It's because I look
like a romantic guy?</font>

573
00:45:03,012 --> 00:45:05,079
<font color="yellow">How is that possible? You're an idiot.</font>

574
00:45:13,746 --> 00:45:16,302
<font color="yellow">Producer Do has some issue, right?</font>

575
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:18,958
<font color="yellow">What issue?</font>

576
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,800
<font color="yellow">Something like maybe
his wife is having an affair...</font>

577
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:28,342
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?
That's not true.</font>

578
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:33,108
<font color="yellow">Producer Ahn, do you know your pinky
opens up when you lie?</font>

579
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:38,440
<font color="yellow">Do I really do that?</font>

580
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,780
<font color="yellow">So I'm right about the affair.</font>

581
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,826
<font color="yellow">See? You're an idiot.</font>

582
00:45:44,277 --> 00:45:48,829
<font color="yellow">Don't let him know. If he found out that
you knew, he wouldn't come to work.</font>

00:45:50,134 --> 00:45:52,103
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Where?</font>

584
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:55,440
<font color="yellow">- Let's just go.
- Where?</font>

585
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,650
<font color="yellow">Let's go out and talk.
Just come out when I tell you to!</font>

586
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,313
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

587
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:01,666
<font color="yellow">What about Joon Soo?</font>

588
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:04,445
<font color="yellow">Mother said she'd take him today.</font>

589
00:46:08,036 --> 00:46:14,331
<font color="yellow">I... went to his office today.</font>

590
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:17,465
<font color="yellow">It was really fancy.</font>

591
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:19,061
<font color="yellow">I heard.</font>

592
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:20,826
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

593
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:27,280
<font color="yellow">So you already heard it from him?</font>

594
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:30,034
<font color="yellow">You must be still getting along.</font>

595
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:31,567
<font color="yellow">I saw him because of work.</font>

596
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,655
<font color="yellow">You're still working with him
after that ruckus?</font>

597
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:35,715
<font color="yellow">Are you even considering
ending it with him?</font>

598
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:39,291
<font color="yellow">It's already over, and I have no reason
to see him anymore.</font>

599
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,309
<font color="yellow">Of course you shouldn't see him!</font>

600
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:42,989
<font color="yellow">If you still see him, how can you call
yourself a human being?</font>

601
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:44,501
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

602
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:48,068
<font color="yellow">Can we solve our problem between us?</font>

603
00:46:49,378 --> 00:46:51,059
<font color="yellow">It's "us" only in cases like this.</font>

604
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,655
<font color="yellow">Did you care about me
when you had an affair with him?</font>

605
00:46:57,454 --> 00:46:59,164
<font color="yellow">He's walking around smiling!</font>

606
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:01,112
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you
that he's walking around smiling.</font>

607
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:05,646
<font color="yellow">He gets hellos from security guards and
walks around with a coffee, all relaxed.</font>

608
00:47:05,646 --> 00:47:07,974
<font color="yellow">I've been torn to pieces,
but nothing changed for him!</font>

609
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:10,302
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to happen only to me?</font>

610
00:47:10,302 --> 00:47:12,257
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

611
00:47:13,695 --> 00:47:15,523
<font color="yellow">You did whatever you wanted.</font>

612
00:47:15,523 --> 00:47:18,077
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever I want.</font>

613
00:47:18,077 --> 00:47:20,320
<font color="yellow">So don't tell me what to do.
Do you understand?</font>

614
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:34,552
<font color="yellow">[Michael Lee

<font color="yellow">He's a real psychopath!</font>

623
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:17,807
<font color="yellow">For a guy who loves his kids this much...</font>

<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

626
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,130
<font color="yellow">Is that his wife?</font>

627
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,079
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous, Manager.</font>

628
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,733
<font color="yellow">You're my role model.</font>

629
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:30,958
<font color="yellow">This crazy bastard!</font>

630
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,184
<font color="yellow">I was curious.</font>

631
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:55,753
<font color="yellow">About his surroundings, his car</font>

632
00:48:55,753 --> 00:48:59,322
<font color="yellow">his house that have not
been affected by this ruckus.</font>

633
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:01,525
<font color="yellow">And his wife.</font>

634
00:49:09,657 --> 00:49:11,608
<font color="yellow">You came home really early today.</font>

635
00:49:11,608 --> 00:49:12,876
<font color="yellow">I'm early because I missed you!</font>

636
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:15,775
<font color="yellow">I was hoping that his wife would
have the same expression I do.</font>

637
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,295
<font color="yellow">- What did you do?
- I cooked a lot of things you like!</font>

638
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:20,327
<font color="yellow">Really? I should eat a lot.</font>

639
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:24,621
<font color="yellow">I want to take everything away from him,
and make him miserable.</font>

640
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:28,414
<font color="yellow">Just like me.
No, a hundred times worse than me.</font>

641
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:38,777
<font color="yellow">I don't love you. There is no reason--</font>

642
00:49:38,777 --> 00:49:44,873
<font color="yellow">Oh, you left me.</font>

643
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:50,121
<font color="yellow">I'm all alone, I'm all alone.</font>

644
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,981
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

645
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,882
<font color="yellow">Really!</font>

646
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:26,980
<font color="yellow">I really couldn't stand it.</font>

647
00:50:27,976 --> 00:50:30,451
<font color="yellow">I was so angry, so I came to see you.</font>

648
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:34,331
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

649
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:38,646
<font color="yellow">Let me check one thing.</font>

650
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:45,402
<font color="yellow">Is it true that you started
seeing her six months ago?</font>

651
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,358
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

652
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:50,797
<font color="yellow">How far...</font>

653
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:55,211
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't mean where...</font>

654
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:58,507
<font color="yellow">Once. That's all there was.</font>

655
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,789
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry"?</font>

656
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:07,672
<font color="yellow">Is it all okay if you say, "I'm sorry,"
you son of a bitch?</font>

657
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:14,088
<font color="yellow">You two are the ones who did wrong,
so why do I have to suffer so much?</font>

658
00:51:14,088 --> 00:51:16,775
<font color="yellow">And why are you so relaxed?
What did you do right?</font>

659
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:20,072
<font color="yellow">Have I gone mad?
Am I the only ---- here?</font>

660
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:23,858
<font color="yellow">And what about your wife?</font>

661
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,434
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell your wife?</font>

662
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:31,050
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault. Soo Yeon was--</font>

663
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,047
<font color="yellow">"Soo Yeon"? "Soo Yeon"?</font>

664
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:35,047
<font color="yellow">We tried to protect the family. I also--</font>

665
00:51:35,047 --> 00:51:37,168
<font color="yellow">But it's been broken!</font>

666
00:51:37,168 --> 00:51:39,210
<font color="yellow">In your eyes, is this protection?</font>

667
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:55,737
<font color="yellow">Call her.</font>

668
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:00,288
<font color="yellow">Call your wife
who is blissfully ignorant.</font>

669
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:06,550
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to act logical right now.</font>

670
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,585
<font color="yellow">If you don't want me to go wake up your
kids in bed and make a scene, call her!</font>

671
00:52:43,498 --> 00:52:45,778
<font color="yellow">Honey, it's me.</font>

672
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:51,157
<font color="yellow">This is...
No, it's not mine.</font>

673
00:52:52,695 --> 00:52:53,934
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

674
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:56,273
<font color="yellow">This is Do Hyun Woo.</font>

675
00:52:57,528 --> 00:53:03,219
<font color="yellow">Your husband had an affair with my wife.</font>

676
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:07,445
<font color="yellow">You should hear the rest
directly from your husband.</font>

677
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:11,277
<font color="yellow">Tell her. Tell her!</font>

678
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,760
<font color="yellow">Honey, it's me.</font>

679
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:24,157
<font color="yellow">What he said is true.</font>

680
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:28,663
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

681
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:39,445
<font color="yellow">Everyone, I finally got my revenge.</font>

682
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:43,550
<font color="yellow">I beat up that bastard who had an affair
and told his wife everything.</font>

683
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,125
<font color="yellow">I felt relieved.</font>

684
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,327
<font color="yellow">- What a relief!
- Refreshing!</font>

685
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:49,574
<font color="yellow">I feel like my indigestion
has been cured.</font>

686
00:53:49,574 --> 00:53:53,094
<font color="yellow">I want to send Toycrane 1,000 balloons.</font>

687
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,521
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

688
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:04,465
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

689
00:54:05,672 --> 00:54:06,831
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

690
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:13,565
<font color="yellow">Is this a "smaphone"?</font>

691
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,583
<font color="yellow">- Oh, you mean, smartphone?
- Yes, smaphone.</font>

692
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:20,105
<font color="yellow">Go into the stock gallery.</font>

693
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:21,592
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

694
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:29,885
<font color="yellow">The big sisters here have something
to look at for a minute.</font>

695
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,894
<font color="yellow">I'm in.</font>

696
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:40,724
<font color="yellow">It's up! It's up!</font>

697
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:42,367
<font color="yellow">What does it say?</font>

698
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:45,152
<font color="yellow">- He hit the man who had an affair!
- What else?</font>

699
00:54:45,152 --> 00:54:47,130
<font color="yellow">And he told his wife!</font>

700
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,130
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

701
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:53,583
<font color="yellow">I thought he was a fool,
but he did what he had to do!</font>

702
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:56,007
<font color="yellow">Give it back now!</font>

703
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:59,751
<font color="yellow">How much does this thing cost?</font>

704
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:04,373
<font color="yellow">If it's not a good one, it'll be about
200,000 or 300,000 won.</font>

705
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:07,273
<font color="yellow">Thank you, young man.</font>

706
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:15,365
<font color="yellow">If we had one, we'd find out everything
without going to the post office.</font>

707
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:18,019
<font color="yellow">Where do we have money to buy that?</font>

708
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:19,652
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside!</font>

709
00:55:21,244 --> 00:55:23,351
<font color="yellow">You've caused big trouble.</font>

710
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:26,460
<font color="yellow">Your wife won't just ignore it.</font>

711
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,099
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

712
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,266
<font color="yellow">Hi. Have you been doing well?</font>

713
00:55:59,266 --> 00:56:02,018
<font color="yellow">Well... so so.</font>

714
00:56:02,018 --> 00:56:03,577
<font color="yellow">"So so"?</font>

715
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,532
<font color="yellow">Don't you miss me?</font>

716
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:08,510
<font color="yellow">Of course I miss you.</font>

717
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:13,768
<font color="yellow">Don't you miss Mom, Dad?</font>

718
00:56:14,813 --> 00:56:15,978
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

719
00:56:21,114 --> 00:56:22,630
<font color="yellow">Go to bed.</font>

720
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,197
<font color="yellow">Mom, it's Dad!</font>

721
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:28,222
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, you should go to the bathroom
and go to bed now!</font>

722
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:31,940
<font color="yellow">Dad, good night! I'm going to the
bathroom then to bed.</font>

723
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:36,221
<font color="yellow">Okay. Sure.</font>

724
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:38,728
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

725
00:56:57,043 --> 00:57:01,878
<font color="yellow">Sister-in-law, can you go to Hyun Woo's
office and bring me the script?</font>

726
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:03,112
<font color="yellow">No, I can't.</font>

727
00:57:03,112 --> 00:57:04,927
<font color="yellow">You can't?</font>

728
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:09,094
<font color="yellow">I believe Producer Lee is alone.
You should go hear about the show...</font>

729
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:17,128
<font color="yellow">We will arrange flowers in an Asian style
using the needle point holder.</font>

730
00:57:17,128 --> 00:57:20,831
<font color="yellow">Put the first main one about 15 to 20
degrees slanted from the center.</font>

731
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:31,074
<font color="yellow">Then proceed with your flower arrangement
as I instructed.</font>

732
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,369
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

733
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:36,177
<font color="yellow">Honey, you came.</font>

734
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,173
<font color="yellow">Weren't you supposed to be doing
flower arrangement now?</font>

735
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:43,713
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

736
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,751
<font color="yellow">You must've missed me so you came here!</font>

737
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:52,579
<font color="yellow">Now I saw you, so I'll leave.</font>

738
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:56,978
<font color="yellow">All right.
Come any time you want to see me.</font>

739
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:19,416
<font color="yellow">It's been a while
since you worked outside.</font>

740
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,985
<font color="yellow">Working outside these days means--</font>

741
00:59:21,985 --> 00:59:25,085
<font color="yellow">I worked outside a lot
until 10 years ago.</font>

742
00:59:25,085 --> 00:59:30,181
<font color="yellow">"A lot"? You didn't even make manager.
You got laid off and stayed at home.</font>

743
00:59:30,181 --> 00:59:35,827
<font color="yellow">Yes, I stayed at home and cooked for you.
I did a lot to take care of you.</font>

744
00:59:35,827 --> 00:59:37,748
<font color="yellow">Cut!</font>

745
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:39,463
<font color="yellow">Is this the reward for working
so hard at home?</font>

746
00:59:39,463 --> 00:59:42,021
<font color="yellow">To see my wife having an affair?</font>

747
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:45,574
<font color="yellow">How can you say I had an affair?</font>

748
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:47,369
<font color="yellow">You're seeing another man
behind my back--</font>

749
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:51,172
<font color="yellow">I tried to convince the client,
but he wants the blurry screen.</font>

750
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:56,972
<font color="yellow">Of course he would.
It's nothing to brag about.</font>

751
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,125
<font color="yellow">- It's really exactly what you said.
- What do you mean?</font>

752
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:07,195
<font color="yellow">The wife is definitely the aggressor
and the husband is the victim.</font>

753
01:00:07,195 --> 01:00:09,791
<font color="yellow">But he looks more intimidated somehow.</font>

754
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:17,226
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, there really aren't
any clear aggressor or victim.</font>

755
01:00:17,226 --> 01:00:19,393
<font color="yellow">You know, "gross negligence."</font>

756
01:00:19,393 --> 01:00:22,994
<font color="yellow">They know that the marriage would be
put to danger at this rate.</font>

757
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,815
<font color="yellow">But they don't make an effort.
There are a lot of couples like that.</font>

758
01:00:24,815 --> 01:00:27,849
<font color="yellow">Hey hey, add that interview.</font>

759
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:28,981
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

760
01:00:28,981 --> 01:00:31,806
<font color="yellow">Gross negligence...</font>

761
01:00:42,853 --> 01:00:46,831
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to do this
when I found someone I love.</font>

762
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,134
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

763
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:53,201
<font color="yellow">For giving me the opportunity.</font>

764
01:00:55,896 --> 01:00:58,447
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

765
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,980
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

766
01:01:20,371 --> 01:01:22,271
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

767
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:26,028
<font color="yellow">Good job.
Was there any request for adjustments?</font>

768
01:01:26,028 --> 01:01:27,163
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

769
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:29,079
<font color="yellow">You haven't had lunch yet, have you?</font>

770
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:32,652
<font color="yellow">Manager Ji Sun Woo bought me lunch,
so I ate.</font>

771
01:01:32,652 --> 01:01:37,056
<font color="yellow">That must be nice.
Manager Ji is such a good-looking guy.</font>

772
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:51,025
<font color="yellow">By the way,
Manager Ji had a cut on his face.</font>

773
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:55,072
<font color="yellow">He said he fell after having a drink,
but it looked like he got beat up.</font>

774
01:01:55,072 --> 01:01:56,204
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

775
01:01:58,193 --> 01:02:02,639
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, there isn't any
clear aggressor or a victim.</font>

776
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,873
<font color="yellow">You know, "gross negligence"?</font>

777
01:02:04,873 --> 01:02:08,396
<font color="yellow">They know that the marriage would be
put in danger at this rate.</font>

778
01:02:08,396 --> 01:02:10,853
<font color="yellow">But they don't make an effort.
There are a lot of couples like that.</font>

779
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:13,719
<font color="yellow">What kind of effort do I need to make?</font>

780
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:16,420
<font color="yellow">And why do I have to be the only one
making an effort?</font>

781
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:56,378
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo's at Mother's house.</font>

782
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:10,565
<font color="yellow">Did you see him?</font>

783
01:03:13,514 --> 01:03:15,784
<font color="yellow">What did you do to him?</font>

784
01:03:15,784 --> 01:03:18,025
<font color="yellow">You seem to know everything,
so why do you ask?</font>

785
01:03:20,257 --> 01:03:21,788
<font color="yellow">Did you really do that?</font>

786
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,239
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. Why?</font>

787
01:03:26,978 --> 01:03:30,773
<font color="yellow">Why? Did he come to you and tell on me?</font>

788
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:35,586
<font color="yellow">So what? Did you console him?</font>

789
01:03:35,586 --> 01:03:38,711
<font color="yellow">I found out about it by chance.</font>

790
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:45,432
<font color="yellow">Honey...
Let's not make this a bigger issue.</font>

791
01:03:45,432 --> 01:03:47,302
<font color="yellow">It's our problem.</font>

792
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:49,858
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have known
without that incident!</font>

793
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:52,074
<font color="yellow">You two made this happen! It's you two!</font>

794
01:03:52,074 --> 01:03:54,367
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

795
01:03:55,413 --> 01:03:58,025
<font color="yellow">I guess you only heard
that he got beat up.</font>

796
01:03:59,632 --> 01:04:01,744
<font color="yellow">I also told his wife about it.</font>

797
01:04:01,744 --> 01:04:03,179
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

798
01:04:04,242 --> 01:04:05,552
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

799
01:04:05,552 --> 01:04:07,847
<font color="yellow">Honey, that's separate
from our problem--</font>

800
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:09,266
<font color="yellow">How is that separate?</font>

801
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:12,135
<font color="yellow">You and her husband had an affair.</font>

802
01:04:12,135 --> 01:04:15,967
<font color="yellow">I'm mad at you, I'm mad at that bastard.</font>

803
01:04:15,967 --> 01:04:20,153
<font color="yellow">I'm even mad at the bastard's wife
who didn't know anything.</font>

804
01:04:24,755 --> 01:04:27,010
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

805
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:30,728
<font color="yellow">This is how I am now, so am I supposed
to consider their situation?</font>

806
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,478
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she's thankful now.</font>

807
01:04:35,478 --> 01:04:37,445
<font color="yellow">Without me, she wouldn't have known
for the rest of her life</font>

808
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:39,411
<font color="yellow">how her husband cheated on her.</font>

809
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:48,452
<font color="yellow">So... do you feel relieved?</font>

810
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:50,351
<font color="yellow">Yes, I feel relieved! Why?</font>

811
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:58,443
<font color="yellow">Okay. I understand
that it's tough on you.</font>

812
01:04:59,974 --> 01:05:01,590
<font color="yellow">This is really...</font>

813
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:08,264
<font color="yellow">Hey. If you feel that bad for him...</font>

814
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:11,045
<font color="yellow">Take this to him and comfort him.</font>

815
01:05:13,181 --> 01:05:16,806
<font color="yellow">You bought it
for his birthday anyway, right?</font>

816
01:05:16,806 --> 01:05:18,869
<font color="yellow">Who knows?</font>

817
01:05:18,869 --> 01:05:21,231
<font color="yellow">Both families are broken up now.</font>

818
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:24,617
<font color="yellow">So he might ask you to run away
and live with him.</font>

819
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:30,480
<font color="yellow">Why? You don't have courage to run away
and live with him somewhere else?</font>

820
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,545
<font color="yellow">You don't have such courage but
you slept with that bastard?</font>

821
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:46,577
<font color="yellow">I didn't buy this to give it to him.</font>

822
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,389
<font color="yellow">It's a gift for you.</font>

823
01:05:51,757 --> 01:05:54,827
<font color="yellow">A gift? A gift for me?</font>

824
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,985
<font color="yellow">A woman who spent
our wedding anniversary</font>

825
01:05:58,985 --> 01:06:01,088
<font color="yellow">as if nothing happened
bought a gift for me?</font>

826
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:02,938
<font color="yellow">You expect me to believe that?</font>

827
01:06:02,938 --> 01:06:06,297
<font color="yellow">Just how far
are you going to deceive me?</font>

828
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:11,976
<font color="yellow">Please! Stop pretending to be a victim!</font>

829
01:06:11,976 --> 01:06:14,692
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who got destroyed.</font>

830
01:06:14,692 --> 01:06:17,224
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who feels like he's dying!</font>

831
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,835
<font color="yellow">I'm the victim, you're the aggressor!</font>

832
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,681
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am the aggressor.</font>

833
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:28,894
<font color="yellow">Hey, if I really lose it,
I don't know what I'll do.</font>

834
01:06:28,894 --> 01:06:31,434
<font color="yellow">I'll go to his office
and tell everyone everything!</font>

835
01:06:39,255 --> 01:06:41,416
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave Mother's house.</font>

836
01:06:42,501 --> 01:06:44,567
<font color="yellow">I'll tell Mother everything.</font>

837
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:48,592
<font color="yellow">Every time I face her, it's hell.</font>

838
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:52,710
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

839
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,623
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey!</font>

840
01:06:54,623 --> 01:06:56,168
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

841
01:06:58,762 --> 01:07:00,119
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

842
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:01,862
<font color="yellow">You're going to tell Mom?</font>

843
01:07:01,862 --> 01:07:04,327
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see my mom faint?</font>

844
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:07,561
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what kind
of life she's led?</font>

845
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:12,103
<font color="yellow">Tuna Mayo, you were right.</font>

846
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:17,088
<font color="yellow">My wife is acting like she's blaming me.</font>

847
01:07:17,088 --> 01:07:18,820
<font color="yellow">I'm going crazy.</font>

848
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,592
<font color="yellow">This week...</font>

849
01:07:25,592 --> 01:07:27,952
<font color="yellow">[D H W]</font>

850
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:30,641
<font color="yellow">My wife's counterattack started.</font>

851
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:47,210
<font color="yellow">bioskopkeren.ORG</font>

852
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,974
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to do this? Where are
you going? Do you have any place to go?</font>

853
01:07:55,974 --> 01:07:57,532
<font color="yellow">I'll leave.</font>

854
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:59,661
<font color="yellow">You were going to separate,
but why would you leave home?</font>

855
01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:02,644
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Producer Ahn's wife?
She works here?</font>

856
01:08:02,644 --> 01:08:05,429
<font color="yellow">My wife has short hair.
Her hair grew long.</font>

857
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:07,688
<font color="yellow">Wake up, okay?</font>

858
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:12,286
<font color="yellow">You didn't sleep with her or touch her</font>

859
01:08:12,286 --> 01:08:14,335
<font color="yellow">but isn't that a step before
having an affair?</font>

860
01:08:14,335 --> 01:08:19,300
<font color="yellow">Mrs. Jung Soo Yeon? I was curious
about the woman my husband was seeing.</font>

861
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,927
<font color="yellow">I'd like to talk to my wife
one more time tonight.</font>

862
01:08:21,927 --> 01:08:24,484
<font color="yellow">I'm going to ask her honestly
about why she did it.</font>

863
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:26,586
<font color="yellow">Why would you leave home?</font>

864
01:08:26,586 --> 01:08:28,394
<font color="yellow">It's not him.</font>

865
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,582
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother.</font>
