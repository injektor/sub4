00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,400
<font color="yellow">Does anyone know how we can find out
their hotel room number?</font>

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,520
<font color="yellow">This is so exciting.</font>

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,240
<font color="yellow">Did they meet?
Ask him if they are together.</font>

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,600
<font color="yellow">I guess you are Lord Ahn.</font>

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,040
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if you could check</font>

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,920
<font color="yellow">how things are going and let us know
as soon as possible.</font>

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,760
<font color="yellow">She will say she cheated on him
because of the husband.</font>

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,520
<font color="yellow">- That's what they all say.
- If the man was a good guy</font>

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
<font color="yellow">why would the wife cheat on him?</font>

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,200
<font color="yellow">You must be deeply hurt.</font>

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,200
<font color="yellow">I can feel your pain.</font>

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,640
<font color="yellow">I will leave first.</font>

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,720
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,280
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,120
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,520
<font color="yellow">Work.</font>

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,440
<font color="yellow">I came to check our filming site.</font>

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,360
<font color="yellow">Huh? Look at this bastard.</font>

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,160
<font color="yellow">We are going to the lounge.
What floor are you going to?</font>

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,240
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can fool me?</font>

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,920
<font color="yellow">If you guys are going to the lounge,
why do you have a room key?</font>

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,200
<font color="yellow">- Are you Jung Soo Yeon's husband?
- That's right.</font>

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,160
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.
I'm Ji Sun Woo from J Motors.</font>

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,040
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the room and talk.</font>

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,160
<font color="yellow">Let's be calm and cold.</font>

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,200
<font color="yellow">Show him and your wife that you
love her way more than him.</font>

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,520
<font color="yellow">That's right. Whoever that guys is</font>

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,640
<font color="yellow">I have no reason to lose to him.</font>

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,160
<font color="yellow">Get proof. No matter what happens later,
get all the proof you can get.</font>

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,280
<font color="yellow">Smile.</font>

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,160
<font color="yellow">Let's talk over here. Here.</font>

37
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,920
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

38
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
<font color="yellow">To be honest...</font>

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,760
<font color="yellow">I hoped that this wouldn't happen.</font>

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,280
<font color="yellow">I saw the text you sent.</font>

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,720
<font color="yellow">"I reserved a room without your
permission. I miss you."</font>

42
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,840
<font color="yellow">At first, I thought it could be spam
or voice phishing.</font>

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,360
<font color="yellow">I hoped that was the case.</font>

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,040
<font color="yellow">Until this day that you guys
waited in excitement....</font>

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,800
<font color="yellow">Every day I... I tried to talk with her.</font>

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,840
<font color="yellow">But I missed my chances.</font>

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,840
<font color="yellow">Everything is ruined now.</font>

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,480
<font color="yellow">- It's all our fault.
- "Our fault?"</font>

49
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,120
<font color="yellow">"Our..."</font>

50
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,400
<font color="yellow">Did you say you are Ji Sun Woo?</font>

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,760
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,600
<font color="yellow">Are you married?</font>

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,640
<font color="yellow">- I have a wife.
- You have a wife, you bastard.</font>

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,480
<font color="yellow">Does you wife know
what you have been doing?</font>

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,400
<font color="yellow">No, she doesn't know.</font>

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,840
<font color="yellow">What were you planning on doing?</font>

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,720
<font color="yellow">To take it this far...</font>

58
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,040
<font color="yellow">You must have had a plan.</font>

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, so you didn't want to
take it to the end.</font>

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,760
<font color="yellow">So you are like playing with fire.
Just for fun?</font>

61
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
<font color="yellow">Right? Both of you.
You guys are playing with fire.</font>

62
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung Soo Yeon. Your ring...</font>

63
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
<font color="yellow">You don't actually love him, right?</font>

64
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,400
<font color="yellow">- I'm...
- We are playing with fire.</font>

65
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,280
<font color="yellow">We didn't intend to ruin
each other's family.</font>

66
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,160
<font color="yellow">On that same note, I think we are just
playing with fire. Just for fun.</font>

67
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,440
<font color="yellow">Even though it is an
"inappropriate relationship"</font>

68
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
<font color="yellow">I love her.</font>

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,880
<font color="yellow">Of course, I feel sorry to
you and my family.</font>

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure Soo Yeon will feel the same--
- Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon!</font>

71
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,760
<font color="yellow">Who said you can say
my wife's name like that?</font>

72
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

73
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,840
<font color="yellow">Hey, what about you?</font>

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,080
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything to say?</font>

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

76
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,840
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

77
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,360
<font color="yellow">- What can I say to you?
- Who said I want to hear how you feel?</font>

78
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,800
<font color="yellow">Don't you have something to tell me?</font>

79
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,080
<font color="yellow">Oh my. What are you guys?</font>

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,720
<font color="yellow">Why are you guys so calm and cool?</font>

81
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,480
<font color="yellow">You guys just got caught cheating.</font>

82
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,440
<font color="yellow">You guys are supposed
to kneel down and beg for mercy!</font>

83
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,400
<font color="yellow">Aren't you supposed to say "I'm sorry,
forgive me" or something like that?</font>

84
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,880
<font color="yellow">Do you mean there's no need to do that?</font>

85
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,520
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's get divorced.
Let's get divorced.</font>

86
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,680
<font color="yellow">We can just get divorced.</font>

87
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,320
<font color="yellow">Don't ever think about coming back.</font>

88
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you so cool? You are so cool.</font>

89
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,160
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you guys want to do!</font>

90
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,120
<font color="yellow">Kwon Bo Young. You punched a person.</font>

91
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,800
<font color="yellow">You don't seem like you are
self-reflecting at all.</font>

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,600
<font color="yellow">Look here. This is also a memory.
We have to take a picture.</font>

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,560
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

94
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,600
<font color="yellow">Okay, go ahead and make fun of me.
You don't get many chances like this.</font>

95
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,760
<font color="yellow">What did she say?</font>

96
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
<font color="yellow">She won't let it go that easily.</font>

97
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,280
<font color="yellow">You totally ruined her.</font>

98
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,120
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn to punch like that?</font>

99
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,160
<font color="yellow">I saw you make her head spin!</font>

100
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,680
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

101
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,440
<font color="yellow">I'm not kidding. Her head spun back.</font>

102
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
<font color="yellow">I was too surprised. I made eye contract
with her and so I said "hello."</font>

103
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,920
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

104
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,040
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

105
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,360
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

106
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
<font color="yellow">Is the client okay?</font>

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,800
<font color="yellow">How could he be okay?
He saw all that with his eyes.</font>

108
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,000
<font color="yellow">The filming site must have been a mess.</font>

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
<font color="yellow">I should have held back.</font>

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,520
<font color="yellow">But she was bringing the child
into the mess and being nasty.</font>

111
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,760
<font color="yellow">A mom shouldn't do that.</font>

112
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,640
<font color="yellow">You did well. Even I felt better.</font>

113
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,360
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

114
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,040
<font color="yellow">It's Yoon Ki.</font>

115
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,560
<font color="yellow">Hey, Yoon Ki.</font>

116
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,640
<font color="yellow">How much longer
does she have to stay here?</font>

117
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
<font color="yellow">For a case like this,
they will let her out soon.</font>

118
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,320
<font color="yellow">- I met with the victim.
- You will be out soon.</font>

119
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
<font color="yellow">She can get out if her guardian comes.
Tell her not to worry.</font>

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,800
<font color="yellow">I'm going to see Hyun Woo.</font>

121
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,000
<font color="yellow">I will be there soon too.</font>

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
<font color="yellow">He said your guardian has to come here.</font>

123
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
<font color="yellow">Who should I call?
I will call him or her for you.</font>

124
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
<font color="yellow">- Guardian?
- Should I call your parents?</font>

125
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,560
<font color="yellow">Oh, they passed away.</font>

126
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,160
<font color="yellow">Who should I call?</font>

127
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,000
<font color="yellow">Kwon Bo Young, is your guardian here?</font>

128
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,440
<font color="yellow">Here. I'm Kwon Bo Young's guardian.</font>

129
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
<font color="yellow">Why is Producer Ahn my guardian?</font>

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
<font color="yellow">- There's no one else.
- I don't want you to be my guardian.</font>

131
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
<font color="yellow">- Are you going to stay there?
- Yes, I'm going to stay here.</font>

132
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- I know you are going to ask me</font>

133
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
<font color="yellow">to do all sorts of things for you.</font>

134
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm here.</font>

135
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,880
<font color="yellow">Never. You can't do that.
I don't want it.</font>

136
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You went though a lot.</font>

137
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,920
<font color="yellow">- Eat it.
- No.</font>

138
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,640
<font color="yellow">Eat it. I heard if you eat this,
you won't come back here ever again.</font>

139
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,240
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

140
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,640
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo. How did it go?</font>

141
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,080
<font color="yellow">Is she here? Did you see Soo Yeon?</font>

142
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,840
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Hey, did you hit him?</font>

143
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,800
<font color="yellow">You didn't kill him, right?</font>

144
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,000
<font color="yellow">Oh. Door. Bam.</font>

145
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,240
<font color="yellow">Okay. You did well. You hit the door.
You hit the door well.</font>

146
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,640
<font color="yellow">Did you talk with them?
What did you say?</font>

147
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,760
<font color="yellow">I said we should get divorced.</font>

148
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,880
<font color="yellow">I told them to do whatever they
want to do. And I walked out.</font>

149
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,480
<font color="yellow">So there are only two of
them in the room.</font>

150
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,720
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- "Yes?"</font>

151
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,480
<font color="yellow">What do you mean yes? Are you crazy?
What can they be doing now?</font>

152
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,320
<font color="yellow">What if they are really
consoling each other?</font>

153
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,600
<font color="yellow">I thought she would follow me.
If I said "let's get divorced"</font>

154
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,560
<font color="yellow">I thought she would follow me out
and beg me.</font>

155
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,080
<font color="yellow">But she stayed there.</font>

156
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,520
<font color="yellow">Just leave them alone.</font>

157
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,360
<font color="yellow">You thought she would follow you out?</font>

158
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,560
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any idea
what I should've said.</font>

159
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
<font color="yellow">I'm don't even know
what I actually said.</font>

160
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
<font color="yellow">I was the only one
who got all worked up and upset.</font>

161
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,680
<font color="yellow">I couldn't do anything.
I just walked out.</font>

162
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,120
<font color="yellow">What about that bastard?</font>

163
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,840
<font color="yellow">He looked confident.</font>

164
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,800
<font color="yellow">- He said it was just for fun.
- What?</font>

165
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
<font color="yellow">He said everything he wanted to say.</font>

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,800
<font color="yellow">He has a better job.</font>

167
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,920
<font color="yellow">He will earn more than me.
His house will be nicer than mine.</font>

168
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,120
<font color="yellow">His car will be nicer than mine.</font>

169
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,080
<font color="yellow">- No wonder she fell for him.
- Yoon Ki.</font>

170
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,520
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

171
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,400
<font color="yellow">What about proof?
Did you take pictures?</font>

172
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

173
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,240
<font color="yellow">I took pictures.</font>

174
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,040
<font color="yellow">Wow, look at this. He's handsome.</font>

175
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,800
<font color="yellow">He looked nice. He has a family too.</font>

176
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,240
<font color="yellow">This can be used as proof, right?
Proof that she cheated on him.</font>

177
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,160
<font color="yellow">We can use this as proof.</font>

178
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,320
<font color="yellow">But if you want alimony, or to sue her</font>

179
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
<font color="yellow">- we need clear information.
- Information?</font>

180
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,840
<font color="yellow">Something like how long they have been
dating each other?</font>

181
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,000
<font color="yellow">How often did they see each other?
You asked them about that, right?</font>

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
<font color="yellow">- No, I couldn't ask her.
- What?</font>

183
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,920
<font color="yellow">Did you not ask if that
was the first time or not?</font>

184
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,400
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Gosh, you.</font>

185
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,040
<font color="yellow">Then what did you do there?</font>

186
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,280
<font color="yellow">Before seeing them together I thought</font>

187
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,840
<font color="yellow">I should say this if she says this,
and I should say that if she says that.</font>

188
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,920
<font color="yellow">I thought if I get divorced,
I should live like this with Joon Soo.</font>

189
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,520
<font color="yellow">The day I send Joon Soo off to the army,
I should do this.</font>

190
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,240
<font color="yellow">I should do this on the day of
Joon Soo's wedding.</font>

191
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,320
<font color="yellow">I thought about all those things.</font>

192
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
<font color="yellow">I should do this if she
asks me to forgive her.</font>

193
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
<font color="yellow">I should do this if she wants to stay
away for a while.</font>

194
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,280
<font color="yellow">I thought about that too.</font>

195
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,080
<font color="yellow">But now,
I have no idea what I should do.</font>

196
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,920
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you it's going to be okay.</font>

197
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,000
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you it will get better.</font>

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,400
<font color="yellow">Just end it here.</font>

199
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,440
<font color="yellow">I've seen many cases like this.</font>

200
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,880
<font color="yellow">Just end it here and enjoy your life.</font>

201
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,600
<font color="yellow">Meet someone younger
and prettier than her.</font>

202
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,520
<font color="yellow">And enjoy your life.</font>

203
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,320
<font color="yellow">You just came out of hell.</font>

204
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, no. Don't divorce her.
Don't do her that favor.</font>

205
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,440
<font color="yellow">You are only making her happy.</font>

206
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,400
<font color="yellow">Keep her by your side and get payback.</font>

207
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,120
<font color="yellow">What do you mean keep her by his side?
She won't be there.</font>

208
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,880
<font color="yellow">If he's in misery, she can't be happy.</font>

209
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,760
<font color="yellow">You guys promised each other
on your wedding day.</font>

210
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
<font color="yellow">Whether it's good or bad, happy or sad,
you guys promised to stay together.</font>

211
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,280
<font color="yellow">You should be responsible for that
promise you made.</font>

212
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,920
<font color="yellow">You're like an old man.</font>

213
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,200
<font color="yellow">I will get enough alimony
from her and that guy.</font>

214
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
<font color="yellow">So show them how you enjoy your life.</font>

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,160
<font color="yellow">That's how you should get your revenge.</font>

216
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,720
<font color="yellow">Now, everything is over.</font>

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,080
<font color="yellow">I have nothing left in me.
I'm not sure what I should do.</font>

218
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,280
<font color="yellow">I wanted to thank you guys first.</font>

219
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,560
<font color="yellow">In the hotel room today, my wife,
me, and that guy...</font>

220
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,320
<font color="yellow">The three of us talked.</font>

221
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,240
<font color="yellow">If my wife begged me and told me
she didn't want to get divorced</font>

222
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,680
<font color="yellow">I was going to forgive everything
and come back home with her.</font>

223
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,840
<font color="yellow">She didn't even flinch.
She was calm and cold.</font>

224
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,800
<font color="yellow">She said it's all her fault.</font>

225
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,840
<font color="yellow">And I thought I should
just end it there.</font>

226
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,920
<font color="yellow">My wife was my life, and I loved her.</font>

227
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,160
<font color="yellow">But to her</font>

228
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,280
<font color="yellow">I guess our relationship was not
something she wanted to hold onto.</font>

229
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,040
<font color="yellow">Now, divorce is
our only solution, right?</font>

230
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,760
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

231
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,600
<font color="yellow">I have to stay here for a few days.</font>

232
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,520
<font color="yellow">Did you argue with Dad again?</font>

233
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,040
<font color="yellow">What about Soo Yeon?</font>

234
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,800
<font color="yellow">She's still at work?</font>

235
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,760
<font color="yellow">- What about our Joon Soo?
- Joon Soo?</font>

236
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,560
<font color="yellow">That's right. Joon Soo.</font>

237
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,360
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon was going to pick him up.</font>

238
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,920
<font color="yellow">Mom, I will be back soon.</font>

239
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,600
<font color="yellow">- Hello, I'm sorry. I'm too late.
- Hello.</font>

240
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,840
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon took him a moment ago.</font>

241
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,520
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You guys didn't talk to each other?</font>

242
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,400
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

243
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,720
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Okay.
- Okay, bye.</font>

244
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,240
<font color="yellow">Where did she go with him?</font>

245
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,040
<font color="yellow">She's driving me crazy.</font>

246
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,000
<font color="yellow">Why is she not answering her phone?</font>

247
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,400
<font color="yellow">How could she take the kid? Geez.</font>

248
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,160
<font color="yellow">Where are you? What are you doing?</font>

249
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,320
<font color="yellow">How could you take Joon Soo?</font>

250
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,840
<font color="yellow">His mom took her child.
Why are you yelling?</font>

251
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,080
<font color="yellow">Mom, why do you have her phone?</font>

252
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,800
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon and Joon Soo are here.
Hurry and come home.</font>

253
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,480
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

254
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,600
<font color="yellow">- Joon Soo, did you have fun today?
- Dad.</font>

255
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,800
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

256
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,200
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

257
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,360
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

258
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,640
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come home.</font>

259
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,680
<font color="yellow">I thought we should talk.</font>

260
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,680
<font color="yellow">What's there for us to talk about
in this kind of situation?</font>

261
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I didn't know Mom was here.</font>

262
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,240
<font color="yellow">I will somehow send Mom home.</font>

263
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,760
<font color="yellow">Leave as soon as Mom leaves.</font>

264
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,280
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- You didn't eat dinner yet, right?</font>

265
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,920
<font color="yellow">I know you're busy with work
but don't make your husband skip meals.</font>

266
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,480
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

267
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,040
<font color="yellow">Don't stand there. Get the soup ready.</font>

268
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

269
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,920
<font color="yellow">This is so good.</font>

270
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,840
<font color="yellow">Right? Eat a lot, my puppy.</font>

271
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,360
<font color="yellow">Are you busy these days?</font>

272
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,840
<font color="yellow">Yes. A bit...</font>

273
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,200
<font color="yellow">I know you don't have to
go grocery shopping.</font>

274
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
<font color="yellow">But don't buy too much rice.</font>

275
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,840
<font color="yellow">I think it has been there for too long.
It doesn't taste that good.</font>

276
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,000
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will do that.</font>

277
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,880
<font color="yellow">When I go back home, I will send you
some rice. Put aside the ones you have.</font>

278
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,720
<font color="yellow">Let's make rice cakes with that rice.</font>

279
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother.</font>

280
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,680
<font color="yellow">Where is Soo Yeon?</font>

281
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,320
<font color="yellow">She's giving Joon Soo a bath.</font>

282
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,240
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

283
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but can't you go home today?</font>

284
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,760
<font color="yellow">She cheated on you, right?</font>

285
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,520
<font color="yellow">Huh? Who said that?</font>

286
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,440
<font color="yellow">You thought I wouldn't notice?
Am I right?</font>

287
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,720
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

288
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
<font color="yellow">- Why did you hit me?
- You.</font>

289
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,200
<font color="yellow">You saw me going though all that trouble
because of your dad.</font>

290
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,360
<font color="yellow">How could you even think
about having an affair?</font>

291
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

292
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,760
<font color="yellow">This is so upsetting. You are so lame.</font>

293
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,880
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

294
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,200
<font color="yellow">You would know
if you ever took care of your family.</font>

295
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,120
<font color="yellow">Just by looking at the kitchen and stuff</font>

296
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,600
<font color="yellow">you can tell how much the wife
cares about the house and the family.</font>

297
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,200
<font color="yellow">She's working and raising a child.</font>

298
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,800
<font color="yellow">I can see that she is doing her best
to make everything work.</font>

299
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,200
<font color="yellow">- Mom, that's not it.
- Look how thin she is.</font>

300
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,920
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel bad for her?</font>

301
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
<font color="yellow">I said that's not it.</font>

302
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

303
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,480
<font color="yellow">If you cheat, you will be the one
who will be left alone.</font>

304
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,880
<font color="yellow">You are in your 40's.
If you get divorce now</font>

305
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,600
<font color="yellow">who do you think is going
to take care of you?</font>

306
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,840
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen anyone live well
after leaving his wife.</font>

307
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,320
<font color="yellow">Why me...</font>

308
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,480
<font color="yellow">I'm a weirdo too. Why am I
watching this if it's that scary?</font>

309
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,080
<font color="yellow">But I want to watch it.</font>

310
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
<font color="yellow">I want to watch it, but I will close it.</font>

311
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,480
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

312
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,440
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that rascal.</font>

313
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,320
<font color="yellow">He's drunk.</font>

314
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,040
<font color="yellow">Wake up!</font>

315
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,200
<font color="yellow">If you are drunk, go to your house.
Why are you here?</font>

316
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,800
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

317
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,160
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon.</font>

318
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,760
<font color="yellow">I came to check if Writer Kwon
is doing well.</font>

319
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,800
<font color="yellow">Why? Because I'm Writer Kwon's guardian.</font>

320
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,840
<font color="yellow">That's my spot. Don't lie down.</font>

321
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,360
<font color="yellow">Why are you bumming here? Get up.</font>

322
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,440
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you shouldn't do this
to your guardian.</font>

323
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,400
<font color="yellow">Don't fall asleep.</font>

324
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,600
<font color="yellow">I'm going to throw you out.</font>

325
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,440
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, what does it feel like
to get divorced?</font>

326
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,480
<font color="yellow">Does it feel refreshing?</font>

327
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,760
<font color="yellow">If you are that curious,
why don't you try it yourself?</font>

328
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,720
<font color="yellow">I'm curious.</font>

329
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,320
<font color="yellow">I was wondering how others feel...</font>

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,720
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

331
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
<font color="yellow">What is this? He fell asleep.</font>

332
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,200
<font color="yellow">Mom is sleeping.</font>

333
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,840
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say. Just leave.</font>

334
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,920
<font color="yellow">I have something to say.</font>

335
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,800
<font color="yellow">I don't want to listen to your excuses.</font>

336
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,440
<font color="yellow">It's not an excuse.</font>

337
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,400
<font color="yellow">For now, I'm not going to
see him anymore.</font>

338
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,680
<font color="yellow">For now?</font>

339
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,360
<font color="yellow">What do you mean "for now?"</font>

340
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,440
<font color="yellow">Are you letting me know that you
are going to see him later?</font>

341
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,800
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm that dumb?</font>

342
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,080
<font color="yellow">I have nothing I want to ask you.
And I don't want to listen to you.</font>

343
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,240
<font color="yellow">After Mom leaves, leave Joon Soo here
and leave the house, okay?</font>

344
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,720
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

345
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,680
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

346
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,680
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

347
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,320
<font color="yellow">Dad, we are going to the amusement park.</font>

348
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,880
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

349
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,520
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

350
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,920
<font color="yellow">You should get ready too.</font>

351
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,880
<font color="yellow">Everyone sends their kids
camping and stuff.</font>

352
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,080
<font color="yellow">They don't keep the kids at home.</font>

353
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,280
<font color="yellow">Instead of telling him to turn off the
TV and not play with cell phone</font>

354
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,800
<font color="yellow">play with him on the weekends.</font>

355
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,520
<font color="yellow">Try to be nice and make up for it.</font>

356
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,560
<font color="yellow">Give Soo Yeon a chance to rest.</font>

357
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,480
<font color="yellow">We don't have time to
waste on those things.</font>

358
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,480
<font color="yellow">You are the one who cheated.
How could you say that?</font>

359
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,800
<font color="yellow">Mom, he is busy today.</font>

360
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,360
<font color="yellow">You should go to work. Hurry.
You might be late.</font>

361
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,480
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is driving me crazy.</font>

362
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,680
<font color="yellow">They have all the paintings
that you like.</font>

363
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
<font color="yellow">It will totally change
the feel of the house</font>

364
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,560
<font color="yellow">if we hang it
on the living room wall, right?</font>

365
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,680
<font color="yellow">We could buy it as an investment</font>

366
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,080
<font color="yellow">but it's a bit too much
to hang it on our wall.</font>

367
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,240
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

368
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,120
<font color="yellow">You studied art and you have different
views when you look at these pieces.</font>

369
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,280
<font color="yellow">I think I'm distracting you.</font>

370
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,320
<font color="yellow">I will be quiet. I will be over there.</font>

371
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,480
<font color="yellow">Enjoy it.</font>

372
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,360
<font color="yellow">That piece looks a bit boring.</font>

373
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,120
<font color="yellow">That's boring, right?</font>

374
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:59,440
<font color="yellow">That piece looks boring,
but it's also thrilling.</font>

375
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,760
<font color="yellow">Should we make it more thrilling?</font>

376
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,440
<font color="yellow">We should do this often.</font>

377
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,920
<font color="yellow">You don't like art that much.
I'm sorry. I'm making you bored.</font>

378
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,520
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I don't like looking
at art pieces.</font>

379
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,680
<font color="yellow">But I like the person
looking at the pieces. You.</font>

380
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,480
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

381
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,040
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

382
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,360
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

383
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,680
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
- What are you doing?</font>

384
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,280
<font color="yellow">People might see us.</font>

385
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,440
<font color="yellow">Who cares?</font>

386
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
<font color="yellow">You are my baby.</font>

387
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,240
<font color="yellow">That's right. You eat so well.</font>

388
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,080
<font color="yellow">Let's start the meeting.
Producer Bae, how did the editing go?</font>

389
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,680
<font color="yellow">- It's ready.
- Okay.</font>

390
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,480
<font color="yellow">Then Producer Ahn just has
to get his ready.</font>

391
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Producer Ahn.</font>

392
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,080
<font color="yellow">We are in the meeting room.</font>

393
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,880
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

394
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,160
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

395
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,720
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

396
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,640
<font color="yellow">Am I the only one not okay?</font>

397
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,400
<font color="yellow">We are having a meeting.
Will you be okay?</font>

398
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,880
<font color="yellow">Take your time. I will be in there.</font>

399
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,520
<font color="yellow">Tell us more about your experience.</font>

400
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,720
<font color="yellow">It's all because of the husband.
It's his fault.</font>

401
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,200
<font color="yellow">Getting divorced is the solution, One.
He should forgive her, Two.</font>

402
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,760
<font color="yellow">- One.
- Two.</font>

403
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,200
<font color="yellow">One of them has to die for this to end.</font>

404
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,000
<font color="yellow">Han River's water temperature is
above 0 degrees Celsius today.</font>

405
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
<font color="yellow">Come here quickly.</font>

406
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,560
<font color="yellow">It must have been very tough.
You went though a lot.</font>

407
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,520
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

408
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,000
<font color="yellow">You said everything has ended.</font>

409
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,400
<font color="yellow">But I think this is the beginning.</font>

410
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,200
<font color="yellow">Your wife would not
have told you the truth</font>

411
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
<font color="yellow">without knowing how she feels.</font>

412
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,560
<font color="yellow">And without telling her how you feel...</font>

413
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,640
<font color="yellow">Did you really want to end it like this?</font>

414
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,520
<font color="yellow">Why did your wife
want to have an affair?</font>

415
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,280
<font color="yellow">Did you not do anything wrong?</font>

416
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,360
<font color="yellow">Wrong?</font>

417
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,080
<font color="yellow">Does that mean it's my fault
that she cheated on me?</font>

418
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,680
<font color="yellow">Now that I think about it,
it makes me upset.</font>

419
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,600
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

420
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,280
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

421
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,880
<font color="yellow">- You met another man.
- What's wrong with that?</font>

422
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,200
<font color="yellow">- You have a kid.
- I can't date a man if I have a kid?</font>

423
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,800
<font color="yellow">How could you say that?
You have a husband!</font>

424
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,040
<font color="yellow">Even if you beg me,
that won't be enough.</font>

425
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,840
<font color="yellow">Why would I beg you?
We can just get divorced.</font>

426
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,800
<font color="yellow">All this time...  I was dumb.</font>

427
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,320
<font color="yellow">I don't need the kid anymore.</font>

428
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,520
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I don't want to see them
because they look like you.</font>

429
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,080
<font color="yellow">What? Are you going to hit me?</font>

430
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,320
<font color="yellow">Okay, hit me. I didn't want to
give you alimony.</font>

431
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,160
<font color="yellow">Let's settle it like this. Hit me.</font>

432
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,560
<font color="yellow">Why can't you hit me? Hit me--</font>

433
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,880
<font color="yellow">We can't use this, right?</font>

434
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,920
<font color="yellow">We could have got something better
if I held back a bit.</font>

435
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,680
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

436
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,200
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry to the client.</font>

437
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
<font color="yellow">He couldn't ask what he wanted
to ask her because of me.</font>

438
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,000
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

439
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,920
<font color="yellow">You might want to know why that person
wants to break up.</font>

440
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,000
<font color="yellow">He must have been the same.</font>

441
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,440
<font color="yellow">"What happened to my wife?"</font>

442
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,280
<font color="yellow">"Why did my wife cheat on me?"</font>

443
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,120
<font color="yellow">"By any chance,
did I do anything wrong?"</font>

444
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,320
<font color="yellow">Why did your wife
want to have an affair?</font>

445
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,640
<font color="yellow">Did you do anything wrong?</font>

446
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,840
<font color="yellow">If we can't use this,
should I delete it?</font>

447
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,400
<font color="yellow">No, we can use it.</font>

448
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,240
<font color="yellow">We could make a good preview clip
out of that.</font>

449
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,040
<font color="yellow">What should we do about the filming?</font>

450
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,160
<font color="yellow">The couple talking face to face...</font>

451
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,720
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a good idea?</font>

452
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. It seems realistic, and there's
some tension involved as well.</font>

453
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,000
<font color="yellow">Seeing them sitting down like that
reminds me of that TV show Tongue War.</font>

454
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
<font color="yellow">Tongue War. That's right.
It has that feel to it.</font>

455
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,760
<font color="yellow">- Tongue War is a good idea.
- Tongue War.</font>

456
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,360
<font color="yellow">The war of the fierce women.</font>

457
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,200
<font color="yellow">Our concept is way more intense.</font>

458
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,560
<font color="yellow">Then aren't we supposed to have someone
like Kim Gu Ra? To balance it out?</font>

459
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,040
<font color="yellow">- We have a perfect candidate.
- Who?</font>

460
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,920
<font color="yellow">About Hyun Woo's program.</font>

461
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,080
<font color="yellow">Do they really have to
film on the weekend?</font>

462
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,520
<font color="yellow">They are only available on the weekends.</font>

463
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,080
<font color="yellow">Should I just say no to them?</font>

464
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
<font color="yellow">I don't even have time to be with you.</font>

465
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,920
<font color="yellow">- Should I say no?
- That's okay.</font>

466
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,680
<font color="yellow">I signed up for a flower arrangement
class in the next building.</font>

467
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,560
<font color="yellow">I stay near you
and I can look after you.</font>

468
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,920
<font color="yellow">You could have done it somewhere
near our house.</font>

469
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,200
<font color="yellow">Flower arrangement is very important.</font>

470
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,240
<font color="yellow">So don't even worry about me, okay?</font>

471
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,400
<font color="yellow">I'm using that as an excuse
to go to work with you.</font>

472
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,640
<font color="yellow">It makes my heart flutter.</font>

473
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,320
<font color="yellow">It makes my heart flutter too.</font>

474
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,640
<font color="yellow">- Oh.
- What is this? You are bleeding.</font>

475
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,200
<font color="yellow">Isn't this too dangerous?</font>

476
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,320
<font color="yellow">You could die from this.</font>

477
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,080
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do this.</font>

478
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,680
<font color="yellow">- I'm okay.
- No, no, you're not okay.</font>

479
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,280
<font color="yellow">Flower arrangement is too dangerous.
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?</font>

480
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,600
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. You can go.
- Let's go to the hospital.</font>

481
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,280
<font color="yellow">- I don't have to go to the hospital.
- No way.</font>

482
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,000
<font color="yellow">It's that fitness center right there.</font>

483
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,640
<font color="yellow">It's the fitness center, "Health Line."</font>

484
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,560
<font color="yellow">It's the fitness center, "Health Line."</font>

485
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,920
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

486
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,000
<font color="yellow">I'm too full.</font>

487
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,200
<font color="yellow">I can't put the belt on for you.</font>

488
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,480
<font color="yellow">It's okay. You don't have a belly.</font>

489
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,160
<font color="yellow">No. Look at this.
I can't even reach for the belt.</font>

490
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,040
<font color="yellow">I think I should start exercising.
For your sake.</font>

491
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,440
<font color="yellow">That's a good idea.
I'll search for a personal trainer.</font>

492
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,600
<font color="yellow">No. I should exercise
where there's a lot of people.</font>

493
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,840
<font color="yellow">To be more motivated.</font>

494
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,160
<font color="yellow">I should go to that place.</font>

495
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,880
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat lunch, right?</font>

496
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

497
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,280
<font color="yellow">It's tuna and mayonnaise.</font>

498
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
<font color="yellow">It's tuna and mayonnaise.</font>

499
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,160
<font color="yellow">Do you not like anything greasy?</font>

500
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,680
<font color="yellow">Do you like tuna and mayonnaise?</font>

501
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

502
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,640
<font color="yellow">Since I live alone, and I'm too lazy to
cook, I tried all kinds of instant food.</font>

503
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,480
<font color="yellow">I think this is the best.</font>

504
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,080
<font color="yellow">Bo Young, by any chance...</font>

505
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,240
<font color="yellow">Do you have stocks?</font>

506
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,200
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?
Do you not remember?</font>

507
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,360
<font color="yellow">I think it was about
seven, eight years ago.</font>

508
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,160
<font color="yellow">You said a blue bird sat on
your shoulder in your dream.</font>

509
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,040
<font color="yellow">You said that blue bird said
"Blue fund."</font>

510
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,480
<font color="yellow">So all of our team bought blue fund</font>

511
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,000
<font color="yellow">and we all lost a lot of money.</font>

512
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,320
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji who used to sit next to me
lost her deposit too.</font>

513
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,600
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

514
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,800
<font color="yellow">Is Hyun Ji doing well?</font>

515
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,120
<font color="yellow">After that, she was so shocked
that she quit writing</font>

516
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,720
<font color="yellow">and she works in a factory.</font>

517
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,160
<font color="yellow">Really? A factory?</font>

518
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,680
<font color="yellow">Because of me?</font>

519
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,120
<font color="yellow">It's so easy to fool you. I'm proud.</font>

520
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,120
<font color="yellow">Hyun Ji has a kid now. She's doing well.</font>

521
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,400
<font color="yellow">I haven't done stocks since then.</font>

522
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,120
<font color="yellow">I sometimes go to the stock gallery
to get some sources.</font>

523
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,480
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? Then by any chance, you--</font>

524
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,720
<font color="yellow">Hello? Oh, yes.</font>

525
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,560
<font color="yellow">Today?</font>

526
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,040
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

527
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,520
<font color="yellow">Producer Do, you should go see the CEO.</font>

528
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,120
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

529
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,400
<font color="yellow">- I said I'm here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

530
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,600
<font color="yellow">There's a post I follow these days.</font>

531
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,120
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

532
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,640
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

533
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,280
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

534
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,880
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

535
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,000
<font color="yellow">It's not a big deal.</font>

536
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,040
<font color="yellow">How is Writer Kwon doing?</font>

537
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,200
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

538
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,440
<font color="yellow">I heard a strange rumor.</font>

539
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,800
<font color="yellow">Another team is trying to scout her.</font>

540
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,240
<font color="yellow">She gets those offers all the time.</font>

541
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,480
<font color="yellow">There are many producers
who want our program to fail</font>

542
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,160
<font color="yellow">so that they can take Bo Young.</font>

543
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,760
<font color="yellow">Who? Who are those bastards?</font>

544
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,440
<font color="yellow">What would you do if you found out
who they are? We actually failed.</font>

545
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,720
<font color="yellow">Anyway. There's a rumor that she is
actually going to sign the contract.</font>

546
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,000
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't sign a contract
behind our back.</font>

547
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,160
<font color="yellow">But the rumor sounds too real.</font>

548
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,800
<font color="yellow">You know Producer Oh Ki Han, right?</font>

549
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,680
<font color="yellow">The one who made
"Dear My Love Geum Dong."</font>

550
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,400
<font color="yellow">I heard she is going to sign
a contract with him.</font>

551
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
<font color="yellow">How could she do this to us?</font>

552
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,360
<font color="yellow">I'm really...</font>

553
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,360
<font color="yellow">I'm upset.</font>

554
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,240
<font color="yellow">This is very annoying.</font>

555
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,880
<font color="yellow">I trusted her.
How could she do this to us?</font>

556
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,520
<font color="yellow">We are making a program now.</font>

557
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,080
<font color="yellow">How could she betray us like this?</font>

558
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,160
<font color="yellow">- Hey, you sit down.
- Betray... Betray...</font>

559
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,480
<font color="yellow">I can't breathe.</font>

560
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,080
<font color="yellow">Breathe.</font>

561
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,360
<font color="yellow">Let it out.</font>

562
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,920
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right.</font>

563
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,520
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will call you back. Thank you.</font>

564
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,640
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

565
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,840
<font color="yellow">Producer Oh Ki Han asked people if
there's any good variety show writers.</font>

566
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,200
<font color="yellow">And some of the writers talked
about Writer Kwon.</font>

567
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,840
<font color="yellow">Right. Bo Young wrote a sitcom too.</font>

568
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,720
<font color="yellow">Do you know when their meeting is?</font>

569
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,440
<font color="yellow">I think it's today.</font>

570
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,280
<font color="yellow">- Today?
- Yes.</font>

571
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,240
<font color="yellow">I heard her talking with Eun Jung.</font>

572
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,160
<font color="yellow">Should I print all the stories I found
so that you can read it at night?</font>

573
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
<font color="yellow">Let's do that tomorrow.</font>

574
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,400
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting tonight.
I can't go to our meeting.</font>

575
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,720
<font color="yellow">Hello? Oh, yes. Today?</font>

576
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,680
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

577
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

578
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,400
<font color="yellow">I think it's today.</font>

579
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,280
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

580
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,040
<font color="yellow">You signed up to exercise, right?</font>

581
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,640
<font color="yellow">- Yes, that's me.
- We will go right in.</font>

582
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,520
<font color="yellow">The most important pose
in fitness is the squat.</font>

583
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,120
<font color="yellow">You have to build your lower body
muscle to build your upper body muscle.</font>

584
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,320
<font color="yellow">It's that important a pose.</font>

585
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,520
<font color="yellow">To do a squat, fold your arms.</font>

586
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,880
<font color="yellow">Pull your waist back.</font>

587
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,720
<font color="yellow">Bend it.</font>

588
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,000
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

589
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
<font color="yellow">Push it forward.</font>

590
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,680
<font color="yellow">You have to do it with power
in your lower back.</font>

591
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,360
<font color="yellow">Hip exercises are very important.</font>

592
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,280
<font color="yellow">I can see that.</font>

593
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,240
<font color="yellow">- You should try it.
- When you bend down--</font>

594
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,160
<font color="yellow">- Fold my arms.
- Yes, fold your arms.</font>

595
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,400
<font color="yellow">Pull your waist back.</font>

596
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,080
<font color="yellow">Bend your legs.</font>

597
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,040
<font color="yellow">Keep your upper body straight.</font>

598
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,280
<font color="yellow">Put your weight on your hip.</font>

599
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,880
<font color="yellow">- Oh, yes.
- We will do three sets of 30 squats.</font>

600
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,680
<font color="yellow">Three sets of 30 squats?</font>

601
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,600
<font color="yellow">90 times? We can do 100 times instead.</font>

602
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,320
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to give it a try?
- Okay, let's do 100 times then.</font>

603
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,040
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Start. One.</font>

604
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,160
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

605
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,240
<font color="yellow">Keep it straight.</font>

606
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,760
<font color="yellow">Keep going. Two.</font>

607
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,680
<font color="yellow">Bend it.</font>

608
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,320
<font color="yellow">- You have to go down all the way.
- Okay.</font>

609
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,440
<font color="yellow">Keep your upper body up.</font>

610
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,320
<font color="yellow">Bring it up.</font>

611
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,680
<font color="yellow">Keep your legs steady.</font>

612
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,360
<font color="yellow">Bring it up.</font>

613
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,360
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

614
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,280
<font color="yellow">- You have to focus. Stand up.
- Okay.</font>

615
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,760
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

616
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,520
<font color="yellow">You have five left.</font>

617
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,400
<font color="yellow">48.</font>

618
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,600
<font color="yellow">Stop. You can step down.</font>

619
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,720
<font color="yellow">Please check my pose.</font>

620
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,360
<font color="yellow">- Just a moment please.
- Go drink some water.</font>

621
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,840
<font color="yellow">We will restart right away.</font>

622
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,600
<font color="yellow">Go all the way down.</font>

623
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,080
<font color="yellow">I will get going first...</font>

624
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,000
<font color="yellow">Where is Producer Do?</font>

625
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,920
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

626
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
<font color="yellow">I said I'm leaving. Bye.</font>

627
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,800
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

628
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,680
<font color="yellow">Are we not going to stop her?</font>

629
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,000
<font color="yellow">Let's just trust her.
Writer Kwon won't do--</font>

630
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,320
<font color="yellow">What do you mean trust her?</font>

631
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,360
<font color="yellow">When a woman decides to leave,
that's it.</font>

632
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,080
<font color="yellow">Oh? Are you leaving?</font>

633
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,440
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

634
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,160
<font color="yellow">It got too loose. Just like
your skin get loose as you age.</font>

635
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,360
<font color="yellow">A couple gets loose too.</font>

636
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,520
<font color="yellow">What's important is the kind of ending
that writer wants.</font>

637
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,800
<font color="yellow">If I loved him</font>

638
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,040
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have ran away from him.</font>

639
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,760
<font color="yellow">Even if we ended up breaking up,
I should have made that clear.</font>

640
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,920
<font color="yellow">You don't have to hurry when you
break up with someone.</font>

641
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,000
<font color="yellow">You should put your guard down first.</font>

642
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,360
<font color="yellow">The thing that made the wanderer
take off his coat</font>

643
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,000
<font color="yellow">was not a cold wind, but warm sunshine.</font>

644
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,560
<font color="yellow">Approach it with a pure heart.</font>

645
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,120
<font color="yellow">And listen to her story.</font>

646
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,560
<font color="yellow">Bo Young, do you have a minute?</font>

647
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,080
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead.
- Let's meet and talk.</font>

648
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,840
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

649
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,440
<font color="yellow">But I have an appointment.
I'm not in the area, what should we do?</font>

650
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,360
<font color="yellow">I will go there. Where are you?</font>

651
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,280
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

652
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,560
<font color="yellow">- Producer Do, to be honest, I--
- Yes, I know.</font>

653
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,360
<font color="yellow">I know, so let's talk in person.
Where are you?</font>

654
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,080
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

655
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,680
<font color="yellow">Woongsan in Nonhyeondong.</font>

656
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,360
<font color="yellow">Am I a taxi driver or something?</font>

657
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,160
<font color="yellow">Bo Young said she's there.
Hurry and punch it in.</font>

658
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,000
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- Woongsan.</font>

659
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,680
<font color="yellow">- Woongsan.
- Yes.</font>

660
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,200
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

661
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,200
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

662
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,040
<font color="yellow">- Producer Do.
- Bo Young.</font>

663
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,880
<font color="yellow">It's too early. You shouldn't do this.</font>

664
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,400
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know I didn't do
any good for you.</font>

665
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,240
<font color="yellow">I asked you to carry out too many
things because I had a trust in you.</font>

666
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,760
<font color="yellow">I should have done better before
something like this would happen.</font>

667
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,320
<font color="yellow">I realize how important that person is
only after something like this happens.</font>

668
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,440
<font color="yellow">I will do better. I will change.</font>

669
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,800
<font color="yellow">Producer Do.</font>

670
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,160
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

671
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,520
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, if this
is not going to work, I will...</font>

672
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,840
<font color="yellow">But you are not Producer Oh Ki Han.</font>

673
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,320
<font color="yellow">You look nice today.</font>

674
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,160
<font color="yellow">You look pretty.</font>

675
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,320
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

676
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,200
<font color="yellow">Something doesn't seem right.</font>

677
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,000
<font color="yellow">Are you on a blind date?</font>

678
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,520
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

679
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,760
<font color="yellow">I'm very sorry. Don't misunderstand me.</font>

680
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,440
<font color="yellow">I'm her senior at work.
Regarding our work...</font>

681
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,240
<font color="yellow">Our Writer Kwon Bo Young is the most
talented and prettiest person at work.</font>

682
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,080
<font color="yellow">Have a great time. I'm sorry.</font>

683
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,640
<font color="yellow">Why are you alone?
What about Writer Kwon?</font>

684
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,240
<font color="yellow">- It's not that.
- What do you mean it's not that?</font>

685
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,280
<font color="yellow">Bo Young is on a blind date.</font>

686
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,080
<font color="yellow">Oh, blind date?</font>

687
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,800
<font color="yellow">Blind date?</font>

688
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,520
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

689
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,760
<font color="yellow">Oh, you got your hair done too.</font>

690
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,160
<font color="yellow">You put makeup on too.</font>

691
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,920
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

692
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,080
<font color="yellow">You're wearing a skirt.</font>

693
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,480
<font color="yellow">She's wearing a skirt.</font>

694
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,800
<font color="yellow">- It's a blind date.
- Yes.</font>

695
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,280
<font color="yellow">She has been married once.
She wants to get married again?</font>

696
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,240
<font color="yellow">She's a weirdo--</font>

697
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,280
<font color="yellow">It's way too hard. I can't do this.</font>

698
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,640
<font color="yellow">- Fitness.
- Yes.</font>

699
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,320
<font color="yellow">Have fun.</font>

700
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,600
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

701
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,280
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

702
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,680
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

703
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,720
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

704
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,480
<font color="yellow">I thought you were transferring
to a new team. I'm very sorry.</font>

705
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,440
<font color="yellow">I never thought that you would
go on a blind date.</font>

706
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,920
<font color="yellow">Huh? Why?</font>

707
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,800
<font color="yellow">Can't I go on a blind date?</font>

708
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,200
<font color="yellow">Do you mean no one could want
to go on a date with me?</font>

709
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,160
<font color="yellow">No, that's not what I meant. I'm sorry.</font>

710
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,840
<font color="yellow">Did you really want to go
on a blind date?</font>

711
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,040
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

712
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,920
<font color="yellow">My senior kept on asking me to do
him a favor, so I couldn't say no.</font>

713
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,200
<font color="yellow">I will apologize to you again.
I'm so sorry.</font>

714
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,440
<font color="yellow">But I was glad.</font>

715
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,240
<font color="yellow">I felt like an important person.
At least a bit.</font>

716
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,560
<font color="yellow">Right? You saw how I really felt, right?</font>

717
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,760
<font color="yellow">- Bo Young.
- Yes?</font>

718
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,680
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you a strange question?</font>

719
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,440
<font color="yellow">That Toycrane. The one who
posts those stories online.</font>

720
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,720
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

721
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,400
<font color="yellow">What do you think about him?</font>

722
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,280
<font color="yellow">He is a lame person.</font>

723
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,080
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

724
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,040
<font color="yellow">I feel bad saying this
about someone I don't know.</font>

725
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,080
<font color="yellow">But he is just a dumb.</font>

726
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,440
<font color="yellow">- Oh.
- But.</font>

727
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,160
<font color="yellow">For some reason, I want to root for him.</font>

728
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,760
<font color="yellow">It doesn't sound like a total
stranger's story. I feel for him.</font>

729
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,080
<font color="yellow">I told you my husband cheated on me.</font>

730
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,400
<font color="yellow">I don't want him to fail like me.</font>

731
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,000
<font color="yellow">Isn't that how everyone is?</font>

732
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,160
<font color="yellow">If you step in a puddle and get wet,
and someone else comes along</font>

733
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,320
<font color="yellow">you warn that person about the puddle.</font>

734
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,880
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

735
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,680
<font color="yellow">Get in. I'll give you a ride.</font>

736
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,280
<font color="yellow">You can go first. I will go later.</font>

737
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,160
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you tomorrow.</font>

738
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,760
<font color="yellow">- Give her a ride home.
- Okay, bye.</font>

739
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,600
<font color="yellow">I will say just one thing.</font>

740
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,480
<font color="yellow">You are dead if you tell other people.</font>

741
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,200
<font color="yellow">About what? Your blind date.</font>

742
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,640
<font color="yellow">Your makeup? Your skirt?</font>

743
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,160
<font color="yellow">Everything.</font>

744
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,240
<font color="yellow">Why did you go on a blind date
all of a sudden?</font>

745
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,240
<font color="yellow">My senior asked me a favor
and I had no choice. Why?</font>

746
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,760
<font color="yellow">You had no choice?</font>

747
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,680
<font color="yellow">How could you go on
a blind date like that?</font>

748
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,880
<font color="yellow">Your life depends on that.</font>

749
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,520
<font color="yellow">If you couldn't say no again...</font>

750
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,320
<font color="yellow">I thought about getting married again
if he is a good guy.</font>

751
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,480
<font color="yellow">- Why? Can't I do that?
- But, still...</font>

752
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,480
<font color="yellow">You can. You can.</font>

753
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,560
<font color="yellow">You can. You can. You can. You can.</font>

754
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,760
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Hot pepper Tuna.</font>

755
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,280
<font color="yellow">Oh, Tuna Mayo.</font>

756
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,560
<font color="yellow">Dear Tuna Mayo.</font>

757
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,600
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful for you.</font>

758
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,760
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about talking with
my wife again.</font>

759
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,880
<font color="yellow">I want to hear how she really feels.</font>

760
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,320
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get divorced either.</font>

761
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,480
<font color="yellow">Is she not here yet?</font>

762
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,600
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo and Joon Soo's Mom
will stay at my house tonight.</font>

763
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,040
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Mom.</font>

764
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,720
<font color="yellow">What's the need to do this?</font>

765
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,240
<font color="yellow">Mom, it's me.</font>

766
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,320
<font color="yellow">- Are you home?
- Yes.</font>

767
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,360
<font color="yellow">Your Dad came to pick me up,
but Joon Soo insisted</font>

768
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,040
<font color="yellow">on going with his grandfather.
So we brought them here.</font>

769
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,040
<font color="yellow">Let me talk to Soo Yeon.</font>

770
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,320
<font color="yellow">She's taking a shower.</font>

771
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,480
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? When she comes out</font>

772
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,080
<font color="yellow">tell her to come home.
Tell her I have something to tell her.</font>

773
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,320
<font color="yellow">And you take care of Joon Soo
just one more day.</font>

774
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,040
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

775
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,840
<font color="yellow">Beg her.</font>

776
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,640
<font color="yellow">- Don't make her cry.
- It's not like that.</font>

777
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,040
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

778
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,600
<font color="yellow">Tell her to hurry and come home.</font>

779
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

780
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,440
<font color="yellow">Now, I feel more like myself.</font>

781
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,000
<font color="yellow">Should I start working on my
fantastic story plan?</font>

782
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,840
<font color="yellow">Don't skip a meal and eat this.
I earn enough to buy you a meal.</font>

783
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,480
<font color="yellow">I will enjoy it.</font>

784
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

785
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,640
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

786
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,320
<font color="yellow">Can I talk first?</font>

787
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

788
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

789
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,080
<font color="yellow">I know we can't put this behind us
just like this.</font>

790
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,560
<font color="yellow">I didn't do that to get divorced.</font>

791
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,680
<font color="yellow">Since when was it?</font>

792
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,040
<font color="yellow">Since when was it?</font>

793
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,040
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you when did it start?</font>

794
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,120
<font color="yellow">Was that a one-time thing?</font>

795
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,840
<font color="yellow">Or have you been seeing him for a while?</font>

796
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,200
<font color="yellow">How long have you been deceiving me?</font>

797
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,320
<font color="yellow">I know you can't understand me
saying this...</font>

798
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,040
<font color="yellow">But I didn't mean to deceive you.</font>

799
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,640
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes sense?</font>

800
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,800
<font color="yellow">Were you going to ask my
permission to cheat on me then?</font>

801
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,520
<font color="yellow">You know that's not what I mean.</font>

802
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,320
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell what's going on here?</font>

803
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,640
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can say that to me?</font>

804
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,520
<font color="yellow">Aren't you supposed to beg me
to forgive you first?</font>

805
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,600
<font color="yellow">You can't tell me if
this makes sense or not.</font>

806
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,880
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

807
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,000
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

808
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,160
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
We are getting divorced.</font>

809
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,680
<font color="yellow">If you are like this,
do you think I can forgive you?</font>

810
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,680
<font color="yellow">On that day,
why didn't you follow me?</font>

811
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,920
<font color="yellow">Why did you stay there
with that bastard?</font>

812
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,600
<font color="yellow">Did you tell him "I cheated on him
because my husband is a fool"?</font>

813
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,400
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

814
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,280
<font color="yellow">I will sleep at Mom's place tonight.</font>

815
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,520
<font color="yellow">Let's talk again when you calm down.</font>

816
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,320
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about leaving.</font>

817
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,040
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Since when was it?</font>

818
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,880
<font color="yellow">When was it?</font>

819
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,320
<font color="yellow">Six months ago.</font>

820
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,120
<font color="yellow">What? Six months ago?</font>

821
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,800
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with him?</font>

822
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,320
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk anymore.</font>

823
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,040
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with him?</font>

824
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,680
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

825
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,760
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with him?</font>

826
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, I slept with him.</font>

827
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
<font color="yellow">I missed him.</font>

828
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,240
<font color="yellow">I missed him all this time.</font>

829
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,720
<font color="yellow">So I asked him to meet me.</font>

830
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,520
<font color="yellow">Dear Tuna Mayo.</font>

831
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,680
<font color="yellow">I tried to talk with my wife.</font>

832
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,320
<font color="yellow">But I failed.</font>

833
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,400
<font color="yellow">My wife really cheated on me.</font>

834
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,560
<font color="yellow">I still tried to ask her.</font>

835
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,280
<font color="yellow">I tried to listen to her.
But nothing is going my way.</font>

836
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,720
<font color="yellow">- Producer Do.
- Yes.</font>

837
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,240
<font color="yellow">You didn't respond to my question.</font>

838
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,800
<font color="yellow">I tried to talk with her
and listen to what she has to say.</font>

839
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,720
<font color="yellow">But my wife left our house.</font>

840
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,840
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I'm that Toy...</font>

841
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,440
<font color="yellow">[Pudding]</font>

842
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,200
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

843
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,360
<font color="yellow">Is your ID "Pudding?"</font>

844
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

845
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,520
<font color="yellow">Your wife left the house?</font>

846
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,360
<font color="yellow">Huh? Oh.</font>

847
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,160
<font color="yellow">And so I was going to...</font>

848
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,640
<font color="yellow">have a drink with you.</font>

849
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,840
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you drink alone
a lot these days?</font>

850
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. But I have to finish
my story plan today.</font>

851
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,320
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right.</font>

852
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,280
<font color="yellow">I should call Joon Young over then.</font>

853
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,800
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

854
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,040
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will get going.</font>

855
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,040
<font color="yellow">Since when was your ID "Pudding?"</font>

856
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,080
<font color="yellow">It has been a long time.</font>

857
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,760
<font color="yellow">- Oh, it has been a long time.
- Yes.</font>

858
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,400
<font color="yellow">I will get going.</font>

859
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,040
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

860
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,880
<font color="yellow">- You can just go buy--
- It's hot. I'm a mom.</font>

861
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,160
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

862
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,280
<font color="yellow">- Good morning.
- Good morning.</font>

863
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,080
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

864
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,560
<font color="yellow">Bo Young, I heard you went
on a blind date yesterday?</font>

865
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,360
<font color="yellow">I heard you wore a skirt too.</font>

866
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,880
<font color="yellow">Your makeup was amazing.</font>

867
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,160
<font color="yellow">So did you sleep with him?</font>

868
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,760
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

869
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,360
<font color="yellow">You got dumped.</font>

870
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,000
<font color="yellow">All right. Where is Producer Ahn?</font>

871
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,680
<font color="yellow">- He's in the meeting room.
- Oh, meeting room?</font>

872
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,800
<font color="yellow">You are here.</font>

873
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,480
<font color="yellow">I lost my most precious thing.</font>

874
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,720
<font color="yellow">It's up. It's up.</font>

875
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,040
<font color="yellow">- Where?
- Where?</font>

876
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,880
<font color="yellow">My wife cheated on me.</font>

877
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,440
<font color="yellow">Team Leader Jung, the tile--</font>

878
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,800
<font color="yellow">But I couldn't hear a reasonable
reason from her.</font>

879
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,440
<font color="yellow">Team Leader Jung, line three.
Manager Ji Sun Woo is on the line.</font>

880
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,200
<font color="yellow">This is Jung Soo Yeon.</font>

881
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,800
<font color="yellow">Team Leader Jung, line three.
Manager Ji Sun Woo is on the line.</font>

882
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,360
<font color="yellow">This is Jung Soo Yeon.</font>

883
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,680
<font color="yellow">Could you take a look at it
as soon as you are done editing?</font>

884
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,480
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will take a look at it soon.</font>

885
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,920
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

886
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,600
<font color="yellow">I have no choice
but to hear it from him.</font>

887
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,720
<font color="yellow">I can't forgive</font>

888
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,360
<font color="yellow">my wife or him.</font>

889
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,640
<font color="yellow">I can't forgive</font>

890
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,640
<font color="yellow">my wife or him.</font>

891
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,640
<font color="yellow">This week...</font>

892
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,080
<font color="yellow">I'm going to fight the guy...</font>

893
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,640
<font color="yellow">who took away the most
precious thing from me.</font>

894

<font color="yellow">BioskopKeren</font>

895
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,120
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Ji Sun Woo.</font>

896
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,240
<font color="yellow">I didn't come here to say hello to you.</font>

897
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,440
<font color="yellow">J Motors wants to change
the Project Manager.</font>

898
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,360
<font color="yellow">It would have been nice if you
could've told me ahead of time.</font>

899
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,040
<font color="yellow">Your husband came to my company
to see me.</font>

900
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,080
<font color="yellow">Not that many people come here because
they have a problem in their marriage.</font>

901
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,080
<font color="yellow">Do you have a problem with your wife?</font>

902
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,640
<font color="yellow">- Oh.
- Did you get a new cologne?</font>

903
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,680
<font color="yellow">No, it's the one I always use.</font>

904
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,440
<font color="yellow">You can do the impossible.
That's why cheating is thrilling.</font>

905
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,040
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it's thrilling?</font>

906
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,360
<font color="yellow">Think about that spouse on the other
side. How could you say that?</font>

907
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,160
<font color="yellow">It seems like there is no clear
suspect or a victim.</font>

908
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,880
<font color="yellow">They didn't really mean to do that.</font>

909
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,160
<font color="yellow">Call her.</font>

910
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,840
<font color="yellow">Call your wife who is asleep without
knowing what's happening to her.</font>

911
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,440
<font color="yellow">Call her if you don't want
things to get messy!</font>
