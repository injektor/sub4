<font color="yellow">You're going to do this?</font>

6
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,214
<font color="yellow">Mom!
Dad!</font>

7
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:34,048
<font color="yellow">We're here.</font>

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,920
<font color="yellow">Mom, you came?</font>

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,100
<font color="yellow">Grandma bought me this.</font>

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,905
<font color="yellow">You're so lucky.</font>

11
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:49,673
<font color="yellow">What did you do
that she wants to separate with you?</font>

12
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:51,787
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

13
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:53,421
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

14
00:00:57,692 --> 00:01:02,207
<font color="yellow">I thought you two were
thinking things out while living apart.</font>

15
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:06,106
<font color="yellow">I will never allow
the two of you to separate.</font>

16
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:07,995
<font color="yellow">What about Joon Soo?</font>

17
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:13,090
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you kill each other,
but do it while living together.</font>

18
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,924
<font color="yellow">He's my son, but he
deserves what he gets.</font>

19
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:17,718
<font color="yellow">- Mother, I have something to tell you...
- Be quiet.</font>

20
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,743
<font color="yellow">Go, it's our problem.
We'll take care of it.</font>

21
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:25,477
<font color="yellow">- Come on, get up.
- I have my reasons.</font>

22
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:27,873
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because you
can't resolve this alone.</font>

23
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:29,706
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mom.</font>

24
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:33,224
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

25
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:40,902
<font color="yellow">Marriage isn't something
you can easily undo.</font>

26
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:45,873
<font color="yellow">It's easy to separate, but once
you do it, it'll be hard to undo.</font>

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,662
<font color="yellow">Think about it carefully.</font>

28
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,004
<font color="yellow">You really have to do this?</font>

29
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,561
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

30
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:02,221
<font color="yellow">If we stay together, it will
just hurt our feelings more.</font>

31
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,084
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?
You have somewhere to go?</font>

32
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:12,334
<font color="yellow">Oh, you gave up on being a wife, so
you won't be a mother, either, now?</font>

33
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:19,221
<font color="yellow">I'll take Joon Soo with me.</font>

34
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:21,189
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

35
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,610
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

36
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,733
<font color="yellow">Stay, I'll leave.</font>

37
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:30,222
<font color="yellow">Don't get the wrong idea.
This is because of Joon Soo.</font>

38
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:33,271
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- It's okay?</font>

39
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,984
<font color="yellow">Just stay.</font>

40
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,853
<font color="yellow">Don't do this to Joon Soo.</font>

41
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,413
<font color="yellow">Where are you going to take
that sleeping child?</font>

42
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,855
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

43
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,846
<font color="yellow">You were that hungry?</font>

44
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:55,911
<font color="yellow">- Take your jacket off.
- Should I?</font>

45
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,831
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

46
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:05,784
<font color="yellow">What is that flower petal?</font>

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,358
<font color="yellow"><i>I wanted to do this when
I met a person I really love.</i></font>

48
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,229
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,717
<font color="yellow">I was at a wedding, I guess it
got on me there, it's nothing.</font>

50
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,808
<font color="yellow">It's on your neck, too.</font>

51
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:26,223
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

52
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,213
<font color="yellow">It's inside your shirt, too.</font>

53
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,384
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

54
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:42,763
<font color="yellow">This kid...</font>

55
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:45,461
<font color="yellow">He asked me to move the flowers,
so I helped him.</font>

56
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,295
<font color="yellow">They must have gotten on me then.</font>

57
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,450
<font color="yellow">Darn petals...</font>

58
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:55,383
<font color="yellow">Honey, can I get more rice?</font>

59
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:56,606
<font color="yellow">I'm so hungry.</font>

60
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:22,334
<font color="yellow"><i>My wife is demanding
that we separate now.</i></font>

61
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:38,358
<font color="yellow"><i>She got mad that I told the
cheater's husband the truth.</i></font>

62
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:41,620
<font color="yellow"><i>She's more concerned about him than me.</i></font>

63
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:47,026
<font color="yellow"><i>Does my wife really
want to end things with me?</i></font>

64
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,923
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

65
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,190
<font color="yellow">It's you again?</font>

66
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:07,495
<font color="yellow">You don't go home?</font>

67
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,644
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

68
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,024
<font color="yellow">This is your spot?</font>

69
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:22,072
<font color="yellow">Your first time sleeping at the office?</font>

70
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,660
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

71
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,795
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

72
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:31,333
<font color="yellow">You can sleep here.</font>

73
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,697
<font color="yellow">You should put four chairs together...</font>

74
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:37,386
<font color="yellow">No, you're a head taller...</font>

75
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:40,673
<font color="yellow">Do as you want, five or six...</font>

76
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:45,740
<font color="yellow">Let's see if we have it...</font>

77
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,802
<font color="yellow">You're in luck today, Producer Do.</font>

78
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,336
<font color="yellow">Take good care of this.</font>

79
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:52,752
<font color="yellow">If you lose it, you'll have to
sleep covered in newspapers.</font>

80
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,677
<font color="yellow">- Follow me.
- Thank you.</font>

81
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,625
<font color="yellow"><i>- Separating?
- Yeah.</i></font>

82
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,593
<font color="yellow"><i>They're living apart
without getting a divorce.</i></font>

83
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:15,473
<font color="yellow"><i>- How is that different from a divorce?
- She'll continue to meet him?</i></font>

84
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:17,908
<font color="yellow"><i>She can't bring up the divorce,
so that's why she's doing this.</i></font>

85
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:22,334
<font color="yellow"><i>- He's more important than you?
- You should go beat him up.</i></font>

86
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:23,334
<font color="yellow"><i>Game over.</i></font>

87
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:24,882
<font color="yellow"><i>What's your size?</i></font>

88
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:28,095
<font color="yellow"><i>If you tell me,
I'll get your coffin ready.</i></font>

89
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,182
<font color="yellow"><i>Come to Han River.</i></font>

90
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:32,005
<font color="yellow"><i>That bastard always tells
you to come, but he's still alive.</i></font>

91
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,874
<font color="yellow"><i>She dumped you? LOL</i></font>

92
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,072
<font color="yellow">How can they be so insensitive?</font>

93
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:42,336
<font color="yellow">Your lives aren't much better, jerks.</font>

94
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,473
<font color="yellow">It's so cold.</font>

95
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,271
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

96
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,173
<font color="yellow">That's water to wash your face.</font>

97
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:09,927
<font color="yellow">There's no hot water,
just wash the important parts.</font>

98
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:14,040
<font color="yellow">Is she really a woman?</font>

99
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,314
<font color="yellow">This will control the grease.</font>

100
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,353
<font color="yellow">Nobody will be able to tell.</font>

101
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:26,002
<font color="yellow">One wet tissue is enough
for one day, right?</font>

102
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,259
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

103
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,255
<font color="yellow">Damn.</font>

104
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,636
<font color="yellow">So depressing.</font>

105
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:40,023
<font color="yellow">Why does this place
feel like a homeless shelter?</font>

106
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,901
<font color="yellow">You said you're separating,
but why did you leave?</font>

107
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,237
<font color="yellow">How did you know we are separating?</font>

108
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:51,086
<font color="yellow">You wrote it all over the internet.</font>

109
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,305
<font color="yellow">I told her I would leave.</font>

110
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,146
<font color="yellow">What can I do when she
says she'll leave with Joon Soo?</font>

111
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,971
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Joon Soo is the victim here.</font>

112
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:03,471
<font color="yellow">Then where are you going
to stay from now on?</font>

113
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,824
<font color="yellow">I'll have to come to the office,
or go to a spa or a motel.</font>

114
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:09,497
<font color="yellow">Are you a runaway teen?</font>

115
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,923
<font color="yellow">If you run into people,
what will they think?</font>

116
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:15,572
<font color="yellow">Stop acting pitiful, and come to my...</font>

117
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,658
<font color="yellow">- No, you can't come to my house...
- I won't go there, don't worry.</font>

118
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:22,737
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't dare go there,
and deal with your wife.</font>

119
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,980
<font color="yellow">Yeah...</font>

120
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:29,142
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

121
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,906
<font color="yellow">You're posting pictures of
food on your social media?</font>

122
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:34,208
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Honey?</font>

123
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,438
<font color="yellow">- He's pretty slick looking.
- Not bad.</font>

124
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:41,032
<font color="yellow">You want to introduce him
to your sister?</font>

125
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:43,249
<font color="yellow">Yeah, she should get married soon.</font>

126
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:45,957
<font color="yellow">No, the flower arrangement instructor.</font>

127
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:50,125
<font color="yellow">I don't think she's dating anyone.</font>

128
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:54,802
<font color="yellow">Men like that type, no?</font>

129
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:58,413
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

130
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:04,687
<font color="yellow">What man would like her?</font>

131
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:07,167
<font color="yellow">I really don't like her.</font>

132
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:35,849
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's up?</font>

133
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:38,246
<font color="yellow">Ah Ra wants to know
what you're doing for lunch.</font>

134
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:40,408
<font color="yellow">Tell her I'll take care of it.</font>

135
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,703
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

136
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:54,211
<font color="yellow">It's kind of thrilling
having someone watch over me.</font>

137
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,345
<font color="yellow">It's kind of nice.</font>

138
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,721
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

139
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:02,745
<font color="yellow">Wait, the CD...</font>

140
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:06,013
<font color="yellow"><i>Is she kidding?
You should show her what's up.</i></font>

141
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,533
<font color="yellow"><i>Sue her!</i></font>

142
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,311
<font color="yellow"><i>Serves you right.</i></font>

143
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:13,269
<font color="yellow"><i>You rat your wife out, but you
can't even make ramen on your own.</i></font>

144
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,793
<font color="yellow">Hey, you don't even say hi to me?</font>

145
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,565
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Oh!</font>

146
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:38,024
<font color="yellow"><i>If it's come this far, it may be
better to separate for the kid's sake.</i></font>

147
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:43,222
<font color="yellow">They can't live like that.
They need to separate.</font>

148
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,634
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, you can't do this here.</font>

149
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:58,120
<font color="yellow">It's so dry here.</font>

150
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,625
<font color="yellow">I have really sensitive skin.</font>

151
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:06,510
<font color="yellow">You think this is your bedroom?
What the heck are you doing?</font>

152
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,032
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of her,
you can go back to your business.</font>

153
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,427
<font color="yellow">- You're not eating lunch?
- We don't need to eat...</font>

154
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,841
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat.</font>

155
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:20,602
<font color="yellow">Go where?</font>

156
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:23,200
<font color="yellow">I packed something light for us to eat.</font>

157
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,384
<font color="yellow">Granny, you can't do this here.</font>

158
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:34,772
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

159
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,061
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

160
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,302
<font color="yellow">He's so rude.</font>

161
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:41,311
<font color="yellow">You jerks, we're never going back there!</font>

162
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:44,869
<font color="yellow">What do we do?
It was getting really fun.</font>

163
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:49,910
<font color="yellow">Can we buy a smartphone?
We can view it at home then.</font>

164
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,649
<font color="yellow">Where do we have the money?
Go ahead and sell the land then!</font>

165
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,801
<font color="yellow">If I could sell it,
I would have sold it already.</font>

166
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:56,936
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

167
00:11:58,438 --> 00:11:59,684
<font color="yellow">Bitch.</font>

168
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:01,317
<font color="yellow"><i>Then your wife packed up and left?</i></font>

169
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,644
<font color="yellow"><i>It's possible that
Toycrane got kicked out.</i></font>

170
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:05,926
<font color="yellow"><i>- No way.
- That would be ----.</i></font>

171
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,289
<font color="yellow"><i>You're giving all men
a bad name, you loser.</i></font>

172
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:11,192
<font color="yellow">But I have a kid.</font>

173
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,783
<font color="yellow">- Producer Do, you have the preview.
- Yeah.</font>

174
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,216
<font color="yellow">- What are you looking at?
- It's nothing.</font>

175
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:17,894
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

176
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:18,956
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

177
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:36,941
<font color="yellow">- Time?
- 54 minutes 38 seconds.</font>

178
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,556
<font color="yellow">- About a minute and a half too long.
- We're not done editing.</font>

179
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,277
<font color="yellow">- Tell us what to cut.
- Okay.</font>

180
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:47,594
<font color="yellow">We need to start the audio a little
earlier, it doesn't match the picture.</font>

181
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:50,784
<font color="yellow">If you see something, tell us.</font>

182
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:52,206
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

183
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:55,274
<font color="yellow"><i>You got fired before making it to
manager, and you're home now.</i></font>

184
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,620
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah, I stayed home...</i></font>

185
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,990
<font color="yellow">- Don't we need more captions?
- No, too much is not good.</font>

186
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,168
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

187
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:07,589
<font color="yellow"><i>You must be working out,
your butt looks great.</i></font>

188
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,977
<font color="yellow">Edit that out.</font>

189
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:11,783
<font color="yellow">We're going to blur it out anyway.</font>

190
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:14,167
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about her face,
the whole scene.</font>

191
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:17,407
<font color="yellow">Why?
This isn't bad.</font>

192
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,652
<font color="yellow">No, I bet people will
make an issue out of it.</font>

193
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:23,186
<font color="yellow">Get rid of all the
talking in the back, too.</font>

194
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,403
<font color="yellow">It came out nice.</font>

195
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:30,818
<font color="yellow">It'll be a hit, good job.</font>

196
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:33,996
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you realize we worked hard.</font>

197
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,177
<font color="yellow">Punk, what's wrong with you?</font>

198
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,529
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, I know
you worked hard on this.</font>

199
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,135
<font color="yellow">- You were living there.
- No...</font>

200
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:45,639
<font color="yellow">That's her style, she even likes
watching movies in the office.</font>

201
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,216
<font color="yellow">Are you allergic to your home,
or something?</font>

202
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:51,825
<font color="yellow">This tea is very hot.</font>

203
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:54,447
<font color="yellow">If you get it on your face,
you'll get a nice burn.</font>

204
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,799
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you so glum?</font>

205
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,818
<font color="yellow">You're nervous about the first airing?</font>

206
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:03,192
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

207
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,534
<font color="yellow">- Pour it on him, it's okay.
- Really?</font>

208
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:08,998
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

209
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,246
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

210
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:12,197
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello?</i></font>

211
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:15,924
<font color="yellow"><i>Is this Mr. Do Hyun Woo's cellphone?</i></font>

212
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,602
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

213
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:21,778
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm Mr. Ji Sun Woo's wife.</i></font>

214
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,644
<font color="yellow">At lunch time?</font>

215
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,889
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah, we haven't been
able to see each other.</i></font>

216
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:29,005
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll go by your office.</i></font>

217
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,565
<font color="yellow">No, I'll go to you.</font>

218
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:34,145
<font color="yellow">My baby must have missed me a lot.</font>

219
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,436
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

220
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:38,842
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll get there on time.</font>

221
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:42,317
<font color="yellow">You have a guest.</font>

222
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:43,788
<font color="yellow">Tell her to come in.</font>

223
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,735
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

224
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,831
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello.</font>

225
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,128
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

226
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:09,176
<font color="yellow">I think my husband is having an affair.</font>

227
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:11,663
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

228
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:13,682
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I mean...</font>

229
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:14,942
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you came.</font>

230
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:20,789
<font color="yellow">It's advantageous to file for divorce
when your husband is being unfaithful.</font>

231
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:24,495
<font color="yellow">Should we start the consultation?</font>

232
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:26,371
<font color="yellow">Do you have any proof?</font>

233
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:29,136
<font color="yellow">He did have a conversation
with her on social media.</font>

234
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,706
<font color="yellow">Social media...</font>

235
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:33,568
<font color="yellow">Can you show me?</font>

236
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:38,730
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

237
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,330
<font color="yellow">I'll go next to you.</font>

238
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,568
<font color="yellow">Social media...</font>

239
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:49,019
<font color="yellow"><i>- You're so cool, Director.
- Thanks, Sun Young.</i></font>

240
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,561
<font color="yellow">Looking at this as a professional...</font>

241
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,630
<font color="yellow">- Their relationship is very serious.
- Pardon?</font>

242
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,397
<font color="yellow">I just requested to be your friend.</font>

243
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,927
<font color="yellow">What perfume do you use?</font>

244
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:06,202
<font color="yellow">I'm not wearing any today.</font>

245
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:11,986
<font color="yellow">Oh, then it must be your natural scent.</font>

246
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:16,494
<font color="yellow">Doesn't Producer Do seem
very busy these days?</font>

247
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:19,212
<font color="yellow">Did his situation change?</font>

248
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:24,264
<font color="yellow">It did change, he left home
and he's separated from his wife.</font>

249
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,793
<font color="yellow">That's only possible because it's him.</font>

250
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:31,543
<font color="yellow">If it were you, you would
have kicked your wife out.</font>

251
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:34,975
<font color="yellow">And gotten both sets of parents
together to cause a scene.</font>

252
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:36,543
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

253
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:42,136
<font color="yellow">How can you be so sure of that?</font>

254
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:45,144
<font color="yellow">I've never treated you badly.</font>

255
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:48,192
<font color="yellow">- If anything, I took care of you.
- And how is that?</font>

256
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:52,611
<font color="yellow">When everyone was going out to
see cherry blossoms, you got all lonely</font>

257
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,839
<font color="yellow">and asked me to go eat
dinner with you, so I did...</font>

258
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,496
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you to dinner
because of the cherry blossoms.</font>

259
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:01,399
<font color="yellow">They just happened to
be blossoming then.</font>

260
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,342
<font color="yellow">- Same thing.
- No.</font>

261
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,455
<font color="yellow">Then what about the karaoke bar?</font>

262
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:10,358
<font color="yellow">You asked me to go to the karaoke
bar after dinner, so I went with you.</font>

263
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:13,829
<font color="yellow">- You don't remember that?
- You wanted to go drink.</font>

264
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,049
<font color="yellow">If we drink, I would have to
stay several hours with you.</font>

265
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:20,541
<font color="yellow">But if we go to a karaoke bar,
we can go home after an hour.</font>

266
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,410
<font color="yellow">Maybe you were the one feeling
lonely because of the cherry blossoms.</font>

267
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,803
<font color="yellow">Why would I?
I have a wife.</font>

268
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:31,595
<font color="yellow">Yeah, why are you looking at me
to take care of you then?</font>

269
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:34,182
<font color="yellow">No, I'm the one who took care of you.</font>

270
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,407
<font color="yellow">I thought of you alone in the office</font>

271
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,633
<font color="yellow">while everyone was out
enjoying the flowers.</font>

272
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:42,140
<font color="yellow">I felt so bad for you.</font>

273
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,154
<font color="yellow">Do you know who you
should really feel bad for?</font>

274
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:48,061
<font color="yellow">Your wife.</font>

275
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:52,476
<font color="yellow">- I'm about to tear up.
- You have to get the last word in?</font>

276
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,031
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Isn't that your wife?</font>

277
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:58,267
<font color="yellow">Your wife works here?</font>

278
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,630
<font color="yellow">No, my wife has short hair.</font>

279
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:05,692
<font color="yellow">She had long hair?</font>

280
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,609
<font color="yellow">You don't know?</font>

281
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:13,448
<font color="yellow">I mean, it's long.</font>

282
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:24,769
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for calling you
out of the blue.</font>

283
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,959
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

284
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:32,237
<font color="yellow">- It's my husband's fault...
- My wife is at fault, too.</font>

285
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,625
<font color="yellow">Let's skip the apologies.</font>

286
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,157
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

287
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,375
<font color="yellow">I was grateful that you told me.</font>

288
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,201
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I would never have found out.</font>

289
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:47,314
<font color="yellow">He was such a perfect
father and husband.</font>

290
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:51,286
<font color="yellow">My wife was a perfect
mother and wife, too.</font>

291
00:18:51,286 --> 00:18:53,827
<font color="yellow">Before she met your husband.</font>

292
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:56,631
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

293
00:18:56,631 --> 00:19:05,732
<font color="yellow">But this was an opportunity for us to
think deeply about our relationship.</font>

294
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:08,109
<font color="yellow">We were so busy raising two kids</font>

295
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:11,638
<font color="yellow">we never had time to think
about our relationship.</font>

296
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:15,704
<font color="yellow">I thought about why he had that affair.</font>

297
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,510
<font color="yellow">Why is that important?</font>

298
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,200
<font color="yellow">The fact that he cheated
is what's important.</font>

299
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,204
<font color="yellow">What he did is excusable?</font>

300
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:26,903
<font color="yellow">You're not mad that he
did this to you behind your back?</font>

301
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:32,238
<font color="yellow">- You're not mad?
- Yes, I was mad, too.</font>

302
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:37,230
<font color="yellow">No matter how much he apologized,
I couldn't forgive him.</font>

303
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,559
<font color="yellow">But when I realized that I don't
want to break up with him</font>

304
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,450
<font color="yellow">I could forgive him.</font>

305
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,202
<font color="yellow">Rather than getting up the
courage to break up with him</font>

306
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:53,704
<font color="yellow">I want to gather the courage
to understand and forgive him.</font>

307
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:01,352
<font color="yellow">Then what about you?</font>

308
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:07,233
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we won't make a rash
and emotional decision, either.</font>

309
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:12,554
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

310
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:17,317
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get going.</font>

311
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,796
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

312
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,259
<font color="yellow">It's a little expensive here,
are you okay with that?</font>

313
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:15,441
<font color="yellow">Yes, you got Joon Soo into the art
class, and you've been so helpful.</font>

314
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:19,094
<font color="yellow">- The space just became available.
- Yeah.</font>

315
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:23,383
<font color="yellow">- It's okay to leave during work hours?
- It's my lunch hour.</font>

316
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:27,009
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- Look how much weight you've lost.</font>

317
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:30,256
<font color="yellow">I'm so jealous, I keep
getting fatter and fatter.</font>

318
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:34,068
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be jealous.
That's because she's working so hard.</font>

319
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:37,884
<font color="yellow">Isn't Joon Soo's dad a producer?
You don't need to make money, no?</font>

320
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:39,971
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- I'm jealous, too.</font>

321
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:43,384
<font color="yellow">She gets to leave the house,
and check out other guys.</font>

322
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:49,821
<font color="yellow">But can you ask that camera man
to come back?</font>

323
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:53,509
<font color="yellow">- What?
- The one that came to our field day...</font>

324
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:55,992
<font color="yellow">- Yeah...
- Your husband sent him.</font>

325
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,704
<font color="yellow">- I think he was a video jockey.
- Yeah.</font>

326
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:01,339
<font color="yellow">I hope he can come to
our next school event.</font>

327
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:06,459
<font color="yellow">I was looking at the video from the
field day, and it looks so professional.</font>

328
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,213
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

329
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:10,519
<font color="yellow">If he can't come, it's okay.</font>

330
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,471
<font color="yellow">No, I'll ask my husband.</font>

331
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:14,999
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

332
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,486
<font color="yellow">That would be great.</font>

333
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:20,844
<font color="yellow">Then can I get tickets to go see
the filming of "Hidden Singer?"</font>

334
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,605
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

335
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:25,769
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll find out.</font>

336
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:27,522
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

337
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:36,330
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, did you finish the
work for Digital Site?</font>

338
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,257
<font color="yellow">I'll do it right now.</font>

339
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:41,452
<font color="yellow">Captain, I sent you Image Group's
project I've been working on...</font>

340
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:43,694
<font color="yellow">- Sorry, I'll get to it now.
- Okay.</font>

341
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,642
<font color="yellow"><i>She's willing to forgive him
when he cheated on her.</i></font>

342
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:53,520
<font color="yellow"><i>He's got some skills, I got kicked out
by my wife who cheated on me.</i></font>

343
00:22:58,104 --> 00:23:00,707
<font color="yellow">Ah Ra, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?</font>

344
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:02,623
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

345
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:07,163
<font color="yellow">But what brings you here again?
You can't get in contact with Yoon Ki?</font>

346
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:10,901
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're here.
This...</font>

347
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,346
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

348
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:16,061
<font color="yellow">I was packing his lunch,
and I brought some for everyone.</font>

349
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,941
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- Thank you.</font>

350
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:22,430
<font color="yellow">- I thought I would die of hunger.
- People will think I'm starving you.</font>

351
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,226
<font color="yellow">- Thanks.
- Open it up.</font>

352
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:27,163
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- It looks so good.</font>

353
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:29,273
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Thank you.</font>

354
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:32,303
<font color="yellow">- Is there enough?
- Don't worry about it.</font>

355
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:37,630
<font color="yellow">Here, would you like to eat this, too?</font>

356
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,028
<font color="yellow">I made it for Yoon Ki,
but he's not in the office.</font>

357
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,420
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

358
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,278
<font color="yellow">- This is awesome.
- Wow.</font>

359
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:47,173
<font color="yellow">- Then I'll get going.
- What?</font>

360
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:49,796
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy.
- Apples.</font>

361
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:52,431
<font color="yellow">- She's leaving.
- Thank you!</font>

362
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,041
<font color="yellow">Thanks!</font>

363
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,678
<font color="yellow">I thought Attorney Choi married her for
her looks, but she's a good cook, too.</font>

364
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:00,439
<font color="yellow">There must be something
about Attorney Choi.</font>

365
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,519
<font color="yellow">Even that flower....</font>

366
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:08,095
<font color="yellow">So that customer wanted
to return everything.</font>

367
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:09,471
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

368
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:12,192
<font color="yellow">She had bought it over a month ago.</font>

369
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:14,684
<font color="yellow">- But what are you doing?
- Huh?</font>

370
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,718
<font color="yellow">I'm working, go on.</font>

371
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,712
<font color="yellow">So I told her she can't do it.</font>

372
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:28,130
<font color="yellow">And she threw a complete fit,
saying she's going to write a review.</font>

373
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,674
<font color="yellow">She was saying I underestimated her.</font>

374
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:34,204
<font color="yellow">- How terrible.
- Yeah, she was the worst.</font>

375
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,580
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

376
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:40,856
<font color="yellow">It was such a hard day today.</font>

377
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,469
<font color="yellow">My baby...
My poor baby...</font>

378
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:48,741
<font color="yellow">- I'm so sorry, Baby...
- I feel so bad for myself.</font>

379
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:52,202
<font color="yellow">- I'll protect you now.
- Okay.</font>

380
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,814
<font color="yellow">Hold me tight.</font>

381
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:00,417
<font color="yellow">Almost done.</font>

382
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,792
<font color="yellow">I hope it gets a lot of views.</font>

383
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,395
<font color="yellow">- We need a high rating.
- Yeah.</font>

384
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,894
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

385
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:11,586
<font color="yellow">- You have a man?
- What are you saying?</font>

386
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:14,434
<font color="yellow">He's the one I recently
contacted for our new case.</font>

387
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:17,576
<font color="yellow">I met him at the interview, and
he's been calling me ever since.</font>

388
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:20,354
<font color="yellow">He keeps saying he gets so mad...</font>

389
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:23,981
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's mad.
His wife cheated on him.</font>

390
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,750
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm sure he's mad.</font>

391
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,007
<font color="yellow">But I heard that he even
had a child outside the marriage.</font>

392
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:36,542
<font color="yellow">He doesn't think about his wrongdoings.</font>

393
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,989
<font color="yellow">Men are different from women.</font>

394
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:43,020
<font color="yellow">It's male instinct to go breed.</font>

395
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,237
<font color="yellow">Damn instinct...</font>

396
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:47,728
<font color="yellow">You can't even control your
own instinctive urges?</font>

397
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:50,612
<font color="yellow">If you can't control yourself,
you're no more than an animal.</font>

398
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:54,185
<font color="yellow">If you can't control yourself,
you should go live in a zoo.</font>

399
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,258
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with men?</font>

400
00:25:56,258 --> 00:26:02,182
<font color="yellow">- Then why did you get married?
- That's enough.</font>

401
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:03,769
<font color="yellow">Because I was bad at math.</font>

402
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,482
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

403
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:10,146
<font color="yellow">I couldn't calculate beforehand whether
I would be able to live well with him.</font>

404
00:26:10,146 --> 00:26:13,451
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm also bad at foreign language.</font>

405
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:16,048
<font color="yellow">I couldn't understand
anything my husband was saying.</font>

406
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:19,401
<font color="yellow">And I'm sure my language was
foreign to him, too.</font>

407
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:24,140
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't assume that all
marriages are like that.</font>

408
00:26:24,442 --> 00:26:29,560
<font color="yellow">You can meet a man that doesn't require
any math or foreign language skills.</font>

409
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:34,259
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to get remarried.</font>

410
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,847
<font color="yellow">I may be bad at math
and foreign language</font>

411
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,993
<font color="yellow">but I'm good at recognizing
wrong answers.</font>

412
00:26:40,993 --> 00:26:44,032
<font color="yellow">I never get the same
problem wrong twice.</font>

413
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:47,746
<font color="yellow">Since the two of you are very smart</font>

414
00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:51,449
<font color="yellow">you won't have to worry about
doing poorly on the exam like me.</font>

415
00:26:56,155 --> 00:27:02,181
<font color="yellow">You have to admit,
women forgive men who cheat.</font>

416
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:05,031
<font color="yellow">So why is it that men
can't forgive women?</font>

417
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:08,200
<font color="yellow">- Tell me, Producer Do.
- Stop that.</font>

418
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,296
<font color="yellow">I'll take you home,
what's your unit number?</font>

419
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:13,382
<font color="yellow">You can't come to my house.</font>

420
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:18,007
<font color="yellow">- Then, I'll get going.
- Yeah, go.</font>

421
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:22,093
<font color="yellow">- Bye!
- Okay, see you tomorrow.</font>

422
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:23,772
<font color="yellow">- Hey, hey...
- She drank too much.</font>

423
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,135
<font color="yellow">- Where...
- Hey, hey!</font>

424
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:27,765
<font color="yellow">- You...
- Hey, hey.</font>

425
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:29,977
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Look at her...</font>

426
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,742
<font color="yellow">Holy--</font>

427
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:35,640
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with you?
- Producer Do.</font>

428
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,510
<font color="yellow">Why did you take off your wedding band?</font>

429
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,505
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Where's your ring?</font>

430
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:45,032
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- If you take off your wedding band</font>

431
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,223
<font color="yellow">you'll lose your wife.</font>

432
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:48,799
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

433
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,798
<font color="yellow">Do you know why you wear
your wedding band on this finger?</font>

434
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:55,806
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Do you know?</font>

435
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,494
<font color="yellow">I won't tell you.</font>

436
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:10,162
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

437
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:11,778
<font color="yellow">Please get up.</font>

438
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:13,578
<font color="yellow">I'm so embarrassed, get up!</font>

439
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:15,682
<font color="yellow">Come on, get up!</font>

440
00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:17,299
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon!</font>

441
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,530
<font color="yellow">Oh my--</font>

442
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,220
<font color="yellow">You keep scaring me.</font>

443
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,930
<font color="yellow">I must be crazy.</font>

444
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,704
<font color="yellow">I must really be crazy.</font>

445
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,334
<font color="yellow">- This is insane.
- What are you doing?</font>

446
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:28,036
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking your socks off?</font>

447
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:30,390
<font color="yellow">- Hey...
- Wash it.</font>

448
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,587
<font color="yellow">Why did she take her socks off?</font>

449
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:39,553
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking these off?</font>

450
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:47,365
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on.
Get up.</font>

451
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:51,092
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

452
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:55,338
<font color="yellow">I'm going in.</font>

453
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:21,357
<font color="yellow">Having an affair is perfect
when you're bored.</font>

454
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:38,616
<font color="yellow">Damn...</font>

455
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,498
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me?</font>

456
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:51,284
<font color="yellow">Your legs are so strong,
you should have been a soccer player.</font>

457
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:54,973
<font color="yellow">Wait until tomorrow...</font>

458
00:29:58,414 --> 00:30:01,540
<font color="yellow">Wait until tomorrow.</font>

459
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:07,351
<font color="yellow">Can I get a room?</font>

460
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:09,458
<font color="yellow">You're alone?</font>

461
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,088
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

462
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:15,180
<font color="yellow">Then we can't give you a room.</font>

463
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,222
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

464
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:21,883
<font color="yellow">There are so many people
doing the bad deed these days.</font>

465
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:25,289
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean?
- So you have a hard life.</font>

466
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:28,119
<font color="yellow">Why come here and
make my life hard, too?</font>

467
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,452
<font color="yellow">I'm not alone, she'll be here soon.</font>

468
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,202
<font color="yellow"><i>[Wifey]</i></font>

469
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:39,314
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

470
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:41,259
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you finish work?</i></font>

471
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:42,813
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

472
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:45,218
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry for saying this to you.</i></font>

473
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,050
<font color="yellow">It's okay, what is it?</font>

474
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,929
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

475
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,718
<font color="yellow"><i>That VJ you sent to
Joon Soo's field day...</i></font>

476
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:57,176
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you think you can send him again?</i></font>

477
00:30:57,176 --> 00:30:58,949
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

478
00:30:58,949 --> 00:31:01,267
<font color="yellow"><i>We're having an event
at Joon Soo's school.</i></font>

479
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:03,394
<font color="yellow">Hey, that...</font>

480
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,303
<font color="yellow">Forget it.
I'm busy.</font>

481
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:09,123
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

482
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:16,678
<font color="yellow">She doesn't care about
how I'm doing at all?</font>

483
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:20,259
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

484
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,568
<font color="yellow">Yeah, hurry and come.</font>

485
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:31,528
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

486
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:35,896
<font color="yellow">She's coming now.</font>

487
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,558
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

488
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:52,231
<font color="yellow">- Is there anything you need?
- No.</font>

489
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,328
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

490
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:58,583
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

491
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:04,191
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

492
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:06,558
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Try this rice cake.</font>

493
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,967
<font color="yellow">- It's from a grand opening...
- No, it's okay.</font>

494
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:12,263
<font color="yellow">- I don't like rice cakes.
- You should try it.</font>

495
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,412
<font color="yellow">- No, thank you.
- Rest then.</font>

496
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:16,401
<font color="yellow">- Get in.
- Okay.</font>

497
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,198
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

498
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:21,260
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

499
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:26,894
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, what is it now?
- The toilet is working okay?</font>

500
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:30,213
<font color="yellow">Somebody pooped a huge
thing like this yesterday...</font>

501
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:32,384
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness, is the TV working?</font>

502
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,163
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to watch TV!
Why are you doing this?</font>

503
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,442
<font color="yellow">Can you please just get out!</font>

504
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:40,244
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried you'll
have other thoughts.</font>

505
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:42,924
<font color="yellow">Just recently, right here...</font>

506
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:45,125
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

507
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:49,826
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
Sleep well.</font>

508
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:53,170
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this room?
Lady, lady!</font>

509
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:57,063
<font color="yellow">Lady!</font>

510
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:58,940
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

511
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:15,882
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

512
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:32,813
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

513
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:35,836
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you came?</font>

514
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:38,451
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

515
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,962
<font color="yellow">You must be very busy.
You didn't eat yet, right?</font>

516
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:44,832
<font color="yellow">- I had a lot of work to finish.
- It's okay.</font>

517
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:46,895
<font color="yellow">The one with free time
should pick him up.</font>

518
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:49,434
<font color="yellow">It's not hard picking up
my own grandson.</font>

519
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:52,987
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo went to sleep
early right after dinner.</font>

520
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:56,387
<font color="yellow">He was talking about all the
fun he had in gym class.</font>

521
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:00,948
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Mother.
- It's okay.</font>

522
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:02,323
<font color="yellow">What about Hyun Soo?</font>

523
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,621
<font color="yellow">He left.</font>

524
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,028
<font color="yellow">He's not coming in?</font>

525
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:14,186
<font color="yellow">He didn't do anything
right, why did he leave?</font>

526
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:17,427
<font color="yellow">Jerk...</font>

527
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:20,561
<font color="yellow">Hey, just tell him to
live on the streets.</font>

528
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:24,376
<font color="yellow">How dare he?
He should be begging you.</font>

529
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,414
<font color="yellow">No, Mother.</font>

530
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,172
<font color="yellow">He's not the one at fault.</font>

531
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:41,675
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

532
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,931
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who had the affair.</font>

533
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,456
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother.</font>

534
00:34:57,427 --> 00:35:00,652
<font color="yellow"><i>Toycrane's wife is so lucky.</i></font>

535
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:01,978
<font color="yellow"><i>She's finally free!</i></font>

536
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:05,387
<font color="yellow"><i>- I bet he's at a spa or a motel.
- Not even.</i></font>

537
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:08,230
<font color="yellow"><i>I bet he's on a swing at the playground.</i></font>

538
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:13,668
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

539
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:16,085
<font color="yellow">What took you so long?</font>

540
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:18,465
<font color="yellow">I was sleeping.</font>

541
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,547
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

542
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:21,836
<font color="yellow">You said you would sleep at a motel.</font>

543
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,121
<font color="yellow">I didn't feel like staying there.</font>

544
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,652
<font color="yellow">- Let's drink more.
- We have work tomorrow.</font>

545
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:29,820
<font color="yellow">- It's past two right now.
- Fine, punk.</font>

546
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,717
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

547
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:33,800
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

548
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,637
<font color="yellow">I'll just sleep here in the sand.</font>

549
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:39,715
<font color="yellow">It's fine, I'll just get
some sand in my mouth.</font>

550
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:43,032
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Soo...
- Hey, it's okay.</font>

551
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:47,521
<font color="yellow">I can't go to your house like this,
your wife would hate me.</font>

552
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,291
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

553
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,163
<font color="yellow">I'll just hang out alone here.</font>

554
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,364
<font color="yellow">Wow, I haven't been on a
swing in awhile, this is so fun.</font>

555
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:00,951
<font color="yellow">It's like the Viking ride.</font>

556
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:11,076
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you coming?</font>

557
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,914
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

558
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:16,119
<font color="yellow">What about your wife?</font>

559
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,472
<font color="yellow">You told her?</font>

560
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:20,516
<font color="yellow">She's not home.</font>

561
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:22,398
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

562
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:25,315
<font color="yellow">She went on a business trip?</font>

563
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:28,920
<font color="yellow">You should have told
me sooner then, punk!</font>

564
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,998
<font color="yellow">I thought I would freeze to death!</font>

565
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:33,463
<font color="yellow">Your house is so nice.</font>

566
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,860
<font color="yellow">It's simple, and so nice.</font>

567
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:41,568
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's because you don't have a kid.</font>

568
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:46,166
<font color="yellow">Hey, this is the first time I've come
to your house after you got married.</font>

569
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:49,240
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it, you never
even had a housewarming.</font>

570
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,844
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

571
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:56,012
<font color="yellow">Your house used to be
so dirty when you lived alone.</font>

572
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:58,693
<font color="yellow">Your wife must be very clean.</font>

573
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:03,186
<font color="yellow">- I'll go buy some beer.
- Yeah, let's just have one more drink.</font>

574
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,297
<font color="yellow">Where's the bathroom?</font>

575
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:06,769
<font color="yellow">By the entrance.</font>

576
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:12,123
<font color="yellow">The house is so nice!</font>

577
00:37:20,242 --> 00:37:23,639
<font color="yellow">I should have told him
to buy a toothbrush.</font>

578
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,059
<font color="yellow">But why is there only one toothbrush?</font>

579
00:37:31,454 --> 00:37:34,148
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

580
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:36,873
<font color="yellow">She doesn't cook?</font>

581
00:38:00,673 --> 00:38:02,503
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

582
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:04,496
<font color="yellow">It looks like he lives all alone.</font>

583
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:08,487
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

584
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:12,311
<font color="yellow">- When did you come?
- Why are you so shocked?</font>

585
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:13,976
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

586
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:18,188
<font color="yellow">It looks like you live
alone here without your wife.</font>

587
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:21,878
<font color="yellow">I told you, she's not home.</font>

588
00:38:21,878 --> 00:38:23,876
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

589
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,878
<font color="yellow">- You told your wife?
- She's not home.</font>

590
00:38:47,297 --> 00:38:49,074
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Soo.
- Yeah?</font>

591
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:52,101
<font color="yellow">I'm going to use the bathroom.</font>

592
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:54,387
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

593
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:56,824
<font color="yellow">This is your house.</font>

594
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:23,445
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

595
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:25,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

596
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,297
<font color="yellow">Your wife left home?</font>

597
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:29,697
<font color="yellow">Three days after you came back
from your honeymoon?</font>

598
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:33,585
<font color="yellow">So you've been living alone
for three years like this?</font>

599
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:36,666
<font color="yellow">Then when you said she's not home</font>

600
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,168
<font color="yellow">you meant permanently?</font>

601
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:41,362
<font color="yellow">I told you several times,
but you didn't catch on.</font>

602
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:42,744
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

603
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:44,592
<font color="yellow">What the heck...</font>

604
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,679
<font color="yellow">Why did she do that?
Did you ask her?</font>

605
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:53,686
<font color="yellow">I was curious myself, so I
looked everywhere for her.</font>

606
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:57,487
<font color="yellow">But when I found her, I didn't
see the point of asking her.</font>

607
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,101
<font color="yellow">It's all over anyway.</font>

608
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,456
<font color="yellow">She must have hated me,
she didn't even last a week.</font>

609
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:06,523
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?
You should have told me.</font>

610
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:07,983
<font color="yellow">I was embarrassed.</font>

611
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:14,644
<font color="yellow">Everybody was asking me
how the honeymoon was.</font>

612
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:17,318
<font color="yellow">I was too embarrassed to tell them
that my wife ran away.</font>

613
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,682
<font color="yellow">That's why I acted like
I was still married.</font>

614
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,166
<font color="yellow">And I missed the right timing.</font>

615
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:26,081
<font color="yellow">It's fine, forget that woman.</font>

616
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,572
<font color="yellow">Forget her, and start over.</font>

617
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:32,786
<font color="yellow">You don't lack anything,
and you're still young.</font>

618
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:36,807
<font color="yellow">You can meet a better woman,
and have a better life.</font>

619
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:41,170
<font color="yellow">I don't know...</font>

620
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,563
<font color="yellow">After that, I'm afraid to meet women.
I don't want to be humiliated anymore.</font>

621
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:51,789
<font color="yellow">You and I have such bad luck with women.</font>

622
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:07,235
<font color="yellow">You've never seen me drink before?</font>

623
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:10,719
<font color="yellow">No, it's not the first time...</font>

624
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:14,239
<font color="yellow">But you've never seen me
drink like this, right?</font>

625
00:41:14,824 --> 00:41:20,003
<font color="yellow">I drink better than your father-in-law.</font>

626
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:25,414
<font color="yellow">I just didn't drink because I didn't
want people thinking I'm a bad mom.</font>

627
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:41,083
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo wants to divorce you
because you had the affair?</font>

628
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,277
<font color="yellow">We didn't get to really talk, yet.</font>

629
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:50,016
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

630
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,181
<font color="yellow">You want to get divorced?</font>

631
00:42:03,643 --> 00:42:08,284
<font color="yellow">Woman can have affairs, too.</font>

632
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:11,327
<font color="yellow">We are people, too.</font>

633
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:16,273
<font color="yellow">Even if we just stay home cleaning,
cooking, and doing laundry...</font>

634
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:17,856
<font color="yellow">we are still women.</font>

635
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:22,876
<font color="yellow">It's only natural
that we get drawn to people</font>

636
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:29,902
<font color="yellow">who treat us well
and make us feel loved.</font>

637
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:36,012
<font color="yellow">But a mother shouldn't do that.</font>

638
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:40,704
<font color="yellow">If your husband does something wrong,
you can kick him to the curb.</font>

639
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:43,009
<font color="yellow">But Joon Soo didn't do anything wrong.</font>

640
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:54,715
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for Hyun Woo
and Hyun Soo in the U.S.</font>

641
00:42:54,715 --> 00:42:58,092
<font color="yellow">I would have gotten
a divorce 40 years earlier.</font>

642
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:01,625
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it now</font>

643
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:06,711
<font color="yellow">it's because I stayed married that
I have two sons that take my side.</font>

644
00:43:11,275 --> 00:43:16,666
<font color="yellow">I was sick of marriage, too.</font>

645
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,686
<font color="yellow">It stunk.</font>

646
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,382
<font color="yellow">Even if we do get a divorce</font>

647
00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:33,126
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make the
best decision for Joon Soo.</font>

648
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:35,688
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

649
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:39,518
<font color="yellow">I know what a good
mother you are to him.</font>

650
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:53,155
<font color="yellow">When Joon Soo was an infant,
you must have run home from work.</font>

651
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:59,280
<font color="yellow">It was the middle of winter,
but you were wet with sweat.</font>

652
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,541
<font color="yellow">You were holding Joon Soo, and I saw
that your toes were bruised black.</font>

653
00:44:05,925 --> 00:44:11,266
<font color="yellow">If your mother had seen that,
she would have cried.</font>

654
00:44:22,646 --> 00:44:24,226
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

655
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:27,007
<font color="yellow">My baby, you woke up?</font>

656
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,001
<font color="yellow">Why did you wake up?</font>

657
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,969
<font color="yellow">Where's Dad?</font>

658
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,798
<font color="yellow">He will be home soon.</font>

659
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,469
<font color="yellow">He will be home.</font>

660
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:52,657
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're still better off than me.</font>

661
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:55,831
<font color="yellow">I got stabbed in the back after
eight years of living together.</font>

662
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:57,989
<font color="yellow">It's total betrayal.</font>

663
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,764
<font color="yellow">I dated her for eight years, too.</font>

664
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:09,150
<font color="yellow">Eight years of marriage, and six
years of dating is fourteen years.</font>

665
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,579
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

666
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,753
<font color="yellow">I put everything online,
and made a fool of myself.</font>

667
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,538
<font color="yellow">Even little kids think I'm a joke.</font>

668
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:18,393
<font color="yellow">What about me then?</font>

669
00:45:18,393 --> 00:45:20,835
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to get caught
that I'm living alone</font>

670
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:26,434
<font color="yellow">so I saved the package carrier's
phone number as my wife's number.</font>

671
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,465
<font color="yellow">Every time I get a call
from him, I get surprised.</font>

672
00:45:28,465 --> 00:45:30,534
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

673
00:45:30,534 --> 00:45:33,398
<font color="yellow">I talk to myself when I'm home.</font>

674
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,635
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'll be back.</font>

675
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:38,467
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'm home!</font>

676
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:42,829
<font color="yellow">Do you know how pathetic I feel?</font>

677
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:47,865
<font color="yellow">And every anniversary,
I buy a cake for myself.</font>

678
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:51,481
<font color="yellow">And a greeting card and a present, too.</font>

679
00:45:53,143 --> 00:46:01,780
<font color="yellow">Hey, did your wife go cheat on you
the day after your anniversary?</font>

680
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:05,963
<font color="yellow">At least you got to live with her.</font>

681
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:10,599
<font color="yellow">Did you ever live alone like me?</font>

682
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:13,733
<font color="yellow">Why did this happen to me?</font>

683
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:18,242
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid to meet another woman.</font>

684
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:25,525
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

685
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:41,014
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with us?</font>

686
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:51,943
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

687
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:56,414
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your eyes?</font>

688
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:57,945
<font color="yellow">Is it allergies?</font>

689
00:46:57,945 --> 00:46:59,528
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

690
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:00,797
<font color="yellow">Everyone's here early.</font>

691
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:04,188
<font color="yellow">We have good feedback
for the preview we uploaded.</font>

692
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,806
<font color="yellow">- We have so many likes.
- I have a good feeling about it.</font>

693
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:11,855
<font color="yellow">Of course, we worked on it.</font>

694
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:18,673
<font color="yellow"><i>[Wifey]</i></font>

695
00:47:29,251 --> 00:47:32,469
<font color="yellow">This is yours, right?</font>

696
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:35,429
<font color="yellow">Oh, you had this?</font>

697
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:38,806
<font color="yellow">You didn't wash it?</font>

698
00:47:38,806 --> 00:47:40,980
<font color="yellow">Why was that at my house?</font>

699
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,628
<font color="yellow">That's because I took
it off at your house.</font>

700
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,983
<font color="yellow">So why is this at my house?</font>

701
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:52,608
<font color="yellow">- Did you?
- Did I what?</font>

702
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:58,909
<font color="yellow">Oh, nothing you were
hoping for happened...</font>

703
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,184
<font color="yellow">I was hoping for what?</font>

704
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:04,030
<font color="yellow">Why were you in my house?
And why did you take your socks off?</font>

705
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,706
<font color="yellow">- Are you a pervert?
- Pervert?</font>

706
00:48:06,547 --> 00:48:07,931
<font color="yellow">Wow...</font>

707
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:10,679
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Writer Kwon.</font>

708
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,630
<font color="yellow">You were drunk off your butt, and
you fell on the street and fell asleep.</font>

709
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:21,184
<font color="yellow">Out of the kindness of my heart, I took
pity on you and brought you home.</font>

710
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:23,811
<font color="yellow">And these smelly socks here...</font>

711
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:29,199
<font color="yellow">While I was cleaning up all
the trash in front of your house</font>

712
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,333
<font color="yellow">your garbage bag ripped,
and all the content fell on my feet.</font>

713
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:36,266
<font color="yellow">That's why I took my
socks off for a little bit...</font>

714
00:48:36,695 --> 00:48:37,695
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

715
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:41,103
<font color="yellow">You don't recognize this
kimchi smell as your own?</font>

716
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:44,465
<font color="yellow">Why did you throw out my garbage?
You are so annoying.</font>

717
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:47,626
<font color="yellow">I did all that for you.</font>

718
00:48:47,626 --> 00:48:49,074
<font color="yellow">Fine, okay.</font>

719
00:48:49,074 --> 00:48:55,003
<font color="yellow">From now on, whether you are on the
streets swimming in dirt, or whatever...</font>

720
00:48:55,003 --> 00:48:57,541
<font color="yellow">I won't care at all,
so don't worry.</font>

721
00:48:57,541 --> 00:49:01,320
<font color="yellow">And I'll find all the garbage that
was in front of your door</font>

722
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,266
<font color="yellow">and I'll pile it up all nice
again, so just wait.</font>

723
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:08,347
<font color="yellow">I'll never help you again...</font>

724
00:49:08,347 --> 00:49:10,463
<font color="yellow">What the heck...</font>

725
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,159
<font color="yellow">I'm so annoyed!</font>

726
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:18,987
<font color="yellow">Why does she keep calling?</font>

727
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:20,706
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad!</i></font>

728
00:49:20,706 --> 00:49:22,208
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo!</font>

729
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,246
<font color="yellow"><i>Why didn't you pick up your phone?</i></font>

730
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:25,824
<font color="yellow"><i>Bad connection?</i></font>

731
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:28,541
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.
Have you been well?</font>

732
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,594
<font color="yellow">Where are you?
Did you eat breakfast?</font>

733
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:33,833
<font color="yellow"><i>Of course I ate.
It's already late.</i></font>

734
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,625
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm on my way to school with Mom.</i></font>

735
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,739
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

736
00:49:38,402 --> 00:49:40,559
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad, you'll be home tonight, right?</i></font>

737
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,043
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

738
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:44,972
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

739
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:47,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad is busy, hang up.</i></font>

740
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,675
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad, I'll put Mom on the phone.</i></font>

741
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:51,652
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Soo...
Don't put her on.</font>

742
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:53,128
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

743
00:49:53,128 --> 00:49:55,827
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello?</i></font>

744
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,150
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

745
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,949
<font color="yellow"><i>You're at work?</i></font>

746
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:01,862
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

747
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:07,666
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry, but that VJ
I asked about yesterday...</i></font>

748
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,927
<font color="yellow">He can't go, he's busy.</font>

749
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:13,583
<font color="yellow">He went as a special favor
for me last time.</font>

750
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:16,291
<font color="yellow">Tell them no, he can't come.</font>

751
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:19,710
<font color="yellow"><i>Can you just ask him once?</i></font>

752
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,820
<font color="yellow"><i>He'll taking Joon Soo's pictures, too...</i></font>

753
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,952
<font color="yellow">You have nothing more to say?
I'm hanging up.</font>

754
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:26,641
<font color="yellow"><i>Hold on.</i></font>

755
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:29,295
<font color="yellow"><i>Come home tonight.</i></font>

756
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:32,721
<font color="yellow">Why, so you can leave?</font>

757
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,161
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying
you'll leave with Joon Soo?</font>

758
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:39,393
<font color="yellow"><i>No, we can't stay like this forever.</i></font>

759
00:50:39,393 --> 00:50:40,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Come in, so we can talk.</i></font>

760
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,867
<font color="yellow">You're the one who
wanted to take time off.</font>

761
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:47,106
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah, I wasn't thinking right.
So come home...</i></font>

762
00:50:47,106 --> 00:50:48,601
<font color="yellow">Who are you to tell me what to do?</font>

763
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:52,909
<font color="yellow">That's my house. I'll go in
when I feel like it, got it?</font>

764
00:50:59,532 --> 00:51:02,043
<font color="yellow"><i>Give me food!</i></font>

765
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,518
<font color="yellow"><i>Give me food!</i></font>

766
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:07,155
<font color="yellow"><i>Give me food!</i></font>

767
00:51:25,985 --> 00:51:28,143
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

768
00:51:28,478 --> 00:51:30,949
<font color="yellow">That girl from yesterday is coming back?</font>

769
00:51:30,949 --> 00:51:33,744
<font color="yellow">Weren't you supposed to have
a meeting with Mr. Kim Pil Soo?</font>

770
00:51:33,744 --> 00:51:37,054
<font color="yellow">That case is almost closed.</font>

771
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:41,436
<font color="yellow">We need to take care
of the urgent cases first.</font>

772
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:44,362
<font color="yellow">- Yes, come in.
- Hello.</font>

773
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,570
<font color="yellow">Producer Lee Ji Hoon!</font>

774
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,132
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

775
00:51:49,132 --> 00:51:51,731
<font color="yellow">- Yes, hello.
- What are you doing here?</font>

776
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:53,612
<font color="yellow">We're going to watch
the first airing together.</font>

777
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,492
<font color="yellow">If you have time, you should come.</font>

778
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:59,235
<font color="yellow">Oh, I have an important
consultation, I'll watch it later.</font>

779
00:51:59,235 --> 00:52:01,393
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Wait...</font>

780
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:03,172
<font color="yellow">Would you like something to drink?</font>

781
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:06,956
<font color="yellow">- Coffee, green tea, solomon's seal...
- No, thank you.</font>

782
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:10,244
<font color="yellow">Then if you need the file later,
let us know.</font>

783
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:12,079
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- Okay.</font>

784
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:18,541
<font color="yellow">But how did you know my name?
I don't think I ever told you.</font>

785
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,121
<font color="yellow">- Your social media...
- What?</font>

786
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:24,360
<font color="yellow">Attorney Choi told me.</font>

787
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:31,217
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.
What's your name?</font>

788
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:34,360
<font color="yellow">We've met before, and you know
my name, but I don't know yours.</font>

789
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:40,304
<font color="yellow">My name is Lee Do Yeon.</font>

790
00:52:40,443 --> 00:52:43,043
<font color="yellow">Then bye, Do Yeon.</font>

791
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:44,813
<font color="yellow">Okay, bye.</font>

792
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:46,378
<font color="yellow">- Get in safely.
- Okay.</font>

793
00:52:49,108 --> 00:52:53,742
<font color="yellow"><i>Something urgent came up, I'll
only be able to make it later tonight.</i></font>

794
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:56,621
<font color="yellow">Do Yeon.</font>

795
00:52:56,621 --> 00:53:00,525
<font color="yellow">I was thinking...</font>

796
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:04,213
<font color="yellow">Going on the TV show is
promoting our office, too.</font>

797
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:06,336
<font color="yellow">We should monitor it.</font>

798
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:11,722
<font color="yellow">But I have a consultation, so do
you think you can go in my place?</font>

799
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,704
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

800
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:17,634
<font color="yellow">Producer Lee personally invited me...</font>

801
00:53:17,634 --> 00:53:19,675
<font color="yellow">And I think it's kind
of rude not to go...</font>

802
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:23,702
<font color="yellow">Yeah, a client postponed our meeting.</font>

803
00:53:23,702 --> 00:53:26,577
<font color="yellow">I'll go there right now.</font>

804
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,606
<font color="yellow">Be ready.</font>

805
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:38,248
<font color="yellow">I can stay for about an hour.</font>

806
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:42,356
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything else.</font>

807
00:53:48,344 --> 00:53:52,449
<font color="yellow"><i>Do Yeon's not checking her text,
I guess the office is busy, good luck.</i></font>

808
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:56,929
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah, we're a bit busy.
Make sure you eat lunch.</i></font>

809
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:00,054
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll call you later.</i></font>

810
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:12,960
<font color="yellow"><i>[My wife demanded that we separate.]</i></font>

811
00:54:13,724 --> 00:54:15,304
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

812
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,250
<font color="yellow">I can't even sleep comfortably.</font>

813
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,483
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

814
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:25,934
<font color="yellow">A cellphone.
I bought it.</font>

815
00:54:25,934 --> 00:54:29,041
<font color="yellow">We can't do anything
when the post office closes.</font>

816
00:54:29,068 --> 00:54:30,985
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

817
00:54:30,985 --> 00:54:34,097
<font color="yellow">That's very expensive,
where did you get the money?</font>

818
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:38,235
<font color="yellow">I just had some money saved up.</font>

819
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,661
<font color="yellow">My gold tooth!</font>

820
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:55,590
<font color="yellow">Hey!
Bitch!</font>

821
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,867
<font color="yellow">- Did you find the letter image?
- Yes, I did.</font>

822
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:01,992
<font color="yellow">- Eun Ok!
- Yes.</font>

823
00:55:01,992 --> 00:55:04,793
<font color="yellow">- You have the review files?
- Yes, they're done.</font>

824
00:55:04,793 --> 00:55:06,463
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

825
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:10,974
<font color="yellow"><i>Should we go to the kids'
cafe when they're done?</i></font>

826
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,331
<font color="yellow"><i>Sure.
Yoon Woo's Mom?</i></font>

827
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:15,197
<font color="yellow"><i>Joon Soo's mom asked me
to watch over Joon Soo.</i></font>

828
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:18,519
<font color="yellow"><i>Then you can't come out
because of Joon Soo?</i></font>

829
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:24,416
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry, my mother-in-law
is visiting a relative.</i></font>

830
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,311
<font color="yellow"><i>What happened with the camera man?</i></font>

831
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:28,989
<font color="yellow"><i>I need to reserve another one
if he can't come.</i></font>

832
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:32,612
<font color="yellow"><i>- I asked my husband, so he'll come.
- That's great.</i></font>

833
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:36,773
<font color="yellow"><i>We'll take Joon Soo to the
kids' cafe and have him play there.</i></font>

834
00:55:36,773 --> 00:55:40,362
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay, but will you be late? I'm supposed
to have dinner at my in-laws.</i></font>

835
00:55:40,362 --> 00:55:43,353
<font color="yellow"><i>Why are mother-in-laws so annoying?</i></font>

836
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:48,552
<font color="yellow"><i>Thank you, Joon Soo's been
wanting to go to the kids' cafe.</i></font>

837
00:55:48,552 --> 00:55:50,894
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll pick him up there later.</i></font>

838
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:54,780
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you all like macaroons?
There's a really good place by my work.</i></font>

839
00:56:06,273 --> 00:56:07,773
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

840
00:56:07,773 --> 00:56:09,884
<font color="yellow"><i>Is this Ms. Jung Soo Yeon?</i></font>

841
00:56:09,884 --> 00:56:13,693
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm Mr. Ji Sun Woo's wife.</i></font>

842
00:56:22,592 --> 00:56:26,536
<font color="yellow">My goodness, you came up
with a really nice title.</font>

843
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:30,661
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- It fits your name.</font>

844
00:56:30,661 --> 00:56:32,913
<font color="yellow">- Can you turn up the volume?
- Sure.</font>

845
00:56:32,913 --> 00:56:36,188
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

846
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:39,137
<font color="yellow"><i>It's no longer a man's place.</i></font>

847
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:42,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Many women are lured by...</i></font>

848
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,255
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jung Soo Yeon?</font>

849
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:47,177
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

850
00:56:48,054 --> 00:56:50,333
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

851
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:02,550
<font color="yellow">Were you taken aback
to get my phone call?</font>

852
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:06,485
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

853
00:57:06,485 --> 00:57:09,217
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing anything wrong here, am I?</font>

854
00:57:11,373 --> 00:57:12,927
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

855
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,188
<font color="yellow">I was curious.</font>

856
00:57:15,188 --> 00:57:19,846
<font color="yellow">I wanted to know who
my husband is dating.</font>

857
00:57:21,389 --> 00:57:24,661
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

858
00:57:24,661 --> 00:57:26,016
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

859
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:29,507
<font color="yellow">What are you sorry for?</font>

860
00:57:30,144 --> 00:57:33,802
<font color="yellow">You should be specific about
why you are apologizing.</font>

861
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,012
<font color="yellow">For dating Director Ji Sun Woo.</font>

862
00:57:40,105 --> 00:57:42,965
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that.</font>

863
00:57:44,177 --> 00:57:51,507
<font color="yellow">Did you think that he would
abandon our family for you?</font>

864
00:57:52,224 --> 00:57:56,072
<font color="yellow">If you did, you must have
been quite disappointed.</font>

865
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,451
<font color="yellow">We don't have any problems.</font>

866
00:57:59,266 --> 00:58:04,413
<font color="yellow">When I told him that
I wanted to meet you</font>

867
00:58:04,413 --> 00:58:07,757
<font color="yellow">he said you're not even worth my time.</font>

868
00:58:08,496 --> 00:58:12,659
<font color="yellow">He said it was really nothing.</font>

869
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:19,222
<font color="yellow">I heard you have a child.</font>

870
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:23,793
<font color="yellow">It's not easy working
and raising a child.</font>

871
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:34,936
<font color="yellow">Were you hoping that my husband
would be the savior there to rescue you?</font>

872
00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:39,559
<font color="yellow">If you did, then I'm so sorry.</font>

873
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:43,867
<font color="yellow">As his wife, I apologize for him.</font>

874
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:49,559
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

875
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:56,003
<font color="yellow">Stop replying back to everything I say.</font>

876
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,217
<font color="yellow">I'm not here to ask you questions.</font>

877
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:02,699
<font color="yellow">I'm not even curious.</font>

878
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:06,275
<font color="yellow">A married woman having an affair
with a married man.</font>

879
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:10,021
<font color="yellow">It's so cliche.</font>

880
00:59:11,072 --> 00:59:14,824
<font color="yellow">"If others do it, it's an affair,
but if I do it, it's romance."</font>

881
00:59:14,824 --> 00:59:17,528
<font color="yellow">Is that what you thought?</font>

882
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:22,318
<font color="yellow">An affair can never be romance.</font>

883
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,248
<font color="yellow">Because of you,
our whole family was wounded.</font>

884
00:59:28,922 --> 00:59:33,579
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry...
- Of course, you should be sorry.</font>

885
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:40,614
<font color="yellow">I hope you have a good memory.</font>

886
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:45,266
<font color="yellow">I hope you will remember
forever the wrong you did.</font>

887
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:50,818
<font color="yellow">I hope you will remember us for the
rest of your life, and be pained by it.</font>

888
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:00,887
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get going.</font>

889
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:06,527
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see what
kind of a person you are.</font>

890
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:10,304
<font color="yellow">But as my husband said,
I shouldn't have wasted my time.</font>

891
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:13,572
<font color="yellow">You're no match for me.</font>

892
01:00:26,461 --> 01:00:28,494
<font color="yellow">Wow...</font>

893
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:30,614
<font color="yellow">The reaction is great.</font>

894
01:00:30,614 --> 01:00:32,552
<font color="yellow">People are loving it.</font>

895
01:00:32,552 --> 01:00:35,286
<font color="yellow">I'm getting texts from my friends,
they must have seen it.</font>

896
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:38,905
<font color="yellow">- I bet we'll have great viewer ratings.
- Yeah, that's good.</font>

897
01:00:38,905 --> 01:00:41,835
<font color="yellow">The reaction is great.
There's already a report on it.</font>

898
01:00:41,835 --> 01:00:44,956
<font color="yellow">We're third-place in a realtime ranking.</font>

899
01:00:44,956 --> 01:00:48,097
<font color="yellow">My mom watched it, too.
She said it was ----ing good.</font>

900
01:00:48,097 --> 01:00:50,983
<font color="yellow">- It must be in the genes.
- Ji Hoon, is he busy?</font>

901
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:54,306
<font color="yellow">- Who?
- That VJ...</font>

902
01:00:54,306 --> 01:00:57,456
<font color="yellow">- He worked on "All About Movie."
- Oh, Hee Sup?</font>

903
01:00:57,456 --> 01:01:00,681
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, Hee Sup.
- I think he's working on a variety show.</font>

904
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:03,132
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- He's busy?</font>

905
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:05,824
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

906
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,742
<font color="yellow">Captain Jung, it's not done?</font>

907
01:01:17,054 --> 01:01:19,996
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You didn't finish your project?</font>

908
01:01:19,996 --> 01:01:23,333
<font color="yellow">- I thought it was due tomorrow.
- What do you mean?</font>

909
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:27,420
<font color="yellow">The client changed his mind,
and wanted it by today.</font>

910
01:01:28,907 --> 01:01:33,246
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I didn't get the message.</font>

911
01:01:33,246 --> 01:01:35,659
<font color="yellow">I'll work on it right now.</font>

912
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:48,764
<font color="yellow"><i>Joon Soo's having fun.
Just come by 6.</i></font>

913
01:01:59,266 --> 01:02:01,769
<font color="yellow">Can you talk?</font>

914
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:03,626
<font color="yellow"><i>Yeah, what is it?</i></font>

915
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:07,704
<font color="yellow">I was wondering when you finish today.</font>

916
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:09,351
<font color="yellow">If you have time...</font>

917
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,519
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm busy, we have a team dinner.</i></font>

918
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:18,659
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you would
be able to pick up Joon Soo.</font>

919
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:23,269
<font color="yellow">He finished school early, and Yoon Ho's
mom took him to a kids' cafe.</font>

920
01:02:23,269 --> 01:02:29,731
<font color="yellow">I need to pick him up by 6:00...
I know I should go, but...</font>

921
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:33,063
<font color="yellow">Something urgent came up.</font>

922
01:02:33,063 --> 01:02:37,530
<font color="yellow">When you said you were leaving,
weren't you prepared for all this?</font>

923
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:42,697
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, we had our first airing,
so I need to take the team out.</font>

924
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:44,601
<font color="yellow"><i>Fine.</i></font>

925
01:02:57,005 --> 01:03:00,467
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll make up the
canceled class tomorrow.</i></font>

926
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:03,679
<font color="yellow"><i>- Why did you cancel the class?
- Is everything okay?</i></font>

927
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,940
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry, I had a very important
guest come visit me.</i></font>

928
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,936
<font color="yellow"><i>Your boyfriend?</i></font>

929
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:15,612
<font color="yellow"><i>Honey, what are you doing for dinner?</i></font>

930
01:03:15,612 --> 01:03:20,581
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not done with work, yet.
But of course, I'll be eating at home.</i></font>

931
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:24,630
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought my husband
would never cheat on me.</i></font>

932
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:29,644
<font color="yellow">I was such a fool.</font>

933
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:43,788
<font color="yellow">Every time I see you...</font>

934
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:48,679
<font color="yellow">I resent the situation I'm in.</font>

935
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:50,376
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

936
01:03:50,376 --> 01:03:57,052
<font color="yellow">I bet you have no idea
how lovable you are.</font>

937
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:01,280
<font color="yellow">After meeting you yesterday...</font>

938
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:08,021
<font color="yellow">I dared think about what it would
have been like if we had met</font>

939
01:04:08,021 --> 01:04:16,521
<font color="yellow">before I met my wife and
you met your husband.</font>

940
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:22,936
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

941
01:04:22,936 --> 01:04:26,257
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry if I offended you.</font>

942
01:04:26,257 --> 01:04:30,545
<font color="yellow">- Let's continue with the consultation.
- I wasn't offended.</font>

943
01:04:31,655 --> 01:04:33,349
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

944
01:04:34,364 --> 01:04:39,597
<font color="yellow">My husband is cheating behind
my back, so why not me?</font>

945
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:43,617
<font color="yellow">Bo Ram...</font>

946
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,291
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

947
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:03,664
<font color="yellow">Do Joon Soo.</font>

948
01:05:03,664 --> 01:05:05,778
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

949
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:08,099
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

950
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:10,652
<font color="yellow">Did you miss me?</font>

951
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:16,056
<font color="yellow">Why are you playing alone?
You should play with your friends.</font>

952
01:05:16,056 --> 01:05:18,958
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.</font>

953
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,735
<font color="yellow">You came?</font>

954
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,485
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

955
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:26,114
<font color="yellow">- I guess his mom's not done yet.
- It looks like she's busy these days.</font>

956
01:05:26,114 --> 01:05:27,288
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

957
01:05:27,288 --> 01:05:32,086
<font color="yellow">Thank you for getting the
camera man to come again.</font>

958
01:05:32,086 --> 01:05:37,041
<font color="yellow">Oh, you didn't hear yet?</font>

959
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,471
<font color="yellow">She must not have told him, yet.</font>

960
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:41,983
<font color="yellow">You came, too?</font>

961
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:44,259
<font color="yellow">We saw his dad, so we
thought you weren't coming.</font>

962
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:47,148
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I had to finish up work.</font>

963
01:05:47,148 --> 01:05:49,396
<font color="yellow">You should try this.
They are macaroons.</font>

964
01:05:49,396 --> 01:05:51,289
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have...</font>

965
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:54,001
<font color="yellow">You're always bringing us stuff.</font>

966
01:05:54,001 --> 01:05:56,239
<font color="yellow">- Thanks.
- Thank you.</font>

967
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:00,429
<font color="yellow">The seafood buffet you
mentioned opened right out front.</font>

968
01:06:00,429 --> 01:06:03,248
<font color="yellow">- We should go there next time.
- Nice.</font>

969
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:07,465
<font color="yellow">- I wanted to go.
- Forget about the camera man.</font>

970
01:06:07,465 --> 01:06:15,418
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to burden you.
- Actually, he moved to another program.</font>

971
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:18,065
<font color="yellow">I got another VJ to come.</font>

972
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:20,208
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Thank you.</font>

973
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:23,534
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, we get to have our
pictures taken by a professional.</font>

974
01:06:23,534 --> 01:06:27,079
<font color="yellow">- It's so nice having a producer father.
- Yeah.</font>

975
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:30,534
<font color="yellow">Next time, we should get all the dads
together, and have a family gathering.</font>

976
01:06:30,534 --> 01:06:32,811
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- We can go camping nearby.</font>

977
01:06:32,811 --> 01:06:34,974
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, let's do that.
- Camping is nice.</font>

978
01:06:34,974 --> 01:06:38,336
<font color="yellow">- I'll prepare the food.
- Really?</font>

979
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:40,045
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

980
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,280
<font color="yellow">You said you have a team dinner.</font>

981
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,465
<font color="yellow">You should be there, no?</font>

982
01:06:58,858 --> 01:07:01,215
<font color="yellow">You said you couldn't come.</font>

983
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:04,458
<font color="yellow">- I guess that was a lie.
- Since you said you can't come</font>

984
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:07,768
<font color="yellow">- I ran over.
- And what were they talking about?</font>

985
01:07:07,768 --> 01:07:10,260
<font color="yellow">When did I say that I
would send a camera man?</font>

986
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,052
<font color="yellow">He's some neighborhood service man?</font>

987
01:07:13,052 --> 01:07:16,780
<font color="yellow">How do you think he would
feel if I keep asking him?</font>

988
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,099
<font color="yellow">You said you got somebody else.</font>

989
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:23,157
<font color="yellow">- Did you mean that?
- Why are you changing the subject?</font>

990
01:07:23,157 --> 01:07:27,021
<font color="yellow">Why are they ordering you around?
Are you a sinner?</font>

991
01:07:27,021 --> 01:07:30,574
<font color="yellow">You ran over, and you
were all servile to them.</font>

992
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:37,833
<font color="yellow">You always say you're doing the best
for Joon Soo, but you really don't know.</font>

993
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:43,121
<font color="yellow">I saw that he was playing all alone.</font>

994
01:07:44,923 --> 01:07:48,777
<font color="yellow">- They're excluding him.
- It's not like that.</font>

995
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:53,336
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo's so shy, I try
hard to make friends for him...</font>

996
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:55,391
<font color="yellow">If you did well,
he wouldn't be like that.</font>

997
01:07:55,391 --> 01:08:00,431
<font color="yellow">Whether the kids are picked up
by their moms or grandmothers</font>

998
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:03,454
<font color="yellow">makes a difference in the
way kids walk out of school.</font>

999
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,530
<font color="yellow">You always use Joon Soo as an excuse.</font>

1000
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:10,614
<font color="yellow">But what have you really done for him?</font>

1001
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:12,503
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1002
01:08:12,503 --> 01:08:16,188
<font color="yellow">You just want to appear as a
super mom, successful at work, too.</font>

1003
01:08:16,188 --> 01:08:19,481
<font color="yellow">You think you're better
than stay-at-home moms.</font>

1004
01:08:19,481 --> 01:08:25,759
<font color="yellow">And you want to show off that your
husband does everything you say.</font>

1005
01:08:28,092 --> 01:08:30,865
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

1006
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:35,077
<font color="yellow">Think what you want.</font>

1007
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:39,859
<font color="yellow">Be as bold to those women
as you are to me.</font>

1008
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:42,011
<font color="yellow">Stop acting like you're their maid!</font>

1009
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:10,296
<font color="yellow">- She's got a rival now.
- Don't drink.</font>

1010
01:09:10,296 --> 01:09:13,418
<font color="yellow">I really can't carry you home today.</font>

1011
01:09:13,418 --> 01:09:17,112
<font color="yellow">You better not.
I'll kill you if you do.</font>

1012
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:20,998
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant...</font>

1013
01:09:20,998 --> 01:09:23,882
<font color="yellow">I would be so offended
if I were your wife.</font>

1014
01:09:23,882 --> 01:09:28,094
<font color="yellow">If I found out my husband
carried home a drunk woman</font>

1015
01:09:28,094 --> 01:09:30,639
<font color="yellow">and even threw out her garbage.</font>

1016
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:33,935
<font color="yellow">I won't do it.</font>

1017
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:37,578
<font color="yellow">That was the first and last time.</font>

1018
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:55,497
<font color="yellow">Oh, why did you come?</font>

1019
01:09:55,497 --> 01:09:59,050
<font color="yellow">Why did I come?
It's our team dinner.</font>

1020
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,975
<font color="yellow">Where is everyone?
They all left?</font>

1021
01:10:01,975 --> 01:10:04,832
<font color="yellow">Yes, and Producer Ahn is throwing up.</font>

1022
01:10:10,412 --> 01:10:11,680
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

1023
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,443
<font color="yellow">Weren't you going straight home?</font>

1024
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,091
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1025
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:22,436
<font color="yellow">Since the two of you aren't
getting along these days</font>

1026
01:10:22,436 --> 01:10:24,400
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going
home to talk to her.</font>

1027
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,612
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1028
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,829
<font color="yellow">I saw that you're
not wearing your ring.</font>

1029
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:32,944
<font color="yellow">You used to always wear it.</font>

1030
01:10:33,653 --> 01:10:34,832
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

1031
01:10:35,657 --> 01:10:38,851
<font color="yellow">It's bothering me a little these days.</font>

1032
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:42,139
<font color="yellow">- Your wife is having an affair, right?
- What?</font>

1033
01:10:42,139 --> 01:10:46,404
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I kind of figured it out.</font>

1034
01:10:49,926 --> 01:10:54,637
<font color="yellow">Does the taking off of
