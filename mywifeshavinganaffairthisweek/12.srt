<font color="yellow"><i>The ending was decided already.</i></font>

103
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:35,083

<font color="yellow"><i>The story after that...</i></font>

105
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:44,827
<font color="yellow"><i>It's exactly the same as

00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,731
<font color="yellow">- What is that? You got one again?
- Huh?</font>

145
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:32,365
<font color="yellow">Well... No.</font>

146
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:36,724
<font color="yellow">- I think I should stay out of this.
- Gosh, you.</font>

147
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:39,625
<font color="yellow">Someone piled all the stuffed animals
to one side of the machine so I just...</font>

148
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,798
<font color="yellow">- Mom, I'm going to take a bath.
- Okay.</font>

149
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,307
<font color="yellow">He takes baths by himself?</font>

150
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,416
<font color="yellow">Yes. He bathes himself now.</font>

151
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,096
<font color="yellow">He said it's embarrassing to
have me bathe him.</font>

152
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:50,880
<font color="yellow">Really? Oh my.</font>

153
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,597
<font color="yellow">I guess he is a guy too.</font>

154
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:57,951
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with that?</font>

155
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:01,643
<font color="yellow">It has been like that for a while.</font>

156
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,662
<font color="yellow">You have to get a new one.
It could hurt your eyes.</font>

157
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:20,433
<font color="yellow">Is there anything else that I can do?</font>

158
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,801
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

159
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:25,964
<font color="yellow">- My next door neighbor said I'm lucky.
- What?</font>

160
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:29,842
<font color="yellow">She said we are lucky to be
a "weekend couple."</font>

161
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:33,565
<font color="yellow">Since you come here from time to time,
she thinks we are a "weekend couple."</font>

162
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:37,307
<font color="yellow">I heard "weekend couple" is
the "thumbs up" among moms like me.</font>

163
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:39,259
<font color="yellow">Then just tell them we are
a "weekend couple."</font>

164
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,567
<font color="yellow">It's better than them
pointing fingers at you.</font>

165
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,294
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

166
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:45,149
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by "thumbs up?"</font>

167
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,870
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo taught me.</font>

168
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,365
<font color="yellow">Thumbs up.</font>

169
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,144
<font color="yellow">I will get going.</font>

170
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:01,706
<font color="yellow">Leave the kimchi out
for two to three days.</font>

171
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:04,349
<font color="yellow">And you have to put the other dishes
in the refrigerator right away.</font>

172
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:06,614
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it. I will take
care of it from now on.</font>

173
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:08,514
<font color="yellow">If I don't do this, you are going</font>

174
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:10,413
<font color="yellow">to buy things
at the convenience store again.</font>

175
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,929
<font color="yellow">Do you know how great
their box lunch is?</font>

176
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,687
<font color="yellow">I will enjoy it. Thanks.
Let me go talk to Joon Soo.</font>

177
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,802
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Joon Soo.
- Dad.</font>

178
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:21,240
<font color="yellow">Wow, Joon Soo. You're all grown up.</font>

179
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,828
<font color="yellow">You are a man.</font>

180
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,224
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, thumbs up.</font>

181
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:27,975
<font color="yellow">Bye, Joon Soo.</font>

182
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:38,077
<font color="yellow">Smile please. One, two...</font>

183
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,798
<font color="yellow">Yong Sik, sorry to keep you waiting.</font>

184
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:44,908
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Smile please.</font>

185
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:46,636
<font color="yellow">One, two...</font>

186
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:50,311
<font color="yellow">One more please. One, two...</font>

187
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,966
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

188
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,181
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your wedding.</font>

189
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,841
<font color="yellow">The bride shouldn't make a face.</font>

190
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:21,961
<font color="yellow">You will get to keep this picture
for the rest of your life.</font>

191
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:24,315
<font color="yellow">Smile.</font>

192
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:27,892
<font color="yellow">We will take the picture. Smile please.</font>

193
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,616
<font color="yellow">One, two...</font>

194
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:07,477
<font color="yellow">Bride? Your wedding is about to start.
You have to go.</font>

195
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:09,144
<font color="yellow">Please open the door.</font>

196
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:30,155
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's so dusty here.</font>

197
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:32,743
<font color="yellow">You are here. When did you get here?</font>

198
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:36,363
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you are going to
pay your rent today?</font>

199
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:40,078
<font color="yellow">I was going to give it to you today</font>

200
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:42,610
<font color="yellow">but my client said he will pay me
in a few days--</font>

201
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,179
<font color="yellow">What do you mean
your client is going to pay you?</font>

202
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,693
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen anyone come here
since you've opened this office.</font>

203
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:53,673
<font color="yellow">You said you are an attorney, so I was
hoping you'd make my building thrive.</font>

204
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:57,563
<font color="yellow">Forget rent. You can't even
pay your electricity bills.</font>

205
00:13:57,563 --> 00:14:00,131
<font color="yellow">I'm going to pay it.</font>

206
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,355
<font color="yellow">If I can get a crime case,
I can pay you for sure.</font>

207
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,745
<font color="yellow">If you don't pay me by tomorrow,
I'm going to throw all your stuff out.</font>

208
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,663
<font color="yellow">Please don't be like that.</font>

209
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:11,788
<font color="yellow">I have to go work.</font>

210
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:18,149
<font color="yellow">He's here. I heard he is a
"garbage attorney."</font>

211
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,056
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean?
- He's as bad as trash as an attorney.</font>

212
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:24,501
<font color="yellow">He had an affair with his client who
came to prepare for a divorce law suit.</font>

213
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,307
<font color="yellow">He got kicked out by his wife.</font>

214
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:30,586
<font color="yellow">So he has the attorney title,
but he is just like a beggar.</font>

215
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:34,527
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

216
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:36,576
<font color="yellow">I'm not a beggar.</font>

217
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,832
<font color="yellow">- I guess he heard me.
- You talk so loud.</font>

218
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:42,711
<font color="yellow">How could I not hear it?</font>

219
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:45,952
<font color="yellow">- Are you married?
- What?</font>

220
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:50,216
<font color="yellow">Let me know if you get divorced.</font>

221
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:53,179
<font color="yellow">Is he flirting with me?</font>

222
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,138
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

223
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:59,591
<font color="yellow">How did this happen?</font>

224
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,841
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that I'm here?
How come you don't even look at me?</font>

225
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:30,625
<font color="yellow">Let's stop it now.</font>

226
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,777
<font color="yellow">I didn't see a girl.</font>

227
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,634
<font color="yellow">Look. You didn't see a girl?</font>

228
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:47,520
<font color="yellow">People lose hundreds of hairs in a day.</font>

229
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,941
<font color="yellow">But I lose thousands a day.</font>

230
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:53,852
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

231
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,294
<font color="yellow">I have alopecia areata.</font>

232
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:59,788
<font color="yellow">I was just wandering around
and those stuck on me.</font>

233
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:02,958
<font color="yellow">But why does it have to be
long female hair?</font>

234
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,743
<font color="yellow">That's not it. That is just not it.</font>

235
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:07,892
<font color="yellow">And I don't have money.</font>

236
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:09,547
<font color="yellow">I don't have money to date a girl.</font>

237
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:12,948
<font color="yellow">If I had money, my office...</font>

238
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:14,594
<font color="yellow">- Never mind.
- What?</font>

239
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:17,418
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you would date
someone if you had money?</font>

240
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:21,202
<font color="yellow">Do you think I have money?
You constantly buy stuff.</font>

241
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:23,250
<font color="yellow">Those things don't cost that much.</font>

242
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,466
<font color="yellow">If I got all my alimony from
my ex-husband</font>

243
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,285
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have lived with you
like a beggar.</font>

244
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:31,746
<font color="yellow">Beggar? Who do you think
caused all this mess?</font>

245
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:34,361
<font color="yellow">- If we didn't go on that trip...
- If I didn't meet you</font>

246
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,601
<font color="yellow">people would still treat me well.
I could have been a rich madam.</font>

247
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:39,731
<font color="yellow">- Then leave.
- Hey!</font>

248
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,592
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't throw that.</font>

249
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:43,095
<font color="yellow">I'm going to return-- Hey.</font>

250
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:45,100
<font color="yellow">I can't return it if it breaks.</font>

251
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,738
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Hey, this is--</font>

252
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:53,666
<font color="yellow">Amazing.</font>

253
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,476
<font color="yellow">I guess some foolish guy
in the neighborhood was here.</font>

254
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:01,654
<font color="yellow">Is he really a fool?</font>

255
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,451
<font color="yellow">That's mine.</font>

256
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:06,797
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I piled it up.</font>

257
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,903
<font color="yellow">I went inside to get some change.</font>

258
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,134
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

259
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:12,845
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

260
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:21,406
<font color="yellow">But I just put in 1,000 won.</font>

261
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,761
<font color="yellow">That's my 1,000 won.</font>

262
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,305
<font color="yellow">Well, 1,000 won...</font>

263
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:30,865
<font color="yellow">Yes, I got it.</font>

264
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:42,007
<font color="yellow">What is this? Did it get stuck again?</font>

265
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,767
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is driving me crazy.</font>

266
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:48,618
<font color="yellow">There's no need to do that.</font>

267
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:50,916
<font color="yellow">The owner wouldn't give it to you.</font>

268
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,605
<font color="yellow">- He won't give it to me?
- No.</font>

269
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,708
<font color="yellow">I got stuck several times,
but he didn't let me take it.</font>

270
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,988
<font color="yellow">How could he not let me take it?</font>

271
00:17:57,988 --> 00:17:59,691
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

272
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:11,960
<font color="yellow">- Wait. Pull my hand.
- What?</font>

273
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,871
<font color="yellow">Pull my hand.</font>

274
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:23,630
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.</font>

275
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,108
<font color="yellow">The owner is mean. Why would he not
let you take it? This is so pretty.</font>

276
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,001
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

277
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:37,153
<font color="yellow">You live one floor up, right?</font>

278
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:39,893
<font color="yellow">- I've seen you several times.
- Oh, yes.</font>

279
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:46,960
<font color="yellow">- You can take it.
- No, you don't have to give it to me.</font>

280
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,683
<font color="yellow">It was your 1,000 won.</font>

281
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,835
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

282
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:53,943
<font color="yellow">I'm not that narrow-minded.</font>

283
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:56,741
<font color="yellow">I have the same one at home.</font>

284
00:18:56,741 --> 00:19:00,502
<font color="yellow">To tell you the truth,
I have the same one too.</font>

285
00:19:00,502 --> 00:19:03,270
<font color="yellow">Claw machine lovers like us</font>

286
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,208
<font color="yellow">won't stop playing because
we have the same one at home, right?</font>

287
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,337
<font color="yellow">Right. Claw machine...</font>

288
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:17,848
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she is funny.</font>

289
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,905
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

290
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:24,101
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

291
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,781
<font color="yellow">You are sitting there as if
you are at your house.</font>

292
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:32,766
<font color="yellow">I should change
the password or something.</font>

293
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,886
<font color="yellow">You still can't get a hold of Bo Young?</font>

294
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,280
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you two?</font>

295
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,794
<font color="yellow">You have to tell me why so that</font>

296
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:46,724
<font color="yellow">I can console you or
help you guys get back together.</font>

297
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:50,803
<font color="yellow">You and Bo Young are fools.</font>

298
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:53,519
<font color="yellow"><i>I picked out good items
that we came up with.</i></font>

299
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,182
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about
searching for new items for a while.</font>

300
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:58,881
<font color="yellow">- Are you going to the army?
- What?</font>

301
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,355
<font color="yellow">You sound like you're going away.</font>

302
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,730
<font color="yellow">- I want to take a break.
- What?</font>

303
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,796
<font color="yellow">"Why do you need a break?
Where are you headed to?"</font>

304
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:09,623
<font color="yellow">"When are you coming back?"</font>

305
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:12,419
<font color="yellow">I hope you don't ask me those things.</font>

306
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,317
<font color="yellow">I might never come back.</font>

307
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:24,901
<font color="yellow">Just pick one. Detergents are all same.</font>

308
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,606
<font color="yellow"><i>Joon Soo has sensitive skin.
You can't just use a random one.</i></font>

309
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:30,016
<font color="yellow"><i>Honey, do you like the one that has
lavender fragrance in it?</i></font>

310
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:32,002
<font color="yellow"><i>I have no idea what
"lavender fragrance" is.</i></font>

311
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:34,040
<font color="yellow"><i>But I liked your fragrance.</i></font>

312
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,923
<font color="yellow"><i>- That's the lavender fragrance.
- Oh, really?</i></font>

313
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,832
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

314
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,709
<font color="yellow">What kind of detergent should I buy?</font>

315
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,351
<font color="yellow">It all looks the same.</font>

316
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,468
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

317
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,553
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

318
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:03,673
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

319
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:06,229
<font color="yellow">If you are going to be like this,
why did you divorce him?</font>

320
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:09,890
<font color="yellow">You cook, he changes the light,
and you pick detergent for him.</font>

321
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,967
<font color="yellow">You guys meet up and eat together
from time to time.</font>

322
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,563
<font color="yellow">It seems like you guys are going to
get back together soon.</font>

323
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,079
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

324
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,597
<font color="yellow">You guys look better together
now than before the breakup.</font>

325
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:22,067
<font color="yellow">- Am I right?
- No.</font>

326
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:24,794
<font color="yellow">You say no, but you are laughing.</font>

327
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:27,615
<font color="yellow">That's really not it.</font>

328
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,493
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

329
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,373
<font color="yellow">This is the one.</font>

330
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:39,016
<font color="yellow">Why are they only
selling this in a pack?</font>

331
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:41,511
<font color="yellow">Two bottles is too much for me.</font>

332
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:03,270
<font color="yellow">Take your time.</font>

333
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:11,030
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. Here.
- Yes.</font>

334
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,272
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I could just buy one.</font>

335
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:15,509
<font color="yellow">Otherwise I would have had no choice
but to keep all that to myself.</font>

336
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:19,143
<font color="yellow">Oh, do you live alone?</font>

337
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:22,670
<font color="yellow">I got divorced. Did you not
hear the news yet?</font>

338
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,509
<font color="yellow">Wherever I go,
I never talked about it myself</font>

339
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,605
<font color="yellow">but people always find out
that I got divorced.</font>

340
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:29,618
<font color="yellow">Oh, me too...</font>

341
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:32,711
<font color="yellow">Somehow they find out.</font>

342
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:34,424
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

343
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,439
<font color="yellow">- By any chance...
- Huh?</font>

344
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:40,384
<font color="yellow">There's a frying pan claw machine.
Have you seen one?</font>

345
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,719
<font color="yellow">I just need a cheap frying pan,
but I don't want to go buy one.</font>

346
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:48,384
<font color="yellow">Oh, there's one that has all the
appliances in it.</font>

347
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,471
<font color="yellow">This is the chauffeur service.</font>

348
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:17,454
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you.</font>

349
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,295
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

350
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,769
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

351
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:56,126
<font color="yellow">Where is all my stuff?</font>

352
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,048
<font color="yellow">Your wife moved out.</font>

353
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:00,260
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she moved out?</font>

354
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,048
<font color="yellow">She said she has to leave now.
So I gave her security deposit back too.</font>

355
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:08,664
<font color="yellow">- Security deposit?
- Yes.</font>

356
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:11,757
<font color="yellow"><i>The person cannot be reached.</i></font>

357
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:14,623
<font color="yellow"><i>The person cannot receive the call.</i></font>

358
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:29,036
<font color="yellow">Hello? It's me.</font>

359
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:34,435
<font color="yellow">I told you I'm going to pay you the rent.</font>

360
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:37,685
<font color="yellow">You got a new lock?</font>

361
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,653
<font color="yellow">Can't you wait just a few days?</font>

362
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,604
<font color="yellow">Then just for tonight...</font>

363
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:47,239
<font color="yellow">I have nowhere to go.</font>

364
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,576
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm the dad.
I'm responsible for the baby.</i></font>

365
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:58,261
<font color="yellow"><i>You don't have to be responsible for
the baby. I decided to have the baby</i></font>

366
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:00,284
<font color="yellow"><i>- so I will take care of the baby.
- What am I then?</i></font>

367
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:03,271
<font color="yellow"><i>- Biological father.
- Okay, I'm biological father to the baby</i></font>

368
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,912
<font color="yellow"><i>- then what am I to you?
- Don't put me in a corner.</i></font>

369
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:07,467
<font color="yellow"><i>I might run away.</i></font>

370
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:27,009
<font color="yellow">This is great. I was going to go
back to Seoul anyway.</font>

371
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,555
<font color="yellow">Eun Jung is going to be happy.</font>

372
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:33,647
<font color="yellow">Eun Jung had a hard time
covering for you.</font>

373
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:37,122
<font color="yellow">The CEO and Hyun Woo were anxious
because you were not there.</font>

374
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:40,192
<font color="yellow">- This is great.
- I'm going back to empty my house.</font>

375
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:43,421
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't leave it like that too long.</font>

376
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:46,843
<font color="yellow">The real estate agent said the house
has been sold.</font>

377
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,616
<font color="yellow">Come back to work.</font>

378
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,722
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be that careful now.</font>

379
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:57,989
<font color="yellow">If you are doing this because of me,
you don't have to do this.</font>

380
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:03,365
<font color="yellow">Since you don't want me to, I'm not
going to try to stay by your side.</font>

381
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:07,057
<font color="yellow">I just need to be the biological father.
Isn't that all?</font>

382
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:14,000
<font color="yellow">It was so nice to hear birds singing
here in the morning.</font>

383
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,182
<font color="yellow">I have to say bye to that now.</font>

384
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:21,237
<font color="yellow">Gaeddong, Let's go to Seoul with Mom.</font>

385
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:45,644
<font color="yellow">How could you call the baby "Gaeddong?"</font>

386
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:50,056
<font color="yellow">There are many other pretty things.
Sky, wind, star, flower...</font>

387
00:26:50,056 --> 00:26:52,751
<font color="yellow">Why? Gaeddong sounds friendly.</font>

388
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:55,113
<font color="yellow">But you shouldn't call it "Gaeddong."</font>

389
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,817
<font color="yellow">You can never call the baby that.
Change it. You must change it.</font>

390
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,971
<font color="yellow">Did you forget what you said?</font>

391
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,537
<font color="yellow">You said you won't ask me for anything.</font>

392
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,299
<font color="yellow">You are a writer.</font>

393
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:08,336
<font color="yellow">Let's think of a name in a documentary
perspective. This is not a variety show.</font>

394
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:11,086
<font color="yellow">This is a belly baby nickname. It's okay.</font>

395
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:14,769
<font color="yellow">The baby looks like a pretty dog
in the ultrasound.</font>

396
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:18,317
<font color="yellow">So I started calling the baby "Gaeddong."</font>

397
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:21,593
<font color="yellow">You have a picture of
the baby's ultrasound?</font>

398
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:23,479
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see it?</font>

399
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:26,883
<font color="yellow">- No way.
- Show me.</font>

400
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,175
<font color="yellow">- Is this our baby?
- Do you know where the baby is?</font>

401
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:35,778
<font color="yellow">Isn't this the baby?</font>

402
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,461
<font color="yellow">Right. That's the baby.</font>

403
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:45,000
<font color="yellow">Doesn't the baby look more like
a peanut than a dog?</font>

404
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,116
<font color="yellow">Let's go now.</font>

405
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:51,865
<font color="yellow">You can never call the baby that.</font>

406
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:55,490
<font color="yellow">Can't I ask that as a biological father?</font>

407
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,059
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Seoul. You said you are
going to go to Seoul.</font>

408
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,976
<font color="yellow">We are going. Let's go.</font>

409
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,675
<font color="yellow">Gaeddong. Gosh.</font>

410
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:08,048
<font color="yellow">- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.</font>

411
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:13,449
<font color="yellow">Do you want some coffee?</font>

412
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:16,423
<font color="yellow">The claw machine over there has a short
claw. So you can't just pick one.</font>

413
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:20,480
<font color="yellow">The owner loosened the one next to that
so you can't really pick things up.</font>

414
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,232
<font color="yellow">- And the one on the back street--
- Oh, that one...</font>

415
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:24,780
<font color="yellow">There's a toast claw machine there.</font>

416
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,182
<font color="yellow">- Did you try that already?
- Yes.</font>

417
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:29,336
<font color="yellow">The owner put a ton
of erasers in the box</font>

418
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,183
<font color="yellow">so I couldn't pick up the box.</font>

419
00:28:31,183 --> 00:28:33,894
<font color="yellow">The one in front of the convenience
store is the best one.</font>

420
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:38,060
<font color="yellow">If you really want to do it,
use the ones on the back street.</font>

421
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,727
<font color="yellow">There was a drone there.</font>

422
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,988
<font color="yellow">I picked it up.</font>

423
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:46,007
<font color="yellow">Oh my. I went there early morning to
get it, but someone already picked it up.</font>

424
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,278
<font color="yellow">I went out to exercise and...</font>

425
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:51,296
<font color="yellow">Since it's the rare one...</font>

426
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,421
<font color="yellow">- Does it work?
- Yes, it works.</font>

427
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:56,246
<font color="yellow">But I'm not good at flying it.</font>

428
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:58,121
<font color="yellow">The wing scares me.</font>

429
00:28:58,121 --> 00:29:00,748
<font color="yellow">It's very sensitive.
You have to be very careful.</font>

430
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,337
<font color="yellow">Your wife hated you picking up
stuff at the claw machine, right?</font>

431
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:10,060
<font color="yellow">She didn't hate it,
but she gave me looks.</font>

432
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,019
<font color="yellow">My husband always complained about it.</font>

433
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:17,156
<font color="yellow">Well. It was nice to have someone
complain about that.</font>

434
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,057
<font color="yellow">That's right. If it wasn't for her</font>

435
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:21,778
<font color="yellow">I might have spent all my money there.</font>

436
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:23,654
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
- It's over there.</font>

437
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:26,238
<font color="yellow">- Frying pan claw machine.
- Oh, okay.</font>

438
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:29,413
<font color="yellow">You are a pro. You easily
picked up the frying pan.</font>

439
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:32,824
<font color="yellow">I'm not a pro. I just play it a lot.</font>

440
00:29:32,824 --> 00:29:35,810
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go on a date?</font>

441
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,295
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Your reaction was very special.</font>

442
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:44,106
<font color="yellow">The worst thing about living alone is
that you have to eat alone.</font>

443
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:47,891
<font color="yellow">But for a divorcee to say
"Do you want to eat lunch with me?"</font>

444
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:50,259
<font color="yellow">I think that sounds like I'm trying
to latch onto you.</font>

445
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:53,096
<font color="yellow">"Do you want to go on a date?"</font>

446
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:56,884
<font color="yellow">I think that sounds better.</font>

447
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:59,554
<font color="yellow">Now that I think about it, that's true.</font>

448
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:03,641
<font color="yellow">- So your answer is?
- What?</font>

449
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:06,009
<font color="yellow">Let's eat dinner together then.</font>

450
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,092
<font color="yellow">Did you clean the house?</font>

451
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:23,374
<font color="yellow">I didn't know when you would come back.</font>

452
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:27,040
<font color="yellow">I didn't want you and the baby
to stay in a dusty room.</font>

453
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,391
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- You are welcome.</font>

454
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:33,019
<font color="yellow">That has a lot of meaning to it.</font>

455
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:36,575
<font color="yellow">Thank you for respecting my decision too.</font>

456
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:38,468
<font color="yellow">You are going to go back to work, right?</font>

457
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:44,457
<font color="yellow">Well. I haven't decided...</font>

458
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:46,214
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

459
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:53,326
<font color="yellow">You might be okay, but I thought
the baby might want to see dad.</font>

460
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:56,086
<font color="yellow">Do me a favor. Please keep it there.</font>

461
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:57,761
<font color="yellow">I will get going.</font>

462
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:00,700
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

463
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:06,726
<font color="yellow">It's so tiring.</font>

464
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:13,954
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired.</font>

465
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:34,526
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Gosh, Ann Joon Young.
How sneaky...</font>

466
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,663
<font color="yellow">Do you have some good news?</font>

467
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:46,044
<font color="yellow">Huh? No, why?</font>

468
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:48,192
<font color="yellow">You were humming.</font>

469
00:31:48,192 --> 00:31:50,068
<font color="yellow">Was I?</font>

470
00:31:50,068 --> 00:31:52,634
<font color="yellow">When was I humming?</font>

471
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:58,290
<font color="yellow">Are you dating someone?</font>

472
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,310
<font color="yellow">- A woman?
- It has to be either a man or a woman.</font>

473
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:07,405
<font color="yellow">She is a woman.</font>

474
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,008
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

475
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:11,105
<font color="yellow">She lives one floor down.</font>

476
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:13,692
<font color="yellow">She;s divorced.</font>

477
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:16,953
<font color="yellow">She is talkative.</font>

478
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:20,531
<font color="yellow">But we understand each other very well.
And we both like claw machines.</font>

479
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:23,500
<font color="yellow">I guess she is not just a person
who lives in the same building.</font>

480
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,361
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

481
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:31,679
<font color="yellow">But I'm surprised that I got close with
a woman who I don't really know.</font>

482
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,093
<font color="yellow">Should I tell you a surprising story?</font>

483
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:36,650
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

484
00:32:41,737 --> 00:32:44,405
<font color="yellow">Bo Young got pregnant.</font>

485
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:49,160
<font color="yellow">What? Bo Young got pregnant? Really?</font>

486
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,222
<font color="yellow">And it's my baby.</font>

487
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:52,971
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

488
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:01,134
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

489
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:03,509
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

490
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,717
<font color="yellow">It's good, right?</font>

491
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:10,755
<font color="yellow">If I want to season it and eat it,
how much should I buy?</font>

492
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,313
<font color="yellow">How many people will be eating it?</font>

493
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:15,397
<font color="yellow">- Three.
- Okay.</font>

494
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:17,483
<font color="yellow">This will be enough.</font>

495
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:19,191
<font color="yellow">- I will take it.
- Okay.</font>

496
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:27,046
<font color="yellow">Let me do it.</font>

497
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:32,019
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I'm very strange?</font>

498
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,535
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

499
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:38,913
<font color="yellow">I don't really know you,
but I asked you to go out on a date.</font>

500
00:33:38,913 --> 00:33:43,074
<font color="yellow">I don't think you're very strange.
A little maybe.</font>

501
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:45,544
<font color="yellow">I was just kidding.</font>

502
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:48,125
<font color="yellow">I don't like eating alone either.</font>

503
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:58,250
<font color="yellow">It's 9,000 won.</font>

504
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:05,653
<font color="yellow">- Do you need the receipt?
- No, that's okay.</font>

505
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:08,594
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Please be happy.</font>

506
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:10,172
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

507
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:13,603
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good luck to you too.</font>

508
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:23,965
<font color="yellow">It has been a while since
I've had a beer. It's good.</font>

509
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:27,699
<font color="yellow">It has been a while since I drank
beer with someone else.</font>

510
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,525
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a close friend?
Or someone you know?</font>

511
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:32,840
<font color="yellow">I don't have many friends.</font>

512
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,831
<font color="yellow">It's just that my husband and I broke up.</font>

513
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,829
<font color="yellow">I didn't like people looking at
me thinking</font>

514
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,952
<font color="yellow">I have a long story to tell and
I did something wrong.</font>

515
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:46,806
<font color="yellow">There are times when people try to
not talk about getting divorced</font>

516
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:50,438
<font color="yellow">and things get awkward.</font>

517
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:52,800
<font color="yellow">I haven't run into those kind of
situations yet. So I'm not sure.</font>

518
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,532
<font color="yellow">Oh, you said it's fairly recent.</font>

519
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:58,302
<font color="yellow">You should learn a lot from me.</font>

520
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,657
<font color="yellow">- We are close friends, right?
- What?</font>

521
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:10,963
<font color="yellow">Yes. We ate dinner together
and we are drinking together.</font>

522
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:15,219
<font color="yellow">Then you are my best friend
in this neighborhood.</font>

523
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:20,268
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there are a lot of people who
got divorced in this neighborhood.</font>

524
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:23,130
<font color="yellow">But there won't be a nice guy like you.</font>

525
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,202
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

526
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,293
<font color="yellow">You like compliments, right?</font>

527
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:35,454
<font color="yellow">I'm very emotional.</font>

528
00:35:35,454 --> 00:35:38,099
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go on a real date?</font>

529
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,358
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Napkin.</font>

530
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:42,835
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. What is wrong with me?</font>

531
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:45,246
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't say these things when
you are drinking something.</font>

532
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:18,568
<font color="yellow"><i>Father.</i></font>

533
00:36:33,581 --> 00:36:37,494
<font color="yellow">This is the new proposal. Please take a
look at it and edit it if you need to.</font>

534
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,605
<font color="yellow">- Writer Kwon.
- Bo Young.</font>

535
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:48,148
<font color="yellow">- Bo Young.
- Have you been well?</font>

536
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:51,411
<font color="yellow">- I missed you.
- I missed you.</font>

537
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:53,954
<font color="yellow">To celebrate Writer Kwon's comeback,
I will pay for the meal.</font>

538
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:55,496
<font color="yellow">Drink.</font>

539
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:57,360
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. No, thank you.</font>

540
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,679
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's not that much anyway.</font>

541
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,068
<font color="yellow">You will come up with better ideas
after you drink some.</font>

542
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,784
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.</font>

543
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:08,664
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry about me.
- She said no. Gosh.</font>

544
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:11,681
<font color="yellow">I guess it's because I'm an old guy.</font>

545
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,422
<font color="yellow">You fill her cup.</font>

546
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:14,954
<font color="yellow">I will fill your cup.</font>

547
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,467
<font color="yellow">Stop it. She said she doesn't want to
drink today.</font>

548
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:21,030
<font color="yellow">Guys, I'm pregnant.</font>

549
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,931
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- The baby might hear that.</font>

550
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:29,914
<font color="yellow">So please don't ask me to
drink alcohol, coffee, and other things.</font>

551
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,313
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can work late at night.</font>

552
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:35,860
<font color="yellow">Instead, I will try to work
harder during the day.</font>

553
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,650
<font color="yellow">It might be hard to eat with you guys
because I'm having morning sickness.</font>

554
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,139
<font color="yellow">So please eat lunch without me.</font>

555
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,822
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry to make you guys change
your menus because of me.</font>

556
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:47,659
<font color="yellow">I will take care of myself.</font>

557
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:56,177
<font color="yellow">I think everyone is curious...
But we are all hesitating. I will ask.</font>

558
00:37:56,177 --> 00:37:58,215
<font color="yellow">Who is the baby's dad?</font>

559
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,233
<font color="yellow">Don't be curious about it.</font>

560
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:08,884
<font color="yellow">Even if you guys are curious,
you guys will never find out.</font>

561
00:38:08,884 --> 00:38:11,010
<font color="yellow">Eat.</font>

562
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,456
<font color="yellow">I feel so connected to you already.</font>

563
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:29,239
<font color="yellow">You still have the key to open my heart.</font>

564
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,172
<font color="yellow">Bye, my love.</font>

565
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:37,351
<font color="yellow">Ah Ra.</font>

566
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:39,760
<font color="yellow">I will miss you a lot until
the next time I see you.</font>

567
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,391
<font color="yellow">I miss you even when
I'm looking at your face.</font>

568
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:09,987
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey.</font>

569
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:13,114
<font color="yellow">- Who are you?
- Who are you?</font>

570
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:15,746
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? Hey.</font>

571
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:20,438
<font color="yellow">I'm her husband. Husband. You know?</font>

572
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:23,371
<font color="yellow">- Are you her ex-husband?
- I'm her husband!</font>

573
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,369
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, excuse me. Please, please.</font>

574
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,422
<font color="yellow">Do you want beer?</font>

575
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:40,748
<font color="yellow">I will buy the conditioner
and the treatment.</font>

576
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:42,650
<font color="yellow">I have to buy milk.</font>

577
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:53,559
<font color="yellow">- Here?
- Little more.</font>

578
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:56,518
<font color="yellow">You got it.</font>

579
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:03,199
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Hold on. Could you hold on a minute?</font>

580
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,789
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Hold on a second.</font>

581
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:06,400
<font color="yellow">Wait, this is...</font>

582
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,355
<font color="yellow">These are some side dishes.</font>

583
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:18,545
<font color="yellow">I followed the recipe.
It won't taste that bad.</font>

584
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:21,614
<font color="yellow">- You don't need to--
- Enjoy it.</font>

585
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:23,543
<font color="yellow">I will enjoy it.</font>

586
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:39,579
<font color="yellow">I think this is the place for you.
You look great when you are here working.</font>

587
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:41,960
<font color="yellow">What do you mean all of a sudden?</font>

588
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,322
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

589
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,179
<font color="yellow">Where were you?</font>

590
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:09,831
<font color="yellow">I went to the post office.
Is today a special day?</font>

591
00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:13,746
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You forgot your husband's
"death anniversary?"</font>

592
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:17,481
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's his "death anniversary."</font>

593
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:19,322
<font color="yellow">Why don't you make some pancake?</font>

594
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:22,380
<font color="yellow">Make him feel better.</font>

595
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,338
<font color="yellow">I was his favorite person in the world.</font>

596
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:30,023
<font color="yellow">He would be happy just to see me.</font>

597
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:32,650
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's so good.</font>

598
00:41:34,697 --> 00:41:37,876
<font color="yellow">We are going to the graveyard.
Why are you taking the shovel?</font>

599
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:40,507
<font color="yellow">I need it. Let's go.</font>

600
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:42,885
<font color="yellow">What do you need it for?</font>

601
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:46,527
<font color="yellow">You said our old man liked you the most.</font>

602
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,742
<font color="yellow">Since you are all dressed up
and look nice</font>

603
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:51,001
<font color="yellow">to make him happy</font>

604
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:54,952
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bury you with him.</font>

605
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:59,835
<font color="yellow">You are so funny. You are kidding, right?</font>

606
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:15,786
<font color="yellow">It's a bit expensive, right?</font>

607
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:20,135
<font color="yellow">If you sign two year contract, we can
lower the price to 380,000 won.</font>

608
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:21,639
<font color="yellow">Just a moment please.</font>

609
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:37,291
<font color="yellow">Team Leader Jung is going
to get promoted no matter what, right?</font>

610
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:40,253
<font color="yellow">Of course. It would be weird if another
person get promoted.</font>

611
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,782
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

612
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:47,663
<font color="yellow">What does your husband do for a living?</font>

613
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,813
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jung Soo Yeon.</font>

614
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:58,826
<font color="yellow">Do you need that information to
decide if I can get promoted or not?</font>

615
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:08,228
<font color="yellow">Oh, you got divorced?</font>

616
00:43:08,228 --> 00:43:10,210
<font color="yellow">It's not because of that.</font>

617
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,802
<font color="yellow">I'm a single mom.</font>

618
00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:16,259
<font color="yellow">But I always did my best
as a Team Leader.</font>

619
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:22,268
<font color="yellow">So please make a decision only based on
my job performance and my capabilities.</font>

620
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,143
<font color="yellow">Team Leader Jung.</font>

621
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:48,438
<font color="yellow">That's okay.
I can get promoted next time.</font>

622
00:43:51,268 --> 00:43:54,393
<font color="yellow">We will start the meeting in five
minutes in the office downstairs.</font>

623
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:08,391
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- One of the guests can't make it.</font>

624
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:10,416
<font color="yellow">Why? What happened?</font>

625
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:12,469
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing.</font>

626
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:16,652
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have
a cup of coffee with me?</font>

627
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:20,083
<font color="yellow">Something did happen, right?</font>

628
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,918
<font color="yellow">I didn't get promoted.</font>

629
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:26,177
<font color="yellow">They are so mean.
They made you work so hard.</font>

630
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,014
<font color="yellow">I think so too.</font>

631
00:44:28,014 --> 00:44:32,594
<font color="yellow">- Should I go to your office?
<i>- Huh?</i></font>

632
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:36,230
<font color="yellow">Well. I have a dinner meeting tonight.</font>

633
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,472
<font color="yellow">No, that's okay.</font>

634
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:42,465
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

635
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:44,282
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

636
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:55,065

637
00:44:55,065 --> 00:44:57,096

- What news?</font>

638
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:59,577
<font color="yellow">- Producer Ann Joon Young resigned.
- What?</font>

639
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:21,449
<font color="yellow">Why is not answering his phone?</font>

640
00:45:58,264 --> 00:46:00,523
<font color="yellow">It's me. Joon Soo's Mom.</font>

641
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:05,378
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo wanted to play with Yoon Woo.
I will be there soon.</font>

642
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:06,469

<font color="yellow">Oh, you are here.</font>

645
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:54,623
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

646
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:57,731

650
00:47:09,556 --> 00:47:11,663

to the Labor Administration</font>

653
00:47:25,713 --> 00:47:29,141
<font color="yellow">That's okay.
I was just feeling a bit down.</font>

654
00:47:53,009 --> 00:47:54,818
<font color="yellow">Did you wait long?</font>

655
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:58,005
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

- No, I will go home with him.</font>

I can understand you seeing him.</font>

You look pretty today.</font>

732
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:38,460
<font color="yellow">That's so cool. Half fried and
half seasoned spicy chicken.</font>

733
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,389
<font color="yellow"><i>I was scared.</i></font>

734
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:52,630
<font color="yellow">Whenever we fought, I brought up the
things he did wrong in the past.</font>

735
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,027
<font color="yellow">We kept on hurting each other
over things that</font>

736
00:54:55,027 --> 00:55:00,123
<font color="yellow">had happened in the past.</font>

737
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:05,418
<font color="yellow">When I realized that I was not nice
enough to forget about the past...</font>

738
00:55:05,418 --> 00:55:08,880
<font color="yellow">that's when I decided to divorce him.</font>

739
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,637
<font color="yellow"><i>Whether you force yourself to forget it
or you eventually forget about it...</i></font>

740
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:16,032
<font color="yellow"><i>That's what divorce is for.</i></font>

741
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:23,619
<font color="yellow">If I think of it that way,
I'm happy that I got divorced.</font>

742
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:27,346
<font color="yellow">So did you get him
completely out of your mind?</font>

743
00:55:31,503 --> 00:55:35,289
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter.</font>

744
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:38,985
<font color="yellow">That has nothing to do with me anymore.</font>

745
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:42,050
<font color="yellow"><i>I got divorced because I didn't want
to go back to the past.</i></font>

746
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:46,137
<font color="yellow"><i>So there is no need to bring that back up
and try to forget about it.</i></font>

747
00:55:53,731 --> 00:55:56,262
<font color="yellow">Look straight ahead.</font>

748
00:55:56,262 --> 00:56:01,603
<font color="yellow">So  a divorced man and woman like us
just need to look straight ahead.</font>

749
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,880
<font color="yellow">- What do you think?
- What?</font>

750
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,907
<font color="yellow">Do you want to start a relationship?</font>

751
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,141
<font color="yellow">I'm actually asking you out on a date.</font>

752
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:18,478
<font color="yellow">It's not because
I don't want to eat alone.</font>

753
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,666
<font color="yellow"><i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me. Are you home?</font>

754
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:45,922
<font color="yellow">- What about Joon Soo?
- He took a bath and went to bed.</font>

755
00:56:45,922 --> 00:56:48,469
<font color="yellow"><i>Is Joon Soo doing well in school?</i></font>

756
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:50,168
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

757
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:51,702
<font color="yellow">Are you handling everything okay?</font>

758
00:56:51,702 --> 00:56:55,543
<font color="yellow">There's more things to
take care of in elementary school.</font>

759
00:56:55,543 --> 00:56:57,335
<font color="yellow">I'm ready for it.</font>

760
00:56:57,335 --> 00:56:59,230
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon, if it's too tough for you--</font>

761
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,766
<font color="yellow">- Joon Soo's Dad?
<i>- Yes?</i></font>

762
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:06,130
<font color="yellow">You don't have to feel sorry to me.</font>

763
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,677
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

764
00:57:07,677 --> 00:57:11,349
<font color="yellow"><i>I just wanted to tell you that.</i></font>

765
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:16,911
<font color="yellow"><i>I feel sorry to you whenever I see you.</i></font>

766
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:19,570
<font color="yellow"><i>So let's stop being sorry to each other.</i></font>

767
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:23,670
<font color="yellow">Let's be happy in our separate ways.</font>

768
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,635
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

769
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:38,954
<font color="yellow">Mom, the bathroom light went out.
It's dark in there.</font>

770
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:41,242
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

771
00:57:41,242 --> 00:57:44,409
<font color="yellow">I will call Dad and ask him
to get a new one.</font>

772
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:46,559
<font color="yellow">No, Joon Soo. I will do it.</font>

773
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,128
<font color="yellow">You can't do that.
Dad changed the living room light too.</font>

774
00:57:51,128 --> 00:57:54,693
<font color="yellow">No, I can do it.</font>

775
00:57:54,693 --> 00:57:58,376
<font color="yellow">I think I will have to do it from now on.</font>

776
00:58:24,088 --> 00:58:26,826
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello, this is Toycrane.</i></font>

777
00:58:26,826 --> 00:58:30,556
<font color="yellow"><i>I have an important meeting tomorrow.
What should I wear?</i></font>

778
00:58:30,556 --> 00:58:32,786
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you have a meeting with a woman?</i></font>

779
00:58:32,786 --> 00:58:34,978
<font color="yellow"><i>- Of course it's a woman.
- He said it's an "important meeting."</i></font>

780
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:37,815
<font color="yellow"><i>- Did you ever date anyone?
- Toycrane? That flirtatious wife?</i></font>

781
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:41,509
<font color="yellow"><i>Since Toycrane is single again,
he can date another person.</i></font>

782
00:58:41,509 --> 00:58:44,538
<font color="yellow">It's Toycrane.</font>

783
00:58:44,538 --> 00:58:46,304
<font color="yellow">It really is him. Is he going on a date?</font>

784
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:48,224
<font color="yellow">- I hope things work out for him.
- I envy him.</font>

785
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,003
<font color="yellow">Should I ask him to upload
pictures of his clothes?</font>

786
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:57,708
<font color="yellow">This is so lame.</font>

787
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:59,422
<font color="yellow"><i>She said it's lame.</i></font>

788
00:59:02,235 --> 00:59:06,574
<font color="yellow">Do you think those clothes
match your face?</font>

789
00:59:06,574 --> 00:59:08,597
<font color="yellow">Do you know Toycrane?</font>

790
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:13,704
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

791
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:15,306
<font color="yellow"><i>He said you look like a countryman.</i></font>

792
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:17,797
<font color="yellow"><i>She wants you to try wearing the
shirt you wore before</i></font>

793
00:59:17,797 --> 00:59:20,291
<font color="yellow"><i>and the third pair of pants.</i></font>

794
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:23,447
<font color="yellow">Tell him to post his address. I will go
buy some clothes and send them to him.</font>

795
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:25,766
<font color="yellow"><i>Your eyes look like fish eyes.</i></font>

796
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:27,463
<font color="yellow"><i>He says let's go to the Han River.</i></font>

797
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,570
<font color="yellow">What do they want me to do?</font>

798
00:59:48,447 --> 00:59:51,221
<font color="yellow">What about the baby?</font>

799
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:55,608
<font color="yellow">The baby is okay.
He said you don't have to worry.</font>

800
00:59:55,608 --> 00:59:58,661
<font color="yellow">Is the baby really okay?</font>

801
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,797
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

802
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:03,764
<font color="yellow">It's for real, right?</font>

803
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:06,067
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

804
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:08,081
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

805
01:00:11,217 --> 01:00:13,302
<font color="yellow">Then what was wrong with me?</font>

806
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:18,556
<font color="yellow">Due to the stress from being pregnant</font>

807
01:00:18,556 --> 01:00:21,827
<font color="yellow">and the sudden changes in your body</font>

808
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:25,782
<font color="yellow">you couldn't pass feces.</font>

809
01:00:25,782 --> 01:00:29,226
<font color="yellow">That's why that happened.</font>

810
01:00:33,148 --> 01:00:36,148
<font color="yellow">He said make sure to take laxatives
when you go home.</font>

811
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:44,056
<font color="yellow">Due to the stress from being pregnant...</font>

812
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:48,065
<font color="yellow">- You couldn't pass feces for a long--
- Okay.</font>

813
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:51,126
<font color="yellow">You couldn't pass feces
for a long time...</font>

814
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,143
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you.</font>

815
01:01:01,143 --> 01:01:03,608
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to die here.</font>

816
01:01:21,202 --> 01:01:25,141
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you didn't shoot me this time.</font>

817
01:01:25,141 --> 01:01:30,356
<font color="yellow">At least you don't die
from getting hit by a brick.</font>

818
01:01:30,356 --> 01:01:32,463
<font color="yellow"><i>Father.</i></font>

819
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:40,672
<font color="yellow">I know you don't want me
to stay by your side.</font>

820
01:01:40,672 --> 01:01:44,302
<font color="yellow">I admit it. I was being selfish</font>

821
01:01:44,302 --> 01:01:46,463
<font color="yellow">asking you to marry me just because
we have a baby.</font>

822
01:01:46,463 --> 01:01:48,088
<font color="yellow">Still.</font>

823
01:01:48,088 --> 01:01:50,677
<font color="yellow">I have parental rights too.</font>

824
01:01:50,677 --> 01:01:55,083
<font color="yellow">We could go to the hospital together or
something, let's raise the baby together.</font>

825
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:57,427
<font color="yellow">But how could you resign from work?</font>

826
01:01:57,427 --> 01:02:00,027
<font color="yellow">What should I do then? You said you are
going to quit work</font>

827
01:02:00,027 --> 01:02:02,554
<font color="yellow">and move to a new place.</font>

828
01:02:02,554 --> 01:02:05,063
<font color="yellow">I know you like your job
more than anything.</font>

829
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:08,570
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to give up
because of me.</font>

830
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:11,664
<font color="yellow">I will quit. There are a lot of companies
that want to work with me.</font>

831
01:02:11,664 --> 01:02:15,199
<font color="yellow">I stayed here because of you.</font>

832
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:18,858
<font color="yellow">Producer Ann, let me ask you a question.</font>

833
01:02:18,858 --> 01:02:20,985
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

834
01:02:20,985 --> 01:02:24,012
<font color="yellow">Do you have no feelings left for me?</font>

835
01:02:26,768 --> 01:02:28,625
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

836
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:33,911
<font color="yellow">My house has been sold. I think I will
have to move out tomorrow.</font>

837
01:02:33,911 --> 01:02:36,210
<font color="yellow">Please help me move out.</font>

838
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:40,753
<font color="yellow">Could you do that for the baby?</font>

839
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:43,489
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

840
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:45,704
<font color="yellow">Because I'm a biological father.</font>

841
01:02:55,387 --> 01:02:58,500
<font color="yellow">- You can follow me.
- Okay.</font>

842
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:05,643
<font color="yellow">- Where should I go?
- I will tell you.</font>

843
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:10,248
<font color="yellow">Turn right here.</font>

844
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,710
<font color="yellow">We are here.</font>

845
01:03:21,737 --> 01:03:24,755
<font color="yellow">This is where I will be living.</font>

846
01:03:24,755 --> 01:03:27,699
<font color="yellow">Do you really mean it?</font>

847
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:29,773
<font color="yellow">Sir, please start putting stuff in.</font>

848
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,027
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

849
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:38,530
<font color="yellow">- Are you really going to live here?
- Yes. Can I?</font>

850
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,760
<font color="yellow">I will leave if the owner says no.</font>

851
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,737
<font color="yellow">No. You can live here.</font>

852
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,704
<font color="yellow">But why all of a sudden...</font>

853
01:03:45,704 --> 01:03:47,302
<font color="yellow">It's not all of a sudden.</font>

854
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:49,228
<font color="yellow">I have been thinking about it.</font>

855
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:56,447
<font color="yellow">You should have told me ahead of time.
I could have got things ready for you.</font>

856
01:03:56,447 --> 01:04:00,143
<font color="yellow">It's so sudden... What should I do?</font>

857
01:04:00,143 --> 01:04:02,052
<font color="yellow">We have a lot of time.</font>

858
01:04:02,052 --> 01:04:07,364
<font color="yellow">- I should clean the house.
- You talk too much.</font>

859
01:04:07,364 --> 01:04:10,034
<font color="yellow">Where should I put my stuff.
Should I put it in that room?</font>

860
01:04:10,034 --> 01:04:12,088
<font color="yellow">No, not that room. Not that room...</font>

861
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:18,813
<font color="yellow">What do you mean "it's so sudden?"</font>

862
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:23,277
<font color="yellow">There is a baby store across the street.</font>

863
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:27,509
<font color="yellow">I started piling cute baby stuff up
and put them all here.</font>

864
01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:30,806
<font color="yellow">- That's how this happened.
- Then you should have just bought one.</font>

865
01:04:30,806 --> 01:04:33,822
<font color="yellow">We don't know if we are
having a boy or a girl.</font>

866
01:04:33,822 --> 01:04:35,876
<font color="yellow">- It's a girl.
- Oh, it's a girl.</font>

867
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:39,382
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- It's a girl?</font>

868
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:41,909
<font color="yellow">It's a girl?</font>

869
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:44,521
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- Are you that happy?</font>

870
01:04:44,521 --> 01:04:46,264
<font color="yellow">I thought about this all the time.</font>

871
01:04:46,264 --> 01:04:48,666
<font color="yellow">If I have a daughter, I will get
pretty dresses for her</font>

872
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:52,150
<font color="yellow">and the two of us could sneak out
and eat ice cream together.</font>

873
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,146
<font color="yellow">And teach her how to ride a bike...</font>

874
01:04:54,146 --> 01:04:56,030
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give her
rides to school every day.</font>

875
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,157
<font color="yellow">I will be so jealous
if she finds a boyfriend.</font>

876
01:04:58,157 --> 01:05:00,262
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about that...</font>

877
