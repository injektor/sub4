<font color="yellow"><i>(This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up)</i></font>

2
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,537
<font color="yellow">I have nowhere to go in
a nice suit like this.</font>

3
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:37,637
<font color="yellow">You've become a manager now.
We should celebrate.</font>

4
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:39,973
<font color="yellow">I signed the contract for
"War Terminator", too.</font>

5
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,867
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin, congratulations on your promotion.</font>

6
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:43,467
<font color="yellow">Treat us sometime.</font>

7
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:44,767
<font color="yellow">You're a real manager now.</font>

8
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:46,237
<font color="yellow">Get me some jobs.</font>

9
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:47,797
<font color="yellow">I'm looking forward, too.</font>

10
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:50,837
<font color="yellow">The only change is the name of my position.</font>

11
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:52,697
<font color="yellow">It means Eun Gab recognized your ability.</font>

12
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,657
<font color="yellow">You worked so hard to get me the role.</font>

13
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,797
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. Mr. Kim doesn't mean it.</font>

14
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:59,218
<font color="yellow">He'll continue calling me Cup Noodles.
Just wait and see.</font>

15
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:02,297
<font color="yellow">This is how you should look in a suit.</font>

16
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:04,897
<font color="yellow">Look at me. Don't I look just amazing?</font>

17
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:07,667
<font color="yellow">Don't I look like an Italian?</font>

18
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:10,567
<font color="yellow">No, you look like a waiter.</font>

19
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:11,997
<font color="yellow">One steak, please.</font>

20
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:14,437
<font color="yellow">Look at yourself. With
such narrow shoulders,</font>

21
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,443
<font color="yellow">you look like a student
activist from the 70s.</font>

22
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:20,337
<font color="yellow">Your face looks like that of
an old man from the 19th century.</font>

23
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,297
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

24
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,867
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't get a new suit.</font>

25
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:26,767
<font color="yellow">Why would you need it when you have no job?</font>

26
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,037
<font color="yellow">Are you going to wear it
on your internet show?</font>

27
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,267
<font color="yellow">You're insulting a million
unemployed people out there.</font>

28
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:33,297
<font color="yellow">I really didn't want to bring this up.</font>

29
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:37,036
<font color="yellow">The "erection on the set" incident.</font>

30
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:38,637
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Stop it.</font>

31
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:40,357
<font color="yellow">It was a historical incident.</font>

32
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,267
<font color="yellow">It's so embarrassing that
it never even gets published.</font>

33
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:44,337
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

34
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,537
<font color="yellow">That never happened.</font>

35
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,507
<font color="yellow">He was supposed to act angry.</font>

36
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:52,643
<font color="yellow">But a certain body part got angry instead.</font>

37
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,797
<font color="yellow">It gets angry whenever he's angry.</font>

38
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,467
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, don't buy him a suit.</font>

39
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,036
<font color="yellow">- Why do you decide?
- I'm his cousin.</font>

40
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,537
<font color="yellow">That sounded so childish.</font>

41
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:03,337
<font color="yellow">Do you have a problem?</font>

42
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:07,267
<font color="yellow">You promised him to buy him
Michael Lau's artworks, right?</font>

43
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:09,507
<font color="yellow">Yes, Turtle loves them.</font>

44
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:12,197
<font color="yellow">You can't.</font>

45
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:14,173
<font color="yellow">If you buy him those,
I'll stop cooking for you guys.</font>

46
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,037
<font color="yellow">- You guys clean the house.
- Why?</font>

47
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,667
<font color="yellow">What should we do? He sounds serious.</font>

48
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:20,697
<font color="yellow">You're one petty waiter.</font>

49
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,137
<font color="yellow">When will my steak be served?</font>

50
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:26,337
<font color="yellow">Fine. Do you want to go
and have some steak?</font>

51
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:28,437
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

52
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:30,237
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

53
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:34,997
<font color="yellow">What's the point of getting a new suit?
I'm always at home.</font>

54
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,297
<font color="yellow">I know. You shouldn't
call yourself an actor.</font>

55
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:38,797
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

56
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,837
<font color="yellow">Look at that car.</font>

57
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:45,397
<font color="yellow">Who parks his car like this?</font>

58
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,597
<font color="yellow">We can still get out.</font>

59
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,437
<font color="yellow">Wait. We should teach this jerk a lesson.</font>

60
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,897
<font color="yellow">- What a jerk!
- Stop it.</font>

61
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,267
<font color="yellow">I'll call him.</font>

62
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,166
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
- Let me do this.</font>

63
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,397
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

64
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,737
<font color="yellow">Let me call him instead.</font>

65
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,697
<font color="yellow">Get off me.</font>

66
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:02,637
<font color="yellow"><i>(YOUNG BIN)</i></font>

67
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,697
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling me?</font>

68
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,397
<font color="yellow">Can you move your car?</font>

69
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:07,997
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

70
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:10,237
<font color="yellow">This car is yours.</font>

71
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:12,097
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

72
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,637
<font color="yellow">You're a success.</font>

73
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,237
<font color="yellow">You've come a long way.</font>

74
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,237
<font color="yellow">It's a present from me.</font>

75
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:22,637
<font color="yellow">Now that you're a manager,
you need a new car.</font>

76
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:27,097
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't deserve it.</font>

77
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:28,957
<font color="yellow">I already signed the contract.
Just take it.</font>

78
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,067
<font color="yellow">Pay me back when you become rich.</font>

79
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,867
<font color="yellow">Just take it.</font>

80
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,667
<font color="yellow">If you don't take it, I'll take it.</font>

81
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,797
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Wait.</font>

82
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,937
<font color="yellow">You're smiling ear to ear.</font>

83
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,343
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- You're almost bleeding.</font>

84
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,667
<font color="yellow">- I'll drive.
- Look at you.</font>

85
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,167
<font color="yellow">This car is so nice.</font>

86
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:55,137
<font color="yellow">Did Turtle get in the other
car because he's angry at me?</font>

87
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,066
<font color="yellow">He has a good reason.</font>

88
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,667
<font color="yellow">He'd been so excited about those artworks.</font>

89
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:02,566
<font color="yellow">I feel so great. That serves him right.</font>

90
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:03,837
<font color="yellow">You're so childish.</font>

91
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,267
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows Young Bin is your cousin.</font>

92
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,067
<font color="yellow">The caller ID is unknown?</font>

93
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:11,057
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you could still do this.</font>

94
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,266
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Is this Mr. Cha Joon?</font>

95
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,397
<font color="yellow">This is a film company.</font>

96
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,097
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is the one-of-a-kind actor,</font>

97
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:20,197
<font color="yellow">- Cha Joon.
- Gosh.</font>

98
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:23,037
<font color="yellow">I'm calling you regarding
our upcoming movie.</font>

99
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,937
<font color="yellow">Are you offering me an audition?</font>

100
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,337
<font color="yellow">I'm the assistant director.
I'd like to cast you without an audition.</font>

101
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,137
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

102
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:34,567
<font color="yellow">You are the assistant director.</font>

103
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:37,697
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's the movie about?</font>

104
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:39,537
<font color="yellow">It's an action movie.</font>

105
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,437
<font color="yellow">The shooting starts next month.</font>

106
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:43,597
<font color="yellow">An action movie?</font>

107
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,667
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

108
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,497
<font color="yellow">Could you tell me the title of it?</font>

109
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,137
<font color="yellow">It's called, "Angry Men".</font>

110
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:58,667
<font color="yellow">"Angry Men"?</font>

111
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:00,697
<font color="yellow">It sounds funny.</font>

112
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:02,737
<font color="yellow">The movie is about...</font>

113
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,037
<font color="yellow">a competition between angry men.</font>

114
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,597
<font color="yellow">Are you concerned about something?</font>

115
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:10,267
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

116
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,297
<font color="yellow">Which role will I be playing?</font>

117
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:14,867
<font color="yellow">The aroused man.</font>

118
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:19,197
<font color="yellow">The aroused man?</font>

119
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,237
<font color="yellow">It's an important role.</font>

120
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:25,797
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

121
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,867
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure I can do it well.</font>

122
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,767
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- The aroused man.</font>

123
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,067
<font color="yellow">It's an action movie.</font>

124
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,767
<font color="yellow">"Angry Men".</font>

125
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:45,037
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

126
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,637
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

127
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,337
<font color="yellow">I tried to stop him, I swear.</font>

128
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:52,067
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Go.</font>

129
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,137
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

130
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,797
<font color="yellow">Did we get too aggressive last time?</font>

131
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,597
<font color="yellow">I don't remember well.</font>

132
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:06,867
<font color="yellow">No, we didn't.</font>

133
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:08,867
<font color="yellow">I don't remember well, either,</font>

134
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,987
<font color="yellow">but if I had been really angry,
it wouldn't have stopped there.</font>

135
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:13,937
<font color="yellow">I wasn't serious, either.</font>

136
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:17,537
<font color="yellow">If you had crossed the line,
I would have made it clear.</font>

137
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:19,967
<font color="yellow">I know. We were quite cute.</font>

138
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,267
<font color="yellow">You were kinder than I had expected.</font>

139
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,537
<font color="yellow">What did you do to the
director, by the way?</font>

140
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:26,637
<font color="yellow">He really didn't like the idea at first.</font>

141
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,397
<font color="yellow">Did I miss anything?</font>

142
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,497
<font color="yellow">You're very skillful.</font>

143
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,837
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

144
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:36,237
<font color="yellow">He probably saw that I was genuine.</font>

145
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,937
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is a great actor.</font>

146
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:41,137
<font color="yellow">You wanted to make a contract with us,</font>

147
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,537
<font color="yellow">but you backed out when
the director objected.</font>

148
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,167
<font color="yellow">I'm very impressed.</font>

149
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:50,037
<font color="yellow">No production companies care
so much about directors' opinions.</font>

150
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:52,867
<font color="yellow">I'm done.</font>

151
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,243
<font color="yellow">The contract has been made.
I hope we'll stay on good terms.</font>

152
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,667
<font color="yellow">We should. We're on the same boat now.</font>

153
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:03,267
<font color="yellow">Who else will be in the movie?</font>

154
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:06,767
<font color="yellow">Who will play the supporting role?</font>

155
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,567
<font color="yellow">It's giving me a headache.</font>

156
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,737
<font color="yellow">We're talking with Kang
Ha Neul at the moment.</font>

157
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:12,897
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Kang Ha Neul?</font>

158
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:16,897
<font color="yellow">Is he good?</font>

159
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:24,437
<font color="yellow">Didn't Kang Ha Neul...</font>

160
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:26,397
<font color="yellow">have a scandal with An So Hee?</font>

161
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,797
<font color="yellow">There's something fishy.</font>

162
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,937
<font color="yellow">Why would he play a supporting role?</font>

163
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:33,367
<font color="yellow">- He's played main roles.
- I wonder that, too.</font>

164
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,197
<font color="yellow">The role is too small for him,
and he even had a scandal.</font>

165
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,367
<font color="yellow">Can you ask around?</font>

166
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,896
<font color="yellow">Sure, Mr. Lee. I'll ask around.</font>

167
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:42,097
<font color="yellow">You already have so much to care about.</font>

168
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,367
<font color="yellow">I heard you bought Ho Jin a car.</font>

169
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,867
<font color="yellow">He's a real manager now.</font>

170
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:48,737
<font color="yellow">His car was so old.</font>

171
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:51,866
<font color="yellow">He's too dorky to have such a fancy car.</font>

172
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:54,137
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- That's why he needs a nice car.</font>

173
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:55,197
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

174
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:58,236
<font color="yellow">Anyway, An So Hee signed the contract.</font>

175
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,643
<font color="yellow">The main actor and actress are decided now.</font>

176
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,337
<font color="yellow">Really? That's great.</font>

177
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:03,473
<font color="yellow">- You look so happy.
- Is there something going on?</font>

178
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,637
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- You brats.</font>

179
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,937
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

180
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,367
<font color="yellow">- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?</font>

181
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:13,667
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

182
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:17,767
<font color="yellow">Can't I get a role in "War Terminator"?</font>

183
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,937
<font color="yellow">Please ask them if there's a role for him.</font>

184
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:25,407
<font color="yellow">They hate it when a management company...</font>

185
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,667
<font color="yellow">tries to sell its actors in a bundle.</font>

186
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:30,597
<font color="yellow">I'll find you some auditions.</font>

187
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,067
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

188
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:34,697
<font color="yellow">Anyway, the contract has been signed.</font>

189
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:37,967
<font color="yellow">Now, focus on preparing for the shooting.</font>

190
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:39,797
<font color="yellow">- Help him.
- Okay.</font>

191
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:43,407
<font color="yellow">Stay red.</font>

192
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,967
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

193
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,767
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Your face.</font>

194
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,737
<font color="yellow">No surgery could save this.</font>

195
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,167
<font color="yellow">Take good care of it, okay?</font>

196
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,737
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Gosh. You should.</font>

197
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,097
<font color="yellow">I'll see you again.</font>

198
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:03,866
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is not in the position to
criticize someone else's looks.</font>

199
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:04,967
<font color="yellow">Right? That was...</font>

200
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,937
<font color="yellow">- Is he still angry?
- Joon!</font>

201
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:12,337
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

202
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,767
<font color="yellow"><i>(IT'S YOUNG BIN'S TREAT.)</i></font>

203
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:23,407
<font color="yellow">Aren't you coming with me?</font>

204
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,037
<font color="yellow">I'd be a third wheel. I'm not coming.</font>

205
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:27,167
<font color="yellow">I'm not coming, either.</font>

206
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,237
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you wait until
the shooting begins?</font>

207
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,947
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to let her
know the coffee is from me.</font>

208
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:36,237
<font color="yellow">Just admit you wanted to see So Hee.</font>

209
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:37,667
<font color="yellow">You're right. See you.</font>

210
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:42,967
<font color="yellow">He's wasting his time.</font>

211
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:45,037
<font color="yellow">Why is he so desperate?</font>

212
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:46,967
<font color="yellow">Should we go watch?</font>

213
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,697
<font color="yellow">We're not supposed to be here.</font>

214
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,213
<font color="yellow">I'm failing all the auditions, too.</font>

215
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:51,883
<font color="yellow">Then again, I guess you can't be on sets...</font>

216
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,067
<font color="yellow">after that incident.</font>

217
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:55,067
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin.</font>

218
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,707
<font color="yellow">Is there someone else than you here?</font>

219
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:58,767
<font color="yellow">- I'm hearing things.
- Gosh.</font>

220
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,097
<font color="yellow">Are you still angry?</font>

221
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,667
<font color="yellow">Why are you so petty?
You're almost 2m tall.</font>

222
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:03,797
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin, tell him.</font>

223
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:07,367
<font color="yellow">I don't want to have
a conversation with a kid.</font>

224
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:08,906
<font color="yellow">I regret not following Young Bin.</font>

225
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,137
<font color="yellow">I apologize, Joon.</font>

226
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:12,937
<font color="yellow">I'll set you up with a girl.</font>

227
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:14,797
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

228
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,496
<font color="yellow">You've been avoiding girls because of...</font>

229
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,937
<font color="yellow">what the fortune teller said, right?</font>

230
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,437
<font color="yellow">I'll find you a girl.</font>

231
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:23,767
<font color="yellow">- You know what type I like, right?
- I do.</font>

232
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:25,197
<font color="yellow">It never changes.</font>

233
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,057
<font color="yellow">- Ho Jin, do you want one, too?
- Forget it.</font>

234
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:29,037
<font color="yellow">He has Ji An.</font>

235
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,036
<font color="yellow">- What are you saying?
- A lovesick man who always...</font>

236
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:32,296
<font color="yellow">watches a girl's back.</font>

237
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,766
<font color="yellow">That was nice. Say it once again.</font>

238
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,267
<font color="yellow">A lovesick man who always
watches a girl's back.</font>

239
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:37,897
<font color="yellow">That was so nice. Say it one more time.</font>

240
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,596
<font color="yellow">- It's nice, right? A lovesick...
- Stop it now.</font>

241
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,597
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you don't know when to stop.</font>

242
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:45,267
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

243
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,767
<font color="yellow"><i>(AN SO HEE)</i></font>

244
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:21,697
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

245
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,067
<font color="yellow">We're friends from school.
This is Young Bin.</font>

246
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,867
<font color="yellow">I know who he is. I love your movies.</font>

247
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,337
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- You're doing great.</font>

248
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:37,737
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you.
- Okay.</font>

249
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,237
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

250
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:47,547
<font color="yellow">It seems like I interrupted you.</font>

251
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:50,197
<font color="yellow">You didn't. Sit down.</font>

252
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,237
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you
before we start shooting.</font>

253
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,697
<font color="yellow">- Maybe I came too early.
- It's okay.</font>

254
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,997
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the coffee.
Everyone looked so happy.</font>

255
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:10,337
<font color="yellow">You and Ha Neul...</font>

256
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,567
<font color="yellow">Should I call him Mr. Kang?</font>

257
00:12:14,937 --> 00:12:16,097
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you two seem close.</font>

258
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,067
<font color="yellow">We are.</font>

259
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:20,997
<font color="yellow">We used to date.</font>

260
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:26,137
<font color="yellow">When you asked me,
we had already broken up.</font>

261
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,537
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you we were just friends.</font>

262
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,667
<font color="yellow">- I didn't mean to lie.
- It's okay.</font>

263
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:36,497
<font color="yellow">He came to see me recently.</font>

264
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:39,717
<font color="yellow">He wants to get back together with me.</font>

265
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:41,997
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

266
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:43,966
<font color="yellow">getting back together?</font>

267
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:45,067
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure yet.</font>

268
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,597
<font color="yellow">I don't want to think
about anything else...</font>

269
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,567
<font color="yellow">until this drama is over.</font>

270
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:57,037
<font color="yellow">I heard Ha Neul might
be in "War Terminator".</font>

271
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:58,237
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

272
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:00,597
<font color="yellow">I think it's because of me.</font>

273
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:03,197
<font color="yellow">It's to get back together with me.</font>

274
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:08,797
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

275
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:10,497
<font color="yellow">Is it certain?</font>

276
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,737
<font color="yellow">Will Ha Neul take it? Why?</font>

277
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:16,267
<font color="yellow">How would I know? He
probably liked the script.</font>

278
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,767
<font color="yellow">Or the director.</font>

279
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,366
<font color="yellow">What is he thinking? What
did the director say?</font>

280
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,437
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me.</font>

281
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:23,937
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. You call me only when
you want something from me.</font>

282
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:29,537
<font color="yellow">Hey, I have tons of pictures
of your ex-girlfriend.</font>

283
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,036
<font color="yellow">I even have one where you kiss her.
Do you want it to spread?</font>

284
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,597
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

285
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,167
<font color="yellow">The director seems to be okay with it.</font>

286
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,567
<font color="yellow">That's all I know.</font>

287
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:38,996
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. Hang up.</font>

288
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,597
<font color="yellow">Why would you be busy?</font>

289
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:42,637
<font color="yellow">I'm the head of the team.</font>

290
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,637
<font color="yellow">Of course, you are.</font>

291
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:49,337
<font color="yellow">I'd like our investment
company to be more engaged.</font>

292
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,967
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let Ms. Jo run wild?</font>

293
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,367
<font color="yellow">The idea is almost like a co-investor.</font>

294
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:59,467
<font color="yellow">These days, management
companies have the most power.</font>

295
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:00,997
<font color="yellow">You're the boss.</font>

296
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,337
<font color="yellow">Cut it out.</font>

297
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:05,037
<font color="yellow">Why does everyone give me a
hard time if I'm one? Hang up.</font>

298
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:16,367
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- I started the meeting.</font>

299
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:17,837
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

300
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,736
<font color="yellow">I'm 4 minutes and 5 seconds
late, to be precise.</font>

301
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,367
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

302
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,967
<font color="yellow">I'm leading a meeting, don't you see?</font>

303
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,217
<font color="yellow">I'll attend meetings from now on.</font>

304
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,837
<font color="yellow">Stop interrupting the meeting.</font>

305
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:31,737
<font color="yellow">Sit over there.</font>

306
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:35,597
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

307
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:37,537
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

308
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:39,537
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

309
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:42,837
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

310
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,695
<font color="yellow">There's a rumor saying
that he slept with them.</font>

311
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,145
<font color="yellow">Is it a rumor or a fact?</font>

312
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:50,315
<font color="yellow">It seems like he did sleep
with a couple of them.</font>

313
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,075
<font color="yellow">It is exaggerated, though.</font>

314
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:54,248
<font color="yellow">It'll get published soon.</font>

315
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,374
<font color="yellow">Great job.</font>

316
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,414
<font color="yellow">Can't you do any better?</font>

317
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:00,913
<font color="yellow">Why do you blame me?</font>

318
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:03,544
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell him to be such a jerk.</font>

319
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,774
<font color="yellow">You're responsible for
managing your actors.</font>

320
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,944
<font color="yellow">You should have even used
violence to stop him.</font>

321
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:09,874
<font color="yellow">Who does that these days?</font>

322
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:12,414
<font color="yellow">These days, you can play go
or even sleep with a robot.</font>

323
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:16,474
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't beaten you up,
you would never have grown up.</font>

324
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,413
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Don't exaggerate it.</font>

325
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:22,144
<font color="yellow">You totally sound like an old lady.</font>

326
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,044
<font color="yellow">And you're so young, right?</font>

327
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:27,914
<font color="yellow">Think about how you used to be.</font>

328
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:31,244
<font color="yellow">Are you ashamed of your past
now that you're a director?</font>

329
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,114
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

330
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:36,374
<font color="yellow">Have you checked if you have Alzheimer's?</font>

331
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:37,914
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy.</font>

332
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:40,774
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't want to work.</font>

333
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,214
<font color="yellow">You said you were considering
taking a year off or retiring.</font>

334
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,214
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling greedy?</font>

335
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,274
<font color="yellow">Are you craving money?</font>

336
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:49,374
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

337
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:53,274
<font color="yellow">I dragged my old body here because
I couldn't stand your job.</font>

338
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:54,974
<font color="yellow">Do you get it now?</font>

339
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:57,874
<font color="yellow">Enjoy this.</font>

340
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:01,114
<font color="yellow">Did you see?</font>

341
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,844
<font color="yellow">She's crazy.</font>

342
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:05,114
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

343
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:07,114
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

344
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,294
<font color="yellow">You told me to water your plants.</font>

345
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:11,494
<font color="yellow">The meeting didn't take so long.</font>

346
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:15,014
<font color="yellow">How could we have a meeting
with a crazy woman?</font>

347
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,574
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Hey, be careful.</font>

348
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,474
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. I'll do it.</font>

349
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:21,814
<font color="yellow">I can't ask you to do anything.</font>

350
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:24,174
<font color="yellow">You're very nice to your plants.</font>

351
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:25,824
<font color="yellow">I wish you were that nice to me.</font>

352
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:27,344
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous?</font>

353
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:31,744
<font color="yellow">Say that to your boyfriend instead.</font>

354
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:34,974
<font color="yellow">Don't touch Young Bin.</font>

355
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:36,644
<font color="yellow">Young Bin?</font>

356
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,774
<font color="yellow">Move. Gosh.</font>

357
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:42,344
<font color="yellow">Young Bin?</font>

358
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,144
<font color="yellow">Don't touch it. This one is my treasure.</font>

359
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,874
<font color="yellow">Did you give your plants names?</font>

360
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:52,814
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

361
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,974
<font color="yellow">These are our most popular actors.</font>

362
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:58,874
<font color="yellow">What about the other actors?</font>

363
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:01,444
<font color="yellow">They don't have any plants.
They'll get one...</font>

364
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:05,044
<font color="yellow">when they become more popular.</font>

365
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:06,744
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

366
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:09,374
<font color="yellow">You're cute.</font>

367
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:10,944
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

368
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:12,974
<font color="yellow">It gave me goosebumps.</font>

369
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:14,814
<font color="yellow">Where? Down there?</font>

370
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:16,374
<font color="yellow">What kind of a girl says such a thing?</font>

371
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:19,014
<font color="yellow">You say it all the time.
Testicles, testicles,</font>

372
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:20,414
<font color="yellow">- testicles...
- Hey!</font>

373
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:23,974
<font color="yellow">Can't you stop saying that?</font>

374
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,344
<font color="yellow">At first, I didn't understand.</font>

375
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:27,844
<font color="yellow">I decide what I say.</font>

376
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:30,044
<font color="yellow">Get out. Stop talking.</font>

377
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,444
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anyone about my plants, okay?</font>

378
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:36,813
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll get a plant and name it Eun Gab.</font>

379
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:37,844
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

380
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:39,974
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

381
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,614
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim, I'm driving.
- Why is it so noisy?</font>

382
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,584
<font color="yellow">Are you still driving that junk?</font>

383
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:47,674
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

384
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:49,814
<font color="yellow">By the way, have you asked around?</font>

385
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:52,974
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

386
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:56,214
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

387
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,174
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

388
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,714
<font color="yellow">It seems like Ha Neul will do it.
The director likes him.</font>

389
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,044
<font color="yellow">Will you be acting with
So Hee's ex-boyfriend?</font>

390
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:07,744
<font color="yellow">It'll be so awkward.</font>

391
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:08,944
<font color="yellow">Is this a drama?</font>

392
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:12,813
<font color="yellow">It's terrible when your colleagues date.</font>

393
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:15,173
<font color="yellow">It's awkward when they fight.
This is not okay.</font>

394
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,244
<font color="yellow">Will you be all right?</font>

395
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:17,774
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

396
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:21,114
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the director and make a scene.</font>

397
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:23,144
<font color="yellow">That's a great idea. Should I make a turn?</font>

398
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:24,914
<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

399
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:26,444
<font color="yellow">What can I do now?</font>

400
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:27,674
<font color="yellow">I have no choice.</font>

401
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,874
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking about him.</font>

402
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:36,614
<font color="yellow">Are you finding me a girl or not?</font>

403
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:39,584
<font color="yellow">I showed pictures of you to girls,</font>

404
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:40,814
<font color="yellow">and everyone said no.</font>

405
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,474
<font color="yellow">They said you were ugly and old.</font>

406
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,314
<font color="yellow">One girl genuinely got angry with me.</font>

407
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:46,374
<font color="yellow">- I fought for you.
- Gosh.</font>

408
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,874
<font color="yellow">Likes attract likes.</font>

409
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,314
<font color="yellow">Everyone around you is weird.</font>

410
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,950
<font color="yellow">I know I don't usually
look good on pictures.</font>

411
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:55,274
<font color="yellow">You look much better on pictures.</font>

412
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:56,844
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

413
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,514
<font color="yellow">Keep your promise.</font>

414
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,144
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll get really angry.</font>

415
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:03,014
<font color="yellow">When are we going to stop?
Joon is driving me crazy.</font>

416
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:04,673
<font color="yellow">Why did you tag along in the first place?</font>

417
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,444
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to drive
it for the last time.</font>

418
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:09,114
<font color="yellow">We all feel attached to this car.</font>

419
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:12,344
<font color="yellow">Joon and I used to go
to auditions with this car.</font>

420
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:15,174
<font color="yellow">This car still works fine.</font>

421
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,414
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- What happened?</font>

422
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,014
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt that seriously?</font>

423
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:34,474
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so dusty.</font>

424
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,214
<font color="yellow">What? Does it feel like you're
saying goodbye to a girl?</font>

425
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:49,974
<font color="yellow">Kind of.</font>

426
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:52,174
<font color="yellow">I know that feeling.</font>

427
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,354
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

428
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:55,814
<font color="yellow">He does know that feeling.</font>

429
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,314
<font color="yellow">He's seen so many girls walk away from him.</font>

430
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:00,444
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

431
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:05,914
<font color="yellow">My phone is ringing.</font>

432
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:08,374
<font color="yellow">It really is.</font>

433
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:11,144
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

434
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:13,614
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

435
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:16,144
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be on my way.</font>

436
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:17,774
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

437
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:20,014
<font color="yellow">- Who was it?
- It was Eun.</font>

438
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,553
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hey.</font>

439
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,853
<font color="yellow">Men are all the same.</font>

440
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:44,552
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

441
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,553
<font color="yellow">It's a lingerie fashion show.</font>

442
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,553
<font color="yellow">Good thing I decided to follow you.</font>

443
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,653
<font color="yellow">You all followed Joon to his blind date?</font>

444
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:53,323
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

445
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:55,383
<font color="yellow">Wake up, Joon.</font>

446
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:56,883
<font color="yellow">Don't forget why you're here.</font>

447
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,353
<font color="yellow">What type of a woman is she?</font>

448
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,563
<font color="yellow">She's the marketing manager
of this lingerie brand.</font>

449
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:04,023
<font color="yellow">She's nice and pretty. Follow me.</font>

450
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:12,222
<font color="yellow">She must've hurt her head for
wanting to go on a date...</font>

451
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,683
<font color="yellow">with Joon judging by his picture.</font>

452
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:15,853
<font color="yellow">She must be into tall and bald guys.</font>

453
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:18,323
<font color="yellow">- Am I right?
- Sure.</font>

454
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:20,553
<font color="yellow">Let's go drink.</font>

455
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:25,853
<font color="yellow">Do something about him.</font>

456
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,983
<font color="yellow">Do what exactly?</font>

457
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:29,753
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

458
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:42,683
<font color="yellow">I heard...</font>

459
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,583
<font color="yellow">you do marketing.</font>

460
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,353
<font color="yellow">I do. Are you enjoying the show?</font>

461
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:49,883
<font color="yellow">I love it.</font>

462
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:52,223
<font color="yellow">I've never been to something
like this before.</font>

463
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,523
<font color="yellow">Do you really not have a boyfriend?</font>

464
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:56,593
<font color="yellow">You look like you'd be popular among men.</font>

465
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,553
<font color="yellow">- I'm busy with work.
- I see.</font>

466
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:03,483
<font color="yellow">By the way, you don't look
like Cha Young Bin at all.</font>

467
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:06,483
<font color="yellow">- I heard you guys are cousins.
- Well...</font>

468
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,053
<font color="yellow">We looked alike when we were kids.</font>

469
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,653
<font color="yellow">As we grew up,</font>

470
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:14,723
<font color="yellow">I turned more masculine.</font>

471
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:15,953
<font color="yellow">My physique...</font>

472
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:17,853
<font color="yellow">and everywhere else.</font>

473
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:20,683
<font color="yellow">Are your friends still here?</font>

474
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,223
<font color="yellow">Including Young Bin?</font>

475
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:25,783
<font color="yellow">Yes. They should be downstairs.</font>

476
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:28,399
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to send them away?</font>

477
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:30,983
<font color="yellow">No. They should stay.</font>

478
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,483
<font color="yellow">Everyone's excited with
Young Bin being here.</font>

479
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,593
<font color="yellow">Young Bin was the only person
on her mind in the first place.</font>

480
00:22:57,553 --> 00:23:00,283
<font color="yellow">She went on a date with me
so Young Bin would come to the show.</font>

481
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:02,483
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that.</font>

482
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:05,083
<font color="yellow">Even Eun thought she was into you.</font>

483
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:08,023
<font color="yellow">I was a gentleman to her
even when I found out.</font>

484
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:10,053
<font color="yellow">Are you that into her?</font>

485
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:13,083
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to cut you up?</font>

486
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,823
<font color="yellow">- There's a last resort.
- What?</font>

487
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:18,723
<font color="yellow">We should update your profile on 2km
saying you're the actor Cha Joon.</font>

488
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:20,183
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

489
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:24,153
<font color="yellow">What's so wrong about dating apps?</font>

490
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:27,353
<font color="yellow">It's just an innocent social meet
up between a man and a woman.</font>

491
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,643
<font color="yellow">Do you think women will like him?</font>

492
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:32,783
<font color="yellow">He'll get a few calls from
the fans of Sugar Boys.</font>

493
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:37,123
<font color="yellow">- You think so?
- What are you so happy about?</font>

494
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,522
<font color="yellow">I said I'm against it.</font>

495
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:40,323
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault when
the agency finds out.</font>

496
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:42,683
<font color="yellow">Look how he's changed after the promotion.</font>

497
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,259
<font color="yellow">He's the source of all evil.
He's the second Kim Eun Gab.</font>

498
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:47,083
<font color="yellow">I'm not taking any part in this.</font>

499
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:48,359
<font color="yellow">You're going to an exhibition tomorrow.</font>

500
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:50,723
<font color="yellow">- Jung Woo's painting exhibition?
- Yes.</font>

501
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,583
<font color="yellow">I think So Hee will be there, too.</font>

502
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,253
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

503
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:57,513
<font color="yellow">What's that reaction?
I thought you'd be happier.</font>

504
00:23:58,323 --> 00:23:59,323
<font color="yellow">I am happy.</font>

505
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:01,423
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

506
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,423
<font color="yellow">That's it?</font>

507
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,153
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Aren't you eating?</font>

508
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,423
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bed.</font>

509
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,723
<font color="yellow">There he goes again with
the An So Hee virus.</font>

510
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:13,399
<font color="yellow">He always gets depressed
when he gets infected.</font>

511
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:14,553
<font color="yellow">I hope it's not contagious.</font>

512
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,383
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

513
00:25:00,823 --> 00:25:03,353
<font color="yellow">You're the one who scared me.</font>

514
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:05,353
<font color="yellow">It's late night.
I thought you were a mugger.</font>

515
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:08,223
<font color="yellow">Why would you be walking around
at night if you're so scared?</font>

516
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:09,853
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

517
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,183
<font color="yellow">- How did you know I was here?
- Isn't it obvious?</font>

518
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:15,353
<font color="yellow">You always sneak out at night
when you have a headache.</font>

519
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,083
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

520
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:18,953
<font color="yellow">I have a bad headache.</font>

521
00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:24,643
<font color="yellow">We should say we don't
want to work with Ha Neul.</font>

522
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,183
<font color="yellow">- To whom?
- To Mr. Kim.</font>

523
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:31,823
<font color="yellow">Or even the director or So Hee.</font>

524
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:36,123
<font color="yellow">- I don't like the idea.
- Sure, you don't.</font>

525
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:40,822
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be able to stay in the
same room with my girl's ex.</font>

526
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,083
<font color="yellow">Let alone for a few months.</font>

527
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:45,123
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

528
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:47,383
<font color="yellow">That'll be so frustrating.</font>

529
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,722
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest. He only wants to
do the movie because of So Hee.</font>

530
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:57,083
<font color="yellow">He's not normal.</font>

531
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:00,923
<font color="yellow">I wanted to do the movie
for the same reason.</font>

532
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,153
<font color="yellow">You're not normal either.</font>

533
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,223
<font color="yellow">Why are actors so abnormal?</font>

534
00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:08,183
<font color="yellow">Why would they pick love over work?</font>

535
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:12,553
<font color="yellow">My disappointment grows bigger
everyday I work as a manager.</font>

536
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:16,829
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing at me?
Do you think this is funny?</font>

537
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:17,883
<font color="yellow">Should I cry, then?</font>

538
00:26:20,823 --> 00:26:21,883
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine.</font>

539
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:25,123
<font color="yellow">I looked at the scripts and
I won't be working with him that much.</font>

540
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:26,993
<font color="yellow">I'll just have to deal with it.</font>

541
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:29,783
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure you'll be all right?
- No,</font>

542
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:32,683
<font color="yellow">but I still have to make an effort.</font>

543
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:36,353
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm dating
So Hee at the moment.</font>

544
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:39,983
<font color="yellow">Whether they start seeing
each other again or not,</font>

545
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,953
<font color="yellow">it's none of my business.</font>

546
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,553
<font color="yellow">That's awfully professional of you.</font>

547
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:47,423
<font color="yellow">You should try it sometimes.</font>

548
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:50,853
<font color="yellow">I'm always professional.</font>

549
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:53,983
<font color="yellow"><i>(HA JUNG WOO PRIVATE EXHIBITION)</i></font>

550
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:04,783
<font color="yellow">Young Jun.</font>

551
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:06,723
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Young Bin.</font>

552
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:09,723
<font color="yellow">- Are you here for the exhibition?
- Yes.</font>

553
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,453
<font color="yellow">I've seen it already, but
I'm not so sure about it.</font>

554
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,183
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

555
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:17,783
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

556
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,953
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Kang Ha Neul next to So Hee?</font>

557
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:35,583
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

558
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,523
<font color="yellow">- Let's go home.
- What?</font>

559
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:41,653
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

560
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:47,853
<font color="yellow">The pleasure is ours.</font>

561
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:51,483
<font color="yellow">I think Yoo Bin really wants to...</font>

562
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:54,353
<font color="yellow">improve and be better.</font>

563
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,653
<font color="yellow">What did you think?</font>

564
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:59,623
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but you'll have
to excuse me for a moment.</font>

565
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:02,023
<font color="yellow">- I'm really sorry.
- Excuse me.</font>

566
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:14,653
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

567
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:16,552
<font color="yellow">Can you talk right now, Mr. Kim?</font>

568
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:17,653
<font color="yellow">Make it short.</font>

569
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:19,423
<font color="yellow">About Kang Ha Neul.</font>

570
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:22,823
<font color="yellow">Is it confirmed that he'll
be on "War Terminator"?</font>

571
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:28,183
<font color="yellow">That's what's bothering me too.</font>

572
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:29,553
<font color="yellow">It's not confirmed yet.</font>

573
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,383
<font color="yellow">Why? Is Young Bin against it?</font>

574
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:34,753
<font color="yellow">He's not exactly the problem,</font>

575
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,253
<font color="yellow">but So Hee is.</font>

576
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:38,822
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

577
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:41,104
<font color="yellow">The reason why Ha Neul wants
to do "War Terminator" is...</font>

578
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,223
<font color="yellow">because of So Hee.</font>

579
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,523
<font color="yellow">It looks like they're
still seeing each other.</font>

580
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:48,383
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake.</font>

581
00:28:48,553 --> 00:28:51,723
<font color="yellow">Since when did hooking up become
the purpose of doing movies?</font>

582
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:54,582
<font color="yellow">When actors start having intimate
relationships with each other,</font>

583
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,852
<font color="yellow">the same thing goes for staff
member on staff member...</font>

584
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:57,483
<font color="yellow">and actor on staff member,</font>

585
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,353
<font color="yellow">it'll most certainly ruin
the working environment.</font>

586
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,723
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, Young Bin has a crush on So Hee.</font>

587
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,783
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

588
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:08,253
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Did you say he likes So Hee?</font>

589
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:10,099
<font color="yellow">Aren't they just college friends?</font>

590
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,153
<font color="yellow">Young Bin likes So Hee.</font>

591
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,153
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about the
movie because of that.</font>

592
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:25,223
<font color="yellow">You should've told me earlier.</font>

593
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,483
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing it to me now?</font>

594
00:29:28,023 --> 00:29:29,723
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't have let him work with her.</font>

595
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:32,503
<font color="yellow">Is shooting a movie some third-rate drama?</font>

596
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,183
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to hook them up?</font>

597
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,353
<font color="yellow">Do you think a movie set is
some college frat party?</font>

598
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:43,483
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

599
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:46,023
<font color="yellow">Oh, my head.</font>

600
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:47,923
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

601
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:50,453
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

602
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:54,523
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

603
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:56,183
<font color="yellow">When did you get here?</font>

604
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:04,422
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this?</font>

605
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:06,659
<font color="yellow">I had a horrible experience from
a dating site 10 years ago.</font>

606
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:08,459
<font color="yellow">I think I heard this story before.
Did you not like her?</font>

607
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:10,803
<font color="yellow">Surprisingly, she was very hot
like she described herself.</font>

608
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:14,353
<font color="yellow">But she was too open-minded. She
asked me to buy her drinks...</font>

609
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:17,283
<font color="yellow">and came on to me like crazy.
I got scared and ran away.</font>

610
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:20,583
<font color="yellow">Oh, the good old days.</font>

611
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:23,083
<font color="yellow">Why would you run away, though?</font>

612
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:25,129
<font color="yellow">You saw the picture I sent you, right?</font>

613
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:27,753
<font color="yellow">- She's hot.
- I'm not running away this time.</font>

614
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:29,283
<font color="yellow">I'm open-minded now.</font>

615
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,623
<font color="yellow">Are you sure the picture
wasn't photo-shopped?</font>

616
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:35,552
<font color="yellow">Was the picture taken by her phone?</font>

617
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,623
<font color="yellow">Stop with the whining already.</font>

618
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:06,423
<font color="yellow">I watched all of your videos
back when you were an idol.</font>

619
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,023
<font color="yellow">I even watched your movies.</font>

620
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:10,283
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

621
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:11,653
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

622
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:14,783
<font color="yellow">you look much better in person.</font>

623
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:18,053
<font color="yellow">You flatter me.</font>

624
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:21,982
<font color="yellow">I get that a lot.</font>

625
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,023
<font color="yellow">You do, right?</font>

626
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:26,523
<font color="yellow">It's really strange.</font>

627
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:29,123
<font color="yellow">I'm so used to seeing you from videos.</font>

628
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:34,023
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

629
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:36,283
<font color="yellow">you're a really special person.</font>

630
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:38,353
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

631
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,853
<font color="yellow">I'm nothing special really.</font>

632
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:45,583
<font color="yellow">You must be close with many famous actors.</font>

633
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:46,922
<font color="yellow">Who are you friends with?</font>

634
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:48,953
<font color="yellow">I have friends here and there.</font>

635
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,323
<font color="yellow">Why is he calling me?</font>

636
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,183
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Is it a celebrity?</font>

637
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:02,923
<font color="yellow">It's someone called Kim Ki Bang.
He does a little acting.</font>

638
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:04,723
<font color="yellow">Can you excuse me for a second?</font>

639
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:08,753
<font color="yellow">Hi. What is it?</font>

640
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:13,453
<font color="yellow">You want to play pools
with someone like me?</font>

641
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:16,153
<font color="yellow">I thought you were busy spending
time with star celebrities.</font>

642
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:19,723
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, too. I'm with someone right now.</font>

643
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,953
<font color="yellow">You can come if you want.
Turtle's here, too.</font>

644
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,493
<font color="yellow">You know the place where
Lee Eun works, right?</font>

645
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:28,783
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

646
00:32:31,823 --> 00:32:32,923
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang's coming.</font>

647
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:35,753
<font color="yellow">Why did you invite him?
You're in the middle of a date.</font>

648
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:38,183
<font color="yellow">I want to show off my connections.</font>

649
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,523
<font color="yellow">Maybe I shouldn't have invited him.</font>

650
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:42,883
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang is all right.</font>

651
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:44,429
<font color="yellow">It's not like he's on
the same level as Young Bin.</font>

652
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:46,323
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

653
00:32:46,353 --> 00:32:48,553
<font color="yellow">He'll make me look good.</font>

654
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:50,883
<font color="yellow">You two aren't any different.</font>

655
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:53,723
<font color="yellow">The only difference is that you're taller.</font>

656
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:57,223
<font color="yellow">No way. He does make him look good.</font>

657
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:59,383
<font color="yellow">By 0.01mm.</font>

658
00:33:01,183 --> 00:33:03,464
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
I was born with better genes.</font>

659
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:06,082
<font color="yellow">He looks like a descendant of barbarians.</font>

660
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,353
<font color="yellow">I'm Young Bin's cousin.</font>

661
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:12,683
<font color="yellow">Did your standards become too high
from being around with Young Bin?</font>

662
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:15,253
<font color="yellow">You're delusional.</font>

663
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,153
<font color="yellow">How's the date going anyway?</font>

664
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:19,453
<font color="yellow">I think she's really into me.</font>

665
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,723
<font color="yellow">It's a bit overwhelming.</font>

666
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:23,753
<font color="yellow">She's gone crazy.</font>

667
00:33:24,123 --> 00:33:25,253
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's just you.</font>

668
00:33:26,183 --> 00:33:27,353
<font color="yellow">Everyone's gone crazy.</font>

669
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,153
<font color="yellow">I'm such a big fan.</font>

670
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:32,523
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

671
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,053
<font color="yellow">You look so much better in person.</font>

672
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:39,983
<font color="yellow">You look so tough and manly.</font>

673
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,753
<font color="yellow">- You're even sexy.
- What?</font>

674
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,353
<font color="yellow">Did you say I'm sexy?</font>

675
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:49,483
<font color="yellow">I do get that a lot these days.</font>

676
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:51,653
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang.</font>

677
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:53,823
<font color="yellow">Turtle's waiting for you.</font>

678
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,323
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Turtle.</font>

679
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:00,453
<font color="yellow">You should hang out with us.</font>

680
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:02,023
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

681
00:34:03,923 --> 00:34:05,482
<font color="yellow">Did I make you uncomfortable?</font>

682
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:07,283
<font color="yellow">It's nothing like that.</font>

683
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,053
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'll stick around for a while.</font>

684
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:15,983
<font color="yellow">- Is that okay?
- What?</font>

685
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:19,423
<font color="yellow">Of course. You can stay for a minute.</font>

686
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:21,853
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

687
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:23,623
<font color="yellow">Do you work out?</font>

688
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,983
<font color="yellow">Your biceps are so big.</font>

689
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:31,783
<font color="yellow">I did some working out for my role.
Can you tell?</font>

690
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:33,953
<font color="yellow">What about the chest?</font>

691
00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:36,022
<font color="yellow">Can I feel your chest a little?</font>

692
00:34:36,023 --> 00:34:37,583
<font color="yellow">My chest? Hold on.</font>

693
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:52,453
<font color="yellow">Jerk.</font>

694
00:34:59,983 --> 00:35:02,323
<font color="yellow">How can she pick Ki Bang over you?</font>

695
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:04,223
<font color="yellow">You got manhandled by a barbarian.</font>

696
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:06,323
<font color="yellow">Is it because he's well known?</font>

697
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:11,253
<font color="yellow">You have to tell Ki Bang to go home.</font>

698
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,523
<font color="yellow">I told you she's crazy.</font>

699
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:15,623
<font color="yellow">She's just happy to see celebrities.</font>

700
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:16,953
<font color="yellow">Even so.</font>

701
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,753
<font color="yellow">Why does he have to ruin my date?</font>

702
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:23,053
<font color="yellow">He was never the popular one among women.</font>

703
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:24,893
<font color="yellow">She said he's sexy.</font>

704
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:28,783
<font color="yellow">Stop whining and go back.</font>

705
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:30,783
<font color="yellow">You're going to scare off my customers.</font>

706
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:34,353
<font color="yellow">She's right. You can't just leave them be.</font>

707
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:37,523
<font color="yellow">I don't care any more.
They're crazy about each other.</font>

708
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:39,653
<font color="yellow">They've got their hands
all over each other.</font>

709
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:45,571
<font color="yellow">They shouldn't be doing that here.</font>

710
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,133
<font color="yellow">- No way.
- Hurry.</font>

711
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:54,148
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

712
00:35:56,878 --> 00:35:59,118
<font color="yellow">Something came up.</font>

713
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:01,718
<font color="yellow">I have to go now.</font>

714
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:04,018
<font color="yellow">- Me, too.
- I'm sorry.</font>

715
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:10,278
<font color="yellow">Did they do it?</font>

716
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:13,332
<font color="yellow">That scum.</font>

717
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,132
<font color="yellow">Did you see it?</font>

718
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:28,702
<font color="yellow">Can you talk to me?</font>

719
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:31,432
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

720
00:36:32,862 --> 00:36:34,182
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to talk?</font>

721
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:37,402
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you anything.
You'll just slip it right out.</font>

722
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:39,902
<font color="yellow">I told you. There was no other way.</font>

723
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:41,932
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

724
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,862
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to tell him I like So Hee?</font>

725
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:49,132
<font color="yellow">How are you planning on shooting
the film with those two?</font>

726
00:36:50,162 --> 00:36:51,702
<font color="yellow">You didn't even say hello to Jung Woo.</font>

727
00:36:51,832 --> 00:36:53,132
<font color="yellow">I was surprised.</font>

728
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:54,432
<font color="yellow">That was...</font>

729
00:36:56,572 --> 00:36:58,372
<font color="yellow">It's my problem. I'll
take care of it myself.</font>

730
00:36:59,732 --> 00:37:01,701
<font color="yellow">This isn't just your problem.
The whole movie is at stake.</font>

731
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:04,102
<font color="yellow">This is everyone's problem.
That's why I told Mr. Kim.</font>

732
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:06,972
<font color="yellow">You're completely on
his side now, aren't you?</font>

733
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:09,112
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you can solve
this problem on your own?</font>

734
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:10,262
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

735
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:13,002
<font color="yellow">Even I can't do anything about it.</font>

736
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,532
<font color="yellow">I talked to Mr. Kim just now.
He'll take care of it.</font>

737
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,262
<font color="yellow">That was quick.</font>

738
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:22,532
<font color="yellow">You two are basically partners now.</font>

739
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,032
<font color="yellow">What a perfect agency.</font>

740
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,032
<font color="yellow">I did this for you as a manager.</font>

741
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:27,478
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have, as my friend.</font>

742
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:31,071
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to be a good
manger or a good friend?</font>

743
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:32,072
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

744
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:35,462
<font color="yellow">You really have to pick your side.</font>

745
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,962
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

746
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,002
<font color="yellow">Either love or work. Pick
one and stick with it.</font>

747
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,232
<font color="yellow">When did you become so...</font>

748
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,332
<font color="yellow">Did you learn that one from Eun Gab?</font>

749
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:46,862
<font color="yellow">Put yourself in my shoes.</font>

750
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:48,901
<font color="yellow">How would you feel if
I babbled about you and Ji An?</font>

751
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,162
<font color="yellow">She's still here.</font>

752
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:55,732
<font color="yellow">- Am I interrupting?
- No.</font>

753
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,702
<font color="yellow">I'm done for today. I'll
come back tomorrow.</font>

754
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:01,072
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- I need to talk to you, Ji An.</font>

755
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:06,162
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin says...</font>

756
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:09,072
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Goodbye.</font>

757
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:12,962
<font color="yellow">He wants to have dinner with you.
Isn't that right, Ho Jin?</font>

758
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:15,862
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I can't tonight.</font>

759
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:19,932
<font color="yellow">By the way, my mom wants to have
dinner with you, Young Bin.</font>

760
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,661
<font color="yellow">You can refuse if you don't want to.</font>

761
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:23,432
<font color="yellow">Not at all. You'll be there, right?</font>

762
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:26,332
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

763
00:38:26,502 --> 00:38:28,732
<font color="yellow">You have to be there.</font>

764
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:31,232
<font color="yellow">You'd like it, too, right?</font>

765
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:33,072
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

766
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:35,032
<font color="yellow">So be it, then.</font>

767
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:37,662
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

768
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,402
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did it not go well?</font>

769
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:17,132
<font color="yellow">Why won't you tell us?</font>

770
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:18,732
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

771
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:20,462
<font color="yellow">Tell them.</font>

772
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:22,262
<font color="yellow">Don't get me started.</font>

773
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:23,708
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang stole her away from him.</font>

774
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:25,302
<font color="yellow">His date went to Ki Bang instead.</font>

775
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:28,662
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell them?
You're such a big mouth.</font>

776
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:30,162
<font color="yellow">Hear that?</font>

777
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:32,072
<font color="yellow">He called you a big mouth.</font>

778
00:39:32,102 --> 00:39:34,502
<font color="yellow">Stop it. When will you ever grow up?</font>

779
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:35,632
<font color="yellow">Did something go wrong?</font>

780
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:37,432
<font color="yellow">Turtle's asking.</font>

781
00:39:37,662 --> 00:39:39,382
<font color="yellow">Why don't you tell him with your big mouth?</font>

782
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,202
<font color="yellow">When Young Bin saw...</font>

783
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:44,432
<font color="yellow">So Hee and Ha Neul together
at the exhibition,</font>

784
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:46,202
<font color="yellow">he ran away.</font>

785
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,572
<font color="yellow">Is today Cha family's humiliation day?</font>

786
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:49,702
<font color="yellow">What happened next?</font>

787
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:53,302
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin called Eun Gab right away.</font>

788
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:54,602
<font color="yellow">Telling him that I like So Hee.</font>

789
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,132
<font color="yellow">He did that?</font>

790
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,732
<font color="yellow">Is that funny to you?</font>

791
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:01,132
<font color="yellow">- Ho Jin did the right thing.
- How?</font>

792
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,402
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

793
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,002
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'm a coward
and a small-minded person.</font>

794
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:10,102
<font color="yellow">So you do know. That's your strong forte.</font>

795
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:11,572
<font color="yellow">I should tell on you, too.</font>

796
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:13,702
<font color="yellow">To Mr. Kim?</font>

797
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:14,832
<font color="yellow">No, to Ms. Kang.</font>

798
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:17,432
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin is in love with
your daughter, Ms. Kang.</font>

799
00:40:18,202 --> 00:40:20,202
<font color="yellow">- That's hilarious.
- I know, right?</font>

800
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:23,662
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have dinner with
Ms. Kang. Do you want to join?</font>

801
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:25,502
<font color="yellow">You could get to know each other.</font>

802
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,302
<font color="yellow">I don't feel comfortable around her.</font>

803
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,842
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about me, anyway?</font>

804
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:32,602
<font color="yellow">I was hoping it didn't
have to come down to this.</font>

805
00:40:32,902 --> 00:40:34,232
<font color="yellow">Let's go Feeling Camping.</font>

806
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,072
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

807
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:37,362
<font color="yellow">This will get the job done.</font>

808
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,902
<font color="yellow">People start dating from this.</font>

809
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:43,462
<font color="yellow">Are you really going camping
instead of seeing Ms. Kang?</font>

810
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:45,362
<font color="yellow">I choose love over work.
Let's go right now.</font>

811
00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:48,502
<font color="yellow">And stop fighting, you two.
You can't even date girls.</font>

812
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:49,932
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

813
00:40:50,462 --> 00:40:51,462
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

814
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:54,502
<font color="yellow">Leave them be. They're all the same.</font>

815
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,662
<font color="yellow">They're losers, loners
and cowards acting tough.</font>

816
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:57,802
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

817
00:40:58,602 --> 00:40:59,732
<font color="yellow">This is Feeling Camping?</font>

818
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,332
<font color="yellow">Look at the pictures.</font>

819
00:41:04,702 --> 00:41:05,702
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

820
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:07,572
<font color="yellow">You're so much work.</font>

821
00:41:09,932 --> 00:41:11,362
<font color="yellow">Sit down and relax.</font>

822
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:37,962
<font color="yellow">Bravo.</font>

823
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,632
<font color="yellow">This is exciting.</font>

824
00:41:39,902 --> 00:41:41,072
<font color="yellow">Do we set up our tent here?</font>

825
00:41:41,162 --> 00:41:44,232
<font color="yellow">No. We have to go up higher in
the mountains where it's not so crowded.</font>

826
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:46,152
<font color="yellow">We'll be alone with the girls in the woods.</font>

827
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:47,942
<font color="yellow">That's what Feeling Camping is all about.</font>

828
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:50,002
<font color="yellow">Do we have to carry all this?</font>

829
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,962
<font color="yellow">Did you forget why we're here?</font>

830
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:54,862
<font color="yellow">- You're welcome to go back home.
- Okay, fine.</font>

831
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:56,882
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this, though?</font>

832
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:59,662
<font color="yellow">100 percent. They get all romantic here.</font>

833
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:01,908
<font color="yellow">Sitting around the bonfire
and staring into each other.</font>

834
00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:03,532
<font color="yellow">That's where it all starts.</font>

835
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:08,001
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have a girlfriend again?</font>

836
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:09,838
<font color="yellow">- It's a mystery.
- It's because you're jobless.</font>

837
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,532
<font color="yellow">That's right. We have that in common.</font>

838
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,601
<font color="yellow">I'm not jobless. I'm an actor.</font>

839
00:42:13,602 --> 00:42:16,002
<font color="yellow">You are jobless. And I'm the better one.</font>

840
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:17,232
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

841
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:19,273
<font color="yellow">I'm just jobless, but you're
ugly, old and jobless.</font>

842
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:21,778
<font color="yellow">You look like one of the salamanders
that live in the mountains.</font>

843
00:42:21,802 --> 00:42:23,978
<font color="yellow">You'll be thanking me by
the time we're heading back home.</font>

844
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,732
<font color="yellow">You'll be calling me "Sir". Call me "Sir".</font>

845
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:27,362
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
- Good boy.</font>

846
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:32,402
<font color="yellow">Bring them out.</font>

847
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:42,902
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

848
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,562
<font color="yellow">This is crazy.</font>

849
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:48,402
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to carry all of them?</font>

850
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:08,662
<font color="yellow">I never knew there was a
place like this in Korea.</font>

851
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:10,302
<font color="yellow">I've never seen anything like that.</font>

852
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:11,762
<font color="yellow">What happened here?</font>

853
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:19,262
<font color="yellow">I'm a nature man.</font>

854
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:21,502
<font color="yellow">The aroused man.</font>

855
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:58,632
<font color="yellow">How much longer do we have to go?</font>

856
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:00,782
<font color="yellow">I didn't come here to climb.</font>

857
00:44:02,502 --> 00:44:03,932
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

858
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:07,082
<font color="yellow">This place looks good enough.
Do you want to set up camp here?</font>

859
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:08,232
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

860
00:44:17,832 --> 00:44:20,362
<font color="yellow">Joon. Set up the camp already.</font>

861
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:22,262
<font color="yellow">- I need to rest for a bit.
- No.</font>

862
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:26,702
<font color="yellow">It'll get dark soon. The women
won't come up here then.</font>

863
00:44:27,202 --> 00:44:28,232
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

864
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:31,962
<font color="yellow">Let's get working.</font>

865
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:45,532
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

866
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:49,402
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I'm doing all the work.</font>

867
00:44:49,732 --> 00:44:51,862
<font color="yellow">You're such a whiner.</font>

868
00:44:52,362 --> 00:44:54,302
<font color="yellow">I'm doing the most important job.</font>

869
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:57,432
<font color="yellow">I'm uploading pictures on
my social media accounts.</font>

870
00:44:58,132 --> 00:44:59,962
<font color="yellow">Take a look. See?</font>

871
00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:02,062
<font color="yellow">Do you see what's happening as we speak?</font>

872
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:03,702
<font color="yellow">- See what?
- Don't you see it?</font>

873
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:06,101
<font color="yellow">"Where are you?", "Where is that?",
"Where are you right now?"</font>

874
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:07,778
<font color="yellow">"I'll be there soon",
"I'm taking the cab there."</font>

875
00:45:07,802 --> 00:45:09,901
<font color="yellow">- 10 comments already.
- Tell them to get over here quick.</font>

876
00:45:09,902 --> 00:45:11,782
<font color="yellow">- I told you I'd do you good.
- You were right.</font>

877
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:14,402
<font color="yellow">Don't call too many people over.</font>

878
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:15,932
<font color="yellow">We only have four chairs.</font>

879
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:18,232
<font color="yellow">We should get 400 to 500 people over.</font>

880
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:21,031
<font color="yellow">200 will be swimming over there
and the other 200 will be over there.</font>

881
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:23,201
<font color="yellow">The rest 100 will be holding
candles by the fire...</font>

882
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:24,761
<font color="yellow">crying, telling stories and all that.</font>

883
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:26,802
<font color="yellow">- Feeling Camping.
- That's what I'm talking about.</font>

884
00:45:29,562 --> 00:45:32,832
<font color="yellow">I'll get a handkerchief
ready to wipe their tears.</font>

885
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:34,132
<font color="yellow">Go set up the tent.</font>

886
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:48,032
<font color="yellow">This is the famous yellow corvina
from Beopsungpo.</font>

887
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:50,032
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

888
00:45:51,202 --> 00:45:52,202
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

889
00:45:55,862 --> 00:45:58,262
<font color="yellow">I wanted to feed you
some home-made cooking.</font>

890
00:45:59,002 --> 00:46:00,231
<font color="yellow">I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I?</font>

891
00:46:00,232 --> 00:46:01,302
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

892
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,302
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin probably feels at home.</font>

893
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:05,002
<font color="yellow">Like he's with his mother-in-law.</font>

894
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:08,702
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay, Manager Lee?
- I'm fine.</font>

895
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:12,302
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. Here you go. Eat up, Manager Lee.</font>

896
00:46:12,462 --> 00:46:13,502
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Here.</font>

897
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:15,062
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

898
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:17,832
<font color="yellow">You have...</font>

899
00:46:18,702 --> 00:46:19,962
<font color="yellow">a beautiful house.</font>

900
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:21,562
<font color="yellow">It's my daughter's work.</font>

901
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,932
<font color="yellow">I didn't even pay for it.</font>

902
00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:25,632
<font color="yellow">Ji An's running late.</font>

903
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:27,802
<font color="yellow">She said she'd come early.</font>

904
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,632
<font color="yellow">Speaking of the devil.</font>

905
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:34,102
<font color="yellow">- Sorry, I'm late.
- Hello.</font>

906
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:35,862
<font color="yellow">We started without you.</font>

907
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:37,532
<font color="yellow">Go bring your food.</font>

908
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:40,102
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right back.</font>

909
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:42,762
<font color="yellow">Can you bring some more
vegetables on your way back?</font>

910
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:44,102
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

911
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,732
<font color="yellow">You should go help her, Ho Jin.</font>

912
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:48,302
<font color="yellow">You should.</font>

913
00:46:51,232 --> 00:46:52,362
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come?</font>

914
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:55,502
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

915
00:46:58,262 --> 00:46:59,832
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

916
00:47:01,362 --> 00:47:02,431
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

917
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:04,472
<font color="yellow">- You should try some, too.
- Don't worry about me.</font>

918
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,192
<font color="yellow">- It's uncomfortable, isn't it?
- What?</font>

919
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:18,502
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

920
00:47:18,862 --> 00:47:21,532
<font color="yellow">She's always been good to me.
The food is delicious, too.</font>

921
00:47:23,262 --> 00:47:25,232
<font color="yellow">- She's a good cook.
- I see.</font>

922
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:27,262
<font color="yellow">- Strange, right?
- Yes.</font>

923
00:47:28,502 --> 00:47:29,562
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

924
00:47:30,132 --> 00:47:33,162
<font color="yellow">It feels like my mom's cooking. I love it.</font>

925
00:47:33,462 --> 00:47:35,432
<font color="yellow">Joon's a good cook, too,</font>

926
00:47:36,402 --> 00:47:38,683
<font color="yellow">but his food isn't quite my style.
It doesn't have depth.</font>

927
00:47:39,162 --> 00:47:40,232
<font color="yellow">I'm a good cook, too.</font>

928
00:47:42,732 --> 00:47:43,762
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

929
00:47:44,302 --> 00:47:46,732
<font color="yellow">- You don't believe me?
- I do.</font>

930
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:48,632
<font color="yellow">I'm just like my mom.</font>

931
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:51,002
<font color="yellow">I don't do housekeeping,
but I'm a good cook.</font>

932
00:47:51,062 --> 00:47:52,432
<font color="yellow">I'll cook for you some time.</font>

933
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:54,932
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

934
00:47:57,162 --> 00:47:58,162
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

935
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:00,932
<font color="yellow">- Shall we go?
- Yes.</font>

936
00:48:06,102 --> 00:48:08,032
<font color="yellow">Do you like this kind of alcohol?</font>

937
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:10,032
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to try some.</font>

938
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:12,662
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on landing
"War Terminator".</font>

939
00:48:12,702 --> 00:48:13,702
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

940
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:21,382
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to be in such a big movie?</font>

941
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:24,402
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd overwhelm me,</font>

942
00:48:25,132 --> 00:48:27,212
<font color="yellow">but I'm excited actually.
I'm looking forward to it.</font>

943
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:29,032
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

944
00:48:29,562 --> 00:48:31,562
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd make it when I first saw you.</font>

945
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,802
<font color="yellow">I had faith in you.</font>

946
00:48:35,532 --> 00:48:39,862
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab says he's the one who raised you,</font>

947
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:42,362
<font color="yellow">but I've always known.</font>

948
00:48:43,402 --> 00:48:46,002
<font color="yellow">I'm always grateful for Eun Gab.</font>

949
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,932
<font color="yellow">You're a loyal man.</font>

950
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,162
<font color="yellow">I like that.</font>

951
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:56,208
<font color="yellow">Has it been four years since
we've been working together?</font>

952
00:48:56,232 --> 00:48:58,702
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- You're a fourth grader.</font>

953
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:02,502
<font color="yellow">In the 5th grade,
you'll win a domestic award or 2.</font>

954
00:49:03,362 --> 00:49:05,832
<font color="yellow">In the sixth grade, you'll go to Cannes.</font>

955
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:07,962
<font color="yellow">Cannes?</font>

956
00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:10,902
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

957
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:14,502
<font color="yellow">You'll make a fortune like
Kim Soo Hyun and Jang Keun Suk.</font>

958
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:16,862
<font color="yellow">There will be a building
under your name as well.</font>

959
00:49:22,732 --> 00:49:25,032
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab doesn't even drink any more.</font>

960
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:28,632
<font color="yellow">He has strong will. He's no fun.</font>

961
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:33,132
<font color="yellow">Should we...</font>

962
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,362
<font color="yellow">start working together just the two of us?</font>

963
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:39,962
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

964
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:43,802
<font color="yellow">I'm just kidding.</font>

965
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:46,362
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

966
00:50:07,662 --> 00:50:08,802
<font color="yellow">You're here early.</font>

967
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:11,662
<font color="yellow">I came on time.
You're the one who came late.</font>

968
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:13,432
<font color="yellow">You didn't order any drinks?</font>

969
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:15,278
<font color="yellow">I don't drink any more. Order for yourself.</font>

970
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:16,582
<font color="yellow">I will when everyone else comes.</font>

971
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:18,232
<font color="yellow">Is this where you hang out often?</font>

972
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:19,902
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's nice, isn't it?</font>

973
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:22,162
<font color="yellow">Not really. I prefer somewhere quieter.</font>

974
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:24,922
<font color="yellow">I have an appointment soon,
so I'll get to the point.</font>

975
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,908
<font color="yellow">You don't want Kang Ha Neul
being in the movie?</font>

976
00:50:26,932 --> 00:50:28,932
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Why not? I don't understand.</font>

977
00:50:29,032 --> 00:50:30,402
<font color="yellow">He's the one I don't understand.</font>

978
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:31,962
<font color="yellow">He has no reason to do this movie.</font>

979
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:33,402
<font color="yellow">The director approves.</font>

980
00:50:33,632 --> 00:50:35,002
<font color="yellow">He won't.</font>

981
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,832
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

982
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:39,502
<font color="yellow">You know he's dating An So Hee.</font>

983
00:50:40,262 --> 00:50:41,432
<font color="yellow">Is there proof?</font>

984
00:50:41,702 --> 00:50:43,401
<font color="yellow">- You know.
- I don't.</font>

985
00:50:43,402 --> 00:50:45,062
<font color="yellow">Of course you do.</font>

986
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:48,102
<font color="yellow">So you want him out?</font>

987
00:50:48,402 --> 00:50:50,231
<font color="yellow">The leading roles in an
intimate relationship...</font>

988
00:50:50,232 --> 00:50:52,202
<font color="yellow">will ruin the work environment.</font>

989
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:53,362
<font color="yellow">You've seen it happen.</font>

990
00:50:53,462 --> 00:50:55,662
<font color="yellow">But I still want him on the movie.</font>

991
00:51:02,532 --> 00:51:05,001
<font color="yellow">His agency invested in your funds, right?</font>

992
00:51:05,002 --> 00:51:06,682
<font color="yellow">That's why you're agreeing to their terms.</font>

993
00:51:07,302 --> 00:51:08,732
<font color="yellow">He's past his prime now.</font>

994
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,202
<font color="yellow">- We should rule him out.
- What if I disagree?</font>

995
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:12,662
<font color="yellow">Manager Kim of CJ Entertainment...</font>

996
00:51:13,262 --> 00:51:16,662
<font color="yellow">and the CEO of An So Hee's agency
are waiting for me nearby.</font>

997
00:51:16,732 --> 00:51:19,052
<font color="yellow">We're going to meet up and
persuade the director together.</font>

998
00:51:21,732 --> 00:51:24,961
<font color="yellow">Look at the eyes of the shark.
They look empty of emotions.</font>

999
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:26,262
<font color="yellow">Scary, isn't it?</font>

1000
00:51:27,102 --> 00:51:29,632
<font color="yellow">Don't go see the director.
Kang Ha Neul is out of the picture.</font>

1001
00:51:29,832 --> 00:51:31,832
<font color="yellow">That's some sensible thinking.</font>

1002
00:51:32,062 --> 00:51:33,201
<font color="yellow">And from now on,</font>

1003
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:35,201
<font color="yellow">you don't have a say in the casting.
That's my job.</font>

1004
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:36,662
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm busy, too.</font>

1005
00:51:37,502 --> 00:51:38,502
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

1006
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:41,432
<font color="yellow">You're really not drinking.
You're awfully strong willed.</font>

1007
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:43,102
<font color="yellow">That's so boring.</font>

1008
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:44,922
<font color="yellow">I want to pluck out the eyes of that shark.</font>

1009
00:51:45,532 --> 00:51:46,732
<font color="yellow">That's a female shark, right?</font>

1010
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:48,662
<font color="yellow">I'll go now.</font>

1011
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:59,532
<font color="yellow">Hello? Are you with Young Bin?</font>

1012
00:51:59,632 --> 00:52:01,462
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Tell him this.</font>

1013
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:02,802
<font color="yellow">Kang Ha Neul is out.</font>

1014
00:52:02,902 --> 00:52:04,562
<font color="yellow">It's all taken care of.</font>

1015
00:52:04,762 --> 00:52:06,062
<font color="yellow">Really? How?</font>

1016
00:52:06,362 --> 00:52:08,062
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

1017
00:52:08,402 --> 00:52:09,432
<font color="yellow">Where's Young Bin?</font>

1018
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:12,002
<font color="yellow">He's with Ms. Kang now.</font>

1019
00:52:12,732 --> 00:52:13,761
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

1020
00:52:13,762 --> 00:52:15,462
<font color="yellow">She invited him over to her place.</font>

1021
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,962
<font color="yellow">He's having dinner with her.</font>

1022
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:19,231
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me this just now?</font>

1023
00:52:19,232 --> 00:52:21,331
<font color="yellow">You're telling everything late.</font>

1024
00:52:21,332 --> 00:52:22,508
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting so worked up?</font>

1025
00:52:22,532 --> 00:52:24,732
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it was important
enough to tell you.</font>

1026
00:52:24,902 --> 00:52:26,032
<font color="yellow">You drive me crazy.</font>

1027
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:28,162
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

1028
00:52:32,662 --> 00:52:33,702
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

1029
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,902
<font color="yellow">Did she shred a dried fish
by hand and make food for him?</font>

1030
00:52:37,962 --> 00:52:39,262
<font color="yellow">My gosh. How did you know?</font>

1031
00:52:43,162 --> 00:52:44,262
<font color="yellow">So he's there now, right?</font>

1032
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:45,962
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

1033
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:09,962
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

1034
00:53:10,602 --> 00:53:11,602
<font color="yellow">No reason.</font>

1035
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:14,862
<font color="yellow">They left.</font>

1036
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,062
<font color="yellow">Let's talk inside.</font>

1037
00:53:17,202 --> 00:53:19,762
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can't visit you.
I used to come by all the time.</font>

1038
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:21,932
<font color="yellow">You haven't been here since
you became successful.</font>

1039
00:53:22,932 --> 00:53:24,702
<font color="yellow">I know. Let's just talk inside.</font>

1040
00:53:31,102 --> 00:53:32,132
<font color="yellow"><i>(RICE CRACKER)</i></font>

1041
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:33,631
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

1042
00:53:33,632 --> 00:53:36,002
<font color="yellow">You like rice crackers.
You used to eat this every day.</font>

1043
00:53:37,832 --> 00:53:39,302
<font color="yellow">I don't eat it these days.</font>

1044
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:41,652
<font color="yellow">I mean, there are so many delicious things.</font>

1045
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:43,202
<font color="yellow">You've changed.</font>

1046
00:53:43,462 --> 00:53:44,932
<font color="yellow">You're the one who has changed.</font>

1047
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:48,702
<font color="yellow">You're condescending and
disrespectful towards me now.</font>

1048
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:51,562
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you and your foul mouth.</font>

1049
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:55,102
<font color="yellow">When was I condescending to you?
We just have different opinions.</font>

1050
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:56,912
<font color="yellow">Right, we think differently now.</font>

1051
00:53:57,932 --> 00:53:59,132
<font color="yellow">Very differently, in fact.</font>

1052
00:54:02,962 --> 00:54:04,242
<font color="yellow">Why did you meet with Young Bin?</font>

1053
00:54:04,562 --> 00:54:06,922
<font color="yellow">I can't even meet with an actor
in my agency as the co-CEO?</font>

1054
00:54:07,062 --> 00:54:09,832
<font color="yellow">You should've either given me
a heads-up or let me join.</font>

1055
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:12,742
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking as if I have
some sort of a hidden agenda?</font>

1056
00:54:12,862 --> 00:54:15,632
<font color="yellow">You did the same thing when you
stole actors from other agencies.</font>

1057
00:54:16,802 --> 00:54:19,078
<font color="yellow">You invited them over to
your place for the dried fish dish...</font>

1058
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:20,382
<font color="yellow">and made cheonggukjang for them.</font>

1059
00:54:20,602 --> 00:54:23,162
<font color="yellow">What is on your mind these days?</font>

1060
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:25,432
<font color="yellow">You tried to sell the company,
came to our meeting,</font>

1061
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,102
<font color="yellow">and met with Young Bin secretly.</font>

1062
00:54:27,462 --> 00:54:29,032
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking? Tell me.</font>

1063
00:54:29,802 --> 00:54:30,802
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

1064
00:54:32,462 --> 00:54:33,542
<font color="yellow">Do you think the company...</font>

1065
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:36,062
<font color="yellow">is yours?</font>

1066
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,732
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1067
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:39,702
<font color="yellow">It's ours.</font>

1068
00:54:41,032 --> 00:54:42,831
<font color="yellow">You worked hard to lay foundation for it,</font>

1069
00:54:42,832 --> 00:54:45,152
<font color="yellow">and I've been working like
a dog to grow it, so it's ours.</font>

1070
00:54:52,462 --> 00:54:53,502
<font color="yellow">It's mine.</font>

1071
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:55,962
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1072
00:54:56,232 --> 00:54:57,932
<font color="yellow">Go home before I let my dog off its leash.</font>

1073
00:55:03,032 --> 00:55:04,032
<font color="yellow">It's yours?</font>

1074
00:55:17,332 --> 00:55:19,162
<font color="yellow">- Are you tired?
- Yes.</font>

1075
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:22,802
<font color="yellow">I was so uncomfortable there.</font>

1076
00:55:23,662 --> 00:55:24,742
<font color="yellow">You probably felt the same.</font>

1077
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:26,708
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was a little uncomfortable, too.</font>

1078
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:28,062
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang was there,</font>

1079
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:30,232
<font color="yellow">and Ji An was there, too.</font>

1080
00:55:31,802 --> 00:55:32,802
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1081
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,562
<font color="yellow">About Ms. Kang.</font>

1082
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:39,402
<font color="yellow">I was weirded out by what she said.</font>

1083
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,832
<font color="yellow">I was stressed out because
of what you said.</font>

1084
00:55:43,932 --> 00:55:45,608
<font color="yellow">- Why? I didn't even say much.
- Whatever.</font>

1085
00:55:45,632 --> 00:55:47,352
<font color="yellow">You're the one who told Eun Gab everything.</font>

1086
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,992
<font color="yellow">- Why aren't you saying anything?
- I don't want to talk to you.</font>

1087
00:55:56,232 --> 00:55:57,592
<font color="yellow">You just have to get even with me.</font>

1088
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:59,832
<font color="yellow">All right. I won't be like that.
You stop it, too.</font>

1089
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:03,562
<font color="yellow">You don't have to work with
Ha Neul any more. It worked out.</font>

1090
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:07,042
<font color="yellow">Still, I don't feel that great.</font>

1091
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:09,872
<font color="yellow">Right. They're going out,
so I get why you're down.</font>

1092
00:56:11,962 --> 00:56:14,202
<font color="yellow">- What can you do, though?
- You're right.</font>

1093
00:56:15,932 --> 00:56:16,932
<font color="yellow">I'm aware of it.</font>

1094
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:18,173
<font color="yellow">So Hee is our friend, you know.</font>

1095
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,201
<font color="yellow">Her dating someone outside of our circle...</font>

1096
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:21,761
<font color="yellow">shouldn't really upset us that much...</font>

1097
00:56:21,762 --> 00:56:22,762
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1098
00:56:23,432 --> 00:56:24,832
<font color="yellow">Just say, "Cheer up, friend."</font>

1099
00:56:25,362 --> 00:56:26,842
<font color="yellow">Can't you try to make me feel better?</font>

1100
00:56:26,902 --> 00:56:28,422
<font color="yellow">What was that about? That was so cold.</font>

1101
00:56:28,532 --> 00:56:29,532
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

1102
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:31,462
<font color="yellow">Friend.</font>

1103
00:56:33,132 --> 00:56:35,032
<font color="yellow">Cheer up. We have to work hard, you know.</font>

1104
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,502
<font color="yellow">- You're my manager, indeed.
- Of course I am.</font>

1105
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,802
<font color="yellow">Joon and Turtle must be having fun.
They haven't even called.</font>

1106
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:47,162
<font color="yellow">You're right. Shall I try calling them?</font>

1107
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,532
<font color="yellow"><i>(YOUNG BIN)</i></font>

1108
00:56:52,232 --> 00:56:53,802
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's Young Bin.</font>

1109
00:56:55,902 --> 00:56:56,902
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

1110
00:56:58,002 --> 00:57:01,562
<font color="yellow">What do you think?
The two of us are just camping out here.</font>

1111
00:57:01,662 --> 00:57:02,732
<font color="yellow">Just the two of you?</font>

1112
00:57:04,832 --> 00:57:06,732
<font color="yellow">No one came because it's too far.</font>

1113
00:57:06,962 --> 00:57:09,202
<font color="yellow">About 400 mosquitos are keeping us company.</font>

1114
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:12,108
<font color="yellow">Turtle insisted that we should
camp inside the mountain,</font>

1115
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:14,302
<font color="yellow">so even the ones who came
all the way here left.</font>

1116
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,108
<font color="yellow">You love to blame other
people for everything.</font>

1117
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:17,172
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- Give it to me.</font>

1118
00:57:17,762 --> 00:57:18,832
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

1119
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:22,102
<font color="yellow">Joon's mood swings are annoying me so much.</font>

1120
00:57:24,562 --> 00:57:26,232
<font color="yellow">Stop fighting and just come home.</font>

1121
00:57:27,802 --> 00:57:28,962
<font color="yellow">Thanks, you're the best.</font>

1122
00:57:29,662 --> 00:57:31,432
<font color="yellow">We'll go there, right? Let's go today.</font>

1123
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:33,262
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1124
00:57:33,962 --> 00:57:36,482
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's eat some instant noodles.
We'll be there soon.</font>

1125
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:38,132
<font color="yellow">Let's eat the noodles.</font>

1126
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:41,502
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You have to make it.</font>

1127
00:57:43,402 --> 00:57:46,532
<font color="yellow">Joon, I don't think anyone will come.
Let's give up.</font>

1128
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,132
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1129
00:57:49,862 --> 00:57:51,102
<font color="yellow">It'll take forever to clean up.</font>

1130
00:57:58,302 --> 00:58:01,062
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- There's too much meat left.</font>

1131
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:08,602
<font color="yellow">Where are we now?
Do you know where we're going?</font>

1132
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:10,332
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

1133
00:58:11,062 --> 00:58:13,343
<font color="yellow">The last time I went camping
was when I was a little boy.</font>

1134
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:16,132
<font color="yellow">I have no idea where we are right now.</font>

1135
00:58:16,662 --> 00:58:18,062
<font color="yellow">We have to stay calm and collected.</font>

1136
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:21,162
<font color="yellow">"Stay focused. Where do we have to go?"</font>

1137
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:22,872
<font color="yellow">Did I sound like the game character?</font>

1138
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,962
<font color="yellow">Which way do we have to go, seriously?</font>

1139
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:31,002
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I thought you were
Jun Kunimura. I want your autograph.</font>

1140
00:58:31,102 --> 00:58:32,162
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

1141
00:58:32,662 --> 00:58:34,532
<font color="yellow">Hey, shall we call 911?</font>

1142
00:58:35,132 --> 00:58:36,132
<font color="yellow">I'm an actor.</font>

1143
00:58:36,902 --> 00:58:38,108
<font color="yellow">They'll write articles about me.</font>

1144
00:58:38,132 --> 00:58:40,132
<font color="yellow">Actor? Whatever.
What do you want to do, then?</font>

1145
00:58:41,762 --> 00:58:43,162
<font color="yellow">Let's just sleep here...</font>

1146
00:58:44,032 --> 00:58:45,262
<font color="yellow">and go home tomorrow.</font>

1147
00:58:45,732 --> 00:58:48,832
<font color="yellow">That's crazy. There are over
400 frogs here. We can't sleep here.</font>

1148
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:53,262
<font color="yellow">Oh, my life.</font>

1149
00:58:53,962 --> 00:58:55,562
<font color="yellow">What on earth am I doing here?</font>

1150
00:58:56,932 --> 00:58:59,213
<font color="yellow">We don't even have sleeping bags.
What are we doing here?</font>

1151
00:59:00,062 --> 00:59:02,662
<font color="yellow">Joon. We won't be attacked
by wild animals, right?</font>

1152
00:59:06,962 --> 00:59:09,602
<font color="yellow">I'm seriously hoping that
a tiger shows up and takes you.</font>

1153
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:14,772
<font color="yellow">Is it because we're inside the mountain?
It's cold.</font>

1154
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:16,702
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1155
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:18,322
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me. You're disgusting.</font>

1156
00:59:19,132 --> 00:59:22,061
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so cold.
I'll turn around so that our backs touch.</font>

1157
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,222
<font color="yellow">This is more disgusting.
Get your bottom away from me.</font>

1158
00:59:24,702 --> 00:59:25,732
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

1159
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:34,602
<font color="yellow">Hey. You just heard that sound, right?</font>

1160
00:59:36,932 --> 00:59:37,961
<font color="yellow">What sound?</font>

1161
00:59:37,962 --> 00:59:40,902
<font color="yellow">What if there's a wild animal outside?
It could be a wild boar.</font>

1162
00:59:41,002 --> 00:59:44,262
<font color="yellow">Gosh, here we go again.
You're seriously so paranoid.</font>

1163
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:48,301
<font color="yellow">There must be something outside.</font>

1164
00:59:48,302 --> 00:59:50,802
<font color="yellow">Stop! Stop it seriously. I'm so scared!</font>

1165
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:02,262
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

1166
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:04,632
<font color="yellow">Let's get out of here...</font>

1167
01:00:05,832 --> 01:00:08,202
<font color="yellow">- and call 911.
- We can't do that.</font>

1168
01:00:09,632 --> 01:00:12,102
<font color="yellow">It could ruin my career as an actor.</font>

1169
01:00:13,432 --> 01:00:16,632
<font color="yellow">Joon, no one even knows you.
No one will write articles about this.</font>

1170
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:18,902
<font color="yellow">Still, we can't.</font>

1171
01:00:20,832 --> 01:00:21,832
<font color="yellow">Let's just sleep.</font>

1172
01:00:23,362 --> 01:00:24,731
<font color="yellow">Everything will be fine if we fall asleep.</font>

1173
01:00:24,732 --> 01:00:26,432
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold and scared.</font>

1174
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:54,402
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

1175
01:00:55,602 --> 01:00:56,602
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1176
01:00:57,502 --> 01:01:00,102
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here?
- I couldn't fall asleep.</font>

1177
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:04,662
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

1178
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,362
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

1179
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:10,682
<font color="yellow">I can trust you that
everything is fine, right?</font>

1180
01:01:11,462 --> 01:01:13,762
<font color="yellow">Honey. When we were dating,</font>

1181
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:16,232
<font color="yellow">you had a dog, right? The one
that lived for a long time.</font>

1182
01:01:16,602 --> 01:01:17,662
<font color="yellow">Arong?</font>

1183
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:21,632
<font color="yellow">That dog started throwing a hissy
fit when it got older, right?</font>

1184
01:01:22,202 --> 01:01:23,232
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1185
01:01:23,732 --> 01:01:25,278
<font color="yellow">It started when Arong turned 10 years old.</font>

1186
01:01:25,302 --> 01:01:27,338
<font color="yellow">She started throwing tantrums
and didn't even eat her food.</font>

1187
01:01:27,362 --> 01:01:29,902
<font color="yellow">She started biting me, too.
She was never like that before.</font>

1188
01:01:30,932 --> 01:01:32,612
<font color="yellow">I guess she changed because she got older.</font>

1189
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:36,432
<font color="yellow">- You mean Arong?
- She tried to bite me today.</font>

1190
01:01:41,062 --> 01:01:42,232
<font color="yellow">Shall I bite back?</font>

1191
01:01:43,732 --> 01:01:44,812
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

1192
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:48,732
<font color="yellow">Honey, you and Yoo Bin are
everything in my life.</font>

1193
01:01:49,402 --> 01:01:52,131
<font color="yellow">It must be a midlife crisis.
Shall I take you to a doctor?</font>

1194
01:01:52,132 --> 01:01:55,362
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
You just don't get it.</font>

1195
01:01:56,432 --> 01:01:59,002
<font color="yellow">- Just go in and sleep.
- You go in and sleep.</font>

1196
01:02:00,462 --> 01:02:01,802
<font color="yellow">- Turn off the TV.
- Okay.</font>

1197
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:04,332
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1198
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:27,502
<font color="yellow">Here. Try it. It's a little hot.</font>

1199
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,142
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to eat with us suddenly?</font>

1200
01:02:37,632 --> 01:02:39,832
<font color="yellow">Since when did we need a
reason to eat together?</font>

1201
01:02:40,002 --> 01:02:41,362
<font color="yellow">You usually don't eat lunch.</font>

1202
01:02:41,462 --> 01:02:43,001
<font color="yellow">Why are you treating us
to barbecue for lunch?</font>

1203
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:45,178
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this because I met with Ms.
Kang yesterday?</font>

1204
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:47,102
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

1205
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:48,602
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

1206
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:52,162
<font color="yellow">Just eat. Eat up, guys.
Tenderloin is the most tender.</font>

1207
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,202
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

1208
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:56,602
<font color="yellow">By the way, what did Ms. Kang say to you?</font>

1209
01:02:57,162 --> 01:02:59,923
<font color="yellow">Nothing much. She just said she's
looking forward to working with me.</font>

1210
01:03:00,062 --> 01:03:03,162
<font color="yellow">She's trying to win you over to
her side because you're popular.</font>

1211
01:03:03,732 --> 01:03:05,532
<font color="yellow">That dried fish dish was very delicious.</font>

1212
01:03:05,632 --> 01:03:07,392
<font color="yellow">She tore the fish into
small strips by hand.</font>

1213
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:10,432
<font color="yellow">She does that all the time.</font>

1214
01:03:10,862 --> 01:03:13,262
<font color="yellow">She does it for everyone.</font>

1215
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:14,802
<font color="yellow">She also made cheonggukjang, right?</font>

1216
01:03:15,002 --> 01:03:16,962
<font color="yellow">She uses that old trick
of hers over and over.</font>

1217
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:22,802
<font color="yellow">Here, eat this.</font>

1218
01:03:25,232 --> 01:03:26,262
<font color="yellow">What has gotten into you?</font>

1219
01:03:27,332 --> 01:03:30,232
<font color="yellow">I'm not used to it, either.
It's making me cringe, too.</font>

1220
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:31,832
<font color="yellow">You make your own wraps, then.</font>

1221
01:03:33,962 --> 01:03:34,962
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

1222
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:36,732
<font color="yellow">- Hey, guys.
- You made it.</font>

1223
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,038
<font color="yellow">Are you guys coming from the mountain?</font>

1224
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:40,061
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Hello.</font>

1225
01:03:40,062 --> 01:03:41,062
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

1226
01:03:44,632 --> 01:03:45,762
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Goodness.</font>

1227
01:03:46,432 --> 01:03:47,502
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare touch me.</font>

1228
01:03:48,402 --> 01:03:49,632
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

1229
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:51,532
<font color="yellow">You're the one who did it!</font>

1230
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:52,992
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- What's wrong?</font>

1231
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,902
<font color="yellow">You idiots, what are you doing right now?</font>

1232
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:56,322
<font color="yellow">Did you two have a fight or what?</font>

1233
01:03:56,362 --> 01:03:59,402
<font color="yellow">No, we didn't. I woke up at
night because I was too cold...</font>

1234
01:03:59,932 --> 01:04:02,231
<font color="yellow">and noticed that he was
hugging me from behind.</font>

1235
01:04:02,232 --> 01:04:03,731
<font color="yellow">His thing was touching my behind...</font>

1236
01:04:03,732 --> 01:04:05,832
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, seriously.
- Darn it!</font>

1237
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:08,101
<font color="yellow">Hey, tell the truth.</font>

1238
01:04:08,102 --> 01:04:10,178
<font color="yellow">You're the one who turned around
and had your back touch my...</font>

1239
01:04:10,202 --> 01:04:11,362
<font color="yellow">Stop it, seriously!</font>

1240
01:04:11,562 --> 01:04:13,331
<font color="yellow">You two went camping to meet girls.</font>

1241
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:15,931
<font color="yellow">Did you end up shooting
"Brokeback Mountain" instead or what?</font>

1242
01:04:15,932 --> 01:04:17,832
<font color="yellow">- "Brokeback Mountain".
- You piece of...</font>

1243
01:04:17,962 --> 01:04:19,202
<font color="yellow">- You little...
- Enough, guys.</font>

1244
01:04:19,562 --> 01:04:20,762
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you two...</font>

1245
01:04:21,262 --> 01:04:23,543
<font color="yellow">did something we should
be worried about inside the tent?</font>

1246
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:26,332
<font color="yellow">I respect your personal taste,</font>

1247
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:28,032
<font color="yellow">but don't go overboard, all right?</font>

1248
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:32,702
<font color="yellow">Did you hear what happened to So Hee?</font>

1249
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:35,542
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
- She got hospitalized...</font>

1250
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:37,902
<font color="yellow">in the middle of a shoot due to overwork.</font>

1251
01:04:40,362 --> 01:04:42,232
<font color="yellow">- When did that happen?
- Early this morning.</font>

1252
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:45,002
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm telling you this now?</font>

1253
01:04:45,602 --> 01:04:48,602
<font color="yellow">You must not visit her at the hospital.</font>

1254
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:51,212
<font color="yellow">Reporters are literally
camping out at the hospital.</font>

1255
01:04:51,402 --> 01:04:53,902
<font color="yellow">Just send her some flowers instead.</font>

1256
01:04:54,002 --> 01:04:55,962
<font color="yellow">Get Ho Jin to arrange it.
Get it delivered there.</font>

1257
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:00,362
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, Young Bin.</font>

1258
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:04,532
<font color="yellow">Both you and I know that you like her.</font>

1259
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,882
<font color="yellow">But other people can't know about it.</font>

1260
01:05:07,332 --> 01:05:09,638
<font color="yellow">It cannot get out of this circle.
It's our secret. Got it?</font>

1261
01:05:09,662 --> 01:05:10,832
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Got it.</font>

1262
01:05:11,432 --> 01:05:13,352
<font color="yellow">You saw how the director
treated Ha Neul, right?</font>

1263
01:05:13,762 --> 01:05:15,122
<font color="yellow">You can't afford to be distracted.</font>

1264
01:05:15,362 --> 01:05:18,362
<font color="yellow">You must focus on work, okay?
Just think about the film.</font>

1265
01:05:18,962 --> 01:05:20,432
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. That won't happen.</font>

1266
01:05:21,062 --> 01:05:22,062
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1267
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:24,532
<font color="yellow">- Hey, order more food.
- Okay.</font>

1268
01:05:24,762 --> 01:05:26,362
<font color="yellow">- What do you want to eat?
- Tenderloin.</font>

1269
01:05:26,662 --> 01:05:27,731
<font color="yellow">- Turn the grill on.
- Excuse me!</font>

1270
01:05:27,732 --> 01:05:29,102
<font color="yellow">Joon, Joon.</font>

1271
01:05:29,262 --> 01:05:31,331
<font color="yellow">- One more serving of this, please.
- Sure.</font>

1272
01:05:31,332 --> 01:05:32,862
<font color="yellow">- Not this one.
- Then what is it?</font>

1273
01:05:33,632 --> 01:05:36,302
<font color="yellow">Listen. You have to keep a
watchful eye on Young Bin.</font>

1274
01:05:37,362 --> 01:05:41,062
<font color="yellow">Do not let him visit
An So Hee at the hospital. Got it?</font>

1275
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:44,052
<font color="yellow">He'll probably go, though.
You know how Young Bin is.</font>

1276
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,162
<font color="yellow">- That's why I'm telling you this.
- You're right.</font>

1277
01:05:47,232 --> 01:05:50,062
<font color="yellow">Think about it.
A girl  he loves is hospitalized.</font>

1278
01:05:50,432 --> 01:05:51,678
<font color="yellow">How would he be feeling right now?</font>

1279
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:54,762
<font color="yellow">I'll start crying the minute I
hear that my wife is hospitalized.</font>

1280
01:05:55,532 --> 01:05:57,062
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to stop him.</font>

1281
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:00,962
<font color="yellow">Actors are not exactly the
most stable people, you know.</font>

1282
01:06:01,232 --> 01:06:02,562
<font color="yellow">They get serious mood swings.</font>

1283
01:06:02,602 --> 01:06:06,102
<font color="yellow">They're moody and sensitive.
They can be blunt, too.</font>

1284
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:09,062
<font color="yellow">They let it all out, and
that's when things blow up.</font>

1285
01:06:10,002 --> 01:06:12,662
<font color="yellow">Hence, you have to coddle and
treat him tenderly at all times.</font>

1286
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:14,902
<font color="yellow">- I will.
- Also, you have to call me...</font>

1287
01:06:14,962 --> 01:06:17,732
<font color="yellow">and let me know right away if
he has any dinner meetings.</font>

1288
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:21,402
<font color="yellow">I didn't think that meeting with
Ms. Kang would be a problem.</font>

1289
01:06:21,532 --> 01:06:23,462
<font color="yellow">Do you want to switch to
the rope she's holding?</font>

1290
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:25,802
<font color="yellow">That rope is rotten.</font>

1291
01:06:27,802 --> 01:06:30,562
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim. You're having problems with
Ms. Kang, aren't you?</font>

1292
01:06:31,102 --> 01:06:33,502
<font color="yellow">There are no problems.
It's just a power struggle.</font>

1293
01:06:34,062 --> 01:06:36,732
<font color="yellow">Even animals fight for hierarchy, you know.</font>

1294
01:06:37,002 --> 01:06:40,602
<font color="yellow">Whenever you talk about her, it
sounds like you really hate her.</font>

1295
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,002
<font color="yellow">I don't hate her.</font>

1296
01:06:45,262 --> 01:06:46,462
<font color="yellow">You know that she's my mentor.</font>

1297
01:06:47,432 --> 01:06:48,752
<font color="yellow">She taught me how to do my job...</font>

1298
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:50,432
<font color="yellow">and groomed me.</font>

1299
01:06:51,032 --> 01:06:53,732
<font color="yellow">She even made me the co-CEO,
so I'm grateful for her help.</font>

1300
01:06:57,332 --> 01:06:59,632
<font color="yellow">I know how to be grateful, you silly.</font>

1301
01:07:03,262 --> 01:07:05,462
<font color="yellow">- Why are you chuckling?
- Sorry, don't mind me.</font>

1302
01:07:06,062 --> 01:07:08,662
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You should learn
from me, all right?</font>

1303
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:10,732
<font color="yellow">I'm such a great textbook.</font>

1304
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:11,962
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm going to...</font>

1305
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:14,561
<font color="yellow">kill you if you stab me in the back later.</font>

1306
01:07:14,562 --> 01:07:16,282
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about all of a sudden?</font>

1307
01:07:16,602 --> 01:07:18,702
<font color="yellow">What's keeping you so busy?</font>

1308
01:07:18,762 --> 01:07:21,038
<font color="yellow">You don't even get jobs because
you're not a good lawyer.</font>

1309
01:07:21,062 --> 01:07:22,762
<font color="yellow">I just want to ask you something.</font>

1310
01:07:23,532 --> 01:07:26,102
<font color="yellow">You know that my agency
is incorporated, right?</font>

1311
01:07:26,802 --> 01:07:28,432
<font color="yellow">What can I do to dismiss the co-CEO?</font>

1312
01:07:29,872 --> 01:07:30,932
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1313
01:07:32,262 --> 01:07:33,372
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

1314
01:07:35,062 --> 01:07:38,231
<font color="yellow">I'm asking just in case.
Just in case I need to know.</font>

1315
01:07:38,232 --> 01:07:39,952
<font color="yellow">- Yes, go ahead.
- Shall I learn from this?</font>

1316
01:07:41,462 --> 01:07:43,232
<font color="yellow">That's correct. We co-own the agency.</font>

1317
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:46,932
<font color="yellow">That's his game plan.</font>

1318
01:07:54,962 --> 01:07:57,162
<font color="yellow">Look at that. This place
is filled with reporters.</font>

1319
01:07:57,662 --> 01:07:58,702
<font color="yellow">I see that.</font>

1320
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:03,313
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Mr. Kim practically
begged you not to visit her.</font>

1321
01:08:03,314 --> 01:08:04,794
<font color="yellow">If he finds out about this, I will...</font>

1322
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:07,754
<font color="yellow">He'll strangle my neck.</font>

1323
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:12,384
<font color="yellow">You know that I can keep a secret
unlike you. I won't tell him.</font>

1324
01:08:14,254 --> 01:08:16,374
<font color="yellow">There are so many reporters here.
How will you go in?</font>

1325
01:08:16,514 --> 01:08:17,584
<font color="yellow">Do you have any ideas?</font>

1326
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:20,332
<font color="yellow">I'll think of something.</font>

1327
01:08:20,992 --> 01:08:22,622
<font color="yellow">Let's just send her flowers.</font>

1328
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:24,922
<font color="yellow">Flowers?</font>

1329
01:08:25,992 --> 01:08:28,562
<font color="yellow">- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, I'm fine.</font>

1330
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:32,161
<font color="yellow">I didn't really have to get hospitalized,</font>

1331
01:08:32,162 --> 01:08:33,921
<font color="yellow">but people at my agency
made a big fuss about it.</font>

1332
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:35,022
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved to hear that.</font>

1333
01:08:35,562 --> 01:08:37,522
<font color="yellow">Young Bin ordered flowers
to be delivered to you.</font>

1334
01:08:37,662 --> 01:08:38,692
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

1335
01:08:39,122 --> 01:08:42,462
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can get deliveries
here because of security reasons.</font>

1336
01:08:45,022 --> 01:08:46,902
<font color="yellow">The delivery guy probably
left it in the lobby.</font>

1337
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:49,762
<font color="yellow">Okay. Tell me that I said thanks.</font>

1338
01:08:50,522 --> 01:08:51,562
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

1339
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:54,592
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

1340
01:08:55,862 --> 01:08:57,162
<font color="yellow">There's a delivery for you.</font>

1341
01:09:00,462 --> 01:09:02,162
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

1342
01:09:04,192 --> 01:09:06,122
<font color="yellow">- It's me.
- You totally surprised me.</font>

1343
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:08,832
<font color="yellow">How did you get in here?
No one is allowed in here.</font>

1344
01:09:08,892 --> 01:09:10,762
<font color="yellow">It was like shooting an adventure film.</font>

1345
01:09:11,062 --> 01:09:13,462
<font color="yellow">I came in through the back door
and gave reporters the slip.</font>

1346
01:09:13,522 --> 01:09:14,991
<font color="yellow">Then I had to show
my face to the staff here.</font>

1347
01:09:14,992 --> 01:09:16,738
<font color="yellow">I took photos with them and
gave them my autograph.</font>

1348
01:09:16,762 --> 01:09:18,692
<font color="yellow">You could get into deep trouble.</font>

1349
01:09:19,462 --> 01:09:21,622
<font color="yellow">What is all this?
You bought a huge bouquet.</font>

1350
01:09:21,692 --> 01:09:23,532
<font color="yellow">I heard you're sick and got worried.
Goodness.</font>

1351
01:09:24,192 --> 01:09:25,392
<font color="yellow">Why did you faint like that?</font>

1352
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:29,362
<font color="yellow">Well, I thought I was taking
good care of my health.</font>

1353
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,262
<font color="yellow">Hey, I've never gotten
flowers from a guy before.</font>

1354
01:09:34,992 --> 01:09:36,022
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

1355
01:09:36,592 --> 01:09:38,312
<font color="yellow">You should've asked your boyfriend for one.</font>

1356
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:41,762
<font color="yellow">Ha Neul and I broke up.</font>

1357
01:09:43,622 --> 01:09:44,622
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

1358
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,522
<font color="yellow">No specific reason. It just happened.</font>

1359
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:50,192
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

1360
01:09:50,922 --> 01:09:54,022
<font color="yellow">In what way? Health-wise
or about the breakup?</font>

1361
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:55,392
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

1362
01:09:55,922 --> 01:09:57,422
<font color="yellow">I feel fine physically,</font>

1363
01:09:57,892 --> 01:10:02,122
<font color="yellow">and I'm sure I'll be fine
with other things, too.</font>

1364
01:10:02,562 --> 01:10:03,562
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1365
01:10:03,862 --> 01:10:06,892
<font color="yellow">By the way, don't you have to get going?
I know that you're busy.</font>

1366
01:10:07,062 --> 01:10:08,302
<font color="yellow">I'm technically unemployed now.</font>

1367
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,922
<font color="yellow">I'll get going so that
you can get some rest.</font>

1368
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:13,598
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin is waiting for me in the car, too.</font>

1369
01:10:13,622 --> 01:10:16,361
<font color="yellow">My gosh. He called me and
pretended to be elsewhere.</font>

1370
01:10:16,362 --> 01:10:18,092
<font color="yellow">I must say, he has become a real manager.</font>

1371
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:20,262
<font color="yellow">Hey, he got a promotion.</font>

1372
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:22,222
<font color="yellow">- He got a promotion?
- Yes.</font>

1373
01:10:22,522 --> 01:10:25,332
<font color="yellow">Then we should grab a drink
and celebrate together.</font>

1374
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,192
<font color="yellow">Shall we grab a beer?</font>

1375
01:10:28,332 --> 01:10:29,592
<font color="yellow">I really want to drink now.</font>

1376
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:32,762
<font color="yellow">Let's get together for drinks
when my drama is over.</font>

1377
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:34,661
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking about drinking?
You're sick.</font>

1378
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:35,662
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1379
01:10:36,122 --> 01:10:38,492
<font color="yellow">I haven't had any drinks
in such a long time.</font>

1380
01:10:38,762 --> 01:10:40,522
<font color="yellow">I've been staying away
from drinking lately.</font>

1381
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:42,292
<font color="yellow">We'll go out, right?</font>

1382
01:10:44,262 --> 01:10:45,562
<font color="yellow">I should get going now.</font>

1383
01:10:45,862 --> 01:10:48,022
<font color="yellow">Stay a little longer. I'm bored.</font>

1384
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:50,992
<font color="yellow">- I'll be back tomorrow.
- You're sure, right?</font>

1385
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:54,492
<font color="yellow">- Just stay in bed.
- All right.</font>

1386
01:10:54,662 --> 01:10:56,192
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

1387
01:11:12,162 --> 01:11:13,192
<font color="yellow">So Hee.</font>

1388
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:16,122
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

1389
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,148
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

1390
01:11:24,478 --> 01:11:25,718
<font color="yellow">You took longer than I thought.</font>

1391
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,548
<font color="yellow">Did you see her?</font>

1392
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:30,248
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1393
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:32,218
<font color="yellow">You're really something.</font>

1394
01:11:32,918 --> 01:11:34,198
<font color="yellow">How is So Hee? Is she all right?</font>

1395
01:11:35,348 --> 01:11:37,378
<font color="yellow">- Yes, she's fine.
- I'm glad to hear that.</font>

1396
01:11:39,718 --> 01:11:40,718
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

1397
01:11:43,218 --> 01:11:44,518
<font color="yellow">I told her how I feel about her.</font>

1398
01:11:44,978 --> 01:11:45,978
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1399
01:11:46,688 --> 01:11:47,688
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1400
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,033
<font color="yellow"><i>(NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW)</i></font>

1401
01:12:32,802 --> 01:12:34,732
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the child actor?</font>

1402
01:12:34,832 --> 01:12:37,462
<font color="yellow">My performance will make you admire me.</font>

1403
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:38,862
<font color="yellow">Hey, let go.</font>

1404
01:12:40,132 --> 01:12:42,531
<font color="yellow">- You said it was okay.
- I thought it was okay.</font>

1405
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,838
<font color="yellow">What's he doing? Is there something
I don't know on his schedule?</font>

1406
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:46,061
<font color="yellow">What is this every single time?</font>

1407
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,802
<font color="yellow">We have to lie and inconvenience people.</font>

1408
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:49,708
<font color="yellow">Is there something going on with
Mr. Cha Young Bin?</font>

1409
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:51,102
<font color="yellow">Is he seeing someone or what?</font>

1410
01:12:51,462 --> 01:12:52,502
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

1411
01:12:54,362 --> 01:12:56,401
<font color="yellow">All right, guys. Keep fighting.</font>

1412
01:12:56,402 --> 01:12:57,531
<font color="yellow">- Do it in the car.
- Hey!</font>

1413
01:12:57,532 --> 01:12:58,561
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- What?</font>

1414
01:12:58,562 --> 01:13:00,962
<font color="yellow">I'm so distressed because of a blockhead.</font>
