<font color="yellow">Oh, the stew!</font>

55
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:24,253
<font color="yellow">- Did you have fun at the party?
- It wasn't bad.</font>

56
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:27,229
<font color="yellow">Not bad? Why do you say it wasn't bad?</font>

57
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,116
<font color="yellow">Kids' birthday parties are all the same.</font>

58

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, you can eat
the tofu by yourself?</font>

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,133
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I'm running late.</font>

61
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,656
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo, should we go out and have fun?</font>

62
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,728
<font color="yellow">You don't want to go
to kindergarten, do you?</font>

63
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:48,020
<font color="yellow">- Dad, don't you have filming?
- Huh?</font>

64
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:51,712
<font color="yellow">- No, I don't.
- I have to go.</font>

65
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:55,586

Ye Na's partner today.</font>

67
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,307
<font color="yellow">Is your work not going well?</font>

68
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,749
<font color="yellow">Don't overwork yourself.</font>

69
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:28,096
<font color="yellow">You're dressing up today.</font>

70
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,574
<font color="yellow">Most of the advertisers will attend
the meeting today.</font>

71
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:33,478
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't look like I always do.</font>

72
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:42,600
<font color="yellow">You look like you have
too much makeup on.</font>

73
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,365
<font color="yellow">My makeup? This is how I usually do it.</font>

74
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,966
<font color="yellow">Do you have to go?
You're not the only one working there.</font>

75
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:57,415
<font color="yellow">Why do they have to drag out someone
with a family on the weekend?</font>

76
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:03,869
<font color="yellow">I planned this, so I have to take charge
and make it happen.</font>

77
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:07,074
<font color="yellow">It's the weekend. Whether we go
camping or to the zoo...</font>

78
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,812
<font color="yellow">We should get time to be with family.</font>

79
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,709
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to be dragged out
on a day like this?</font>

80
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,860
<font color="yellow">- It's only for today.
- What?</font>

81
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,173
<font color="yellow">I'll clean up here,
so please take Joon Soo.</font>

82
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:27,581
<font color="yellow"><i>Today... my wife is having an affair.</i></font>

83
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:32,593
<font color="yellow"><i>But I still don't know who the man is.</i></font>

84
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:34,672
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon.</font>

86
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:38,079
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

87
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:43,435
<font color="yellow">- You really have to go to this, right?
- What?</font>

88
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:46,843
<font color="yellow">I'm making coffee soon.</font>

89
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:50,053
<font color="yellow">Your favorite coffee. The one from Nepal.</font>

90
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,216
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go after you have coffee?</font>

91
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:56,160
<font color="yellow">We haven't talked much recently...</font>

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,951
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of time.</font>

93
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,896
<font color="yellow">Can't you take your time?</font>

94
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:04,139
<font color="yellow">I'd also like that, but I'm really late.</font>

95
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,355
<font color="yellow">I'll take the garbage.</font>

96
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:08,916
<font color="yellow">I can throw out the garbage...</font>

97
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,853
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

98
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,134
<font color="yellow">Soo Yeon...</font>

99
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,622
<font color="yellow"><i>I planned to barge into the hotel...</i></font>

100
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:24,759

102
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,255
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

103
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:48,579
<font color="yellow">Is some honey smeared here?
Why do you keep coming back?</font>

104
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,579
<font color="yellow">It's because--</font>

105
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,064
<font color="yellow">Just come and eat when it's time to eat!</font>

106
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,987
<font color="yellow">Just for an hour!
I'll be back after one hour.</font>

107
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,185
<font color="yellow">When will you grow up?
An hour, really?</font>

108
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,315
<font color="yellow">You only wrote three words,
"I would think" in one hour.</font>

109
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:16,870
<font color="yellow">I don't know what this is about</font>

110
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,425
<font color="yellow">but can you write everything
you want before you die?</font>

111
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,271
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat.</font>

112
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:26,264
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's wrong with this guy?</font>

113
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:30,649
<font color="yellow">His wife is going to meet
with another man.</font>

114
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,615
<font color="yellow">Do you like your dad or your mom?</font>

115
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,132
<font color="yellow">Dad...</font>

116
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:41,279
<font color="yellow">do you like grandpa or grandma?</font>

117
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:48,454
<font color="yellow">By any chance...
if Mom and Dad lived apart</font>

118
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:50,079
<font color="yellow">who would you live with?</font>

119
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,632
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to live together,
all three of us.</font>

120
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:59,725
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.
The three of us will live together...</font>

121
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:02,701
<font color="yellow">- Dad!
- Yes.</font>

122
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,057
<font color="yellow">- Cheer up.
- Huh?</font>

123
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:16,490
<font color="yellow">Aren't you too stressed out these days?</font>

124
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:19,899
<font color="yellow">Are you worried about me?</font>

125
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:23,677
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- What's this?</font>

126
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:26,788
<font color="yellow">I brought this to give to Ye Na,
but I'll give it to you.</font>

127
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:33,109
<font color="yellow">Really?
Are you sure you can give this to me?</font>

128
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:35,226
<font color="yellow">What about Ye Na then?</font>

129
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:37,345
<font color="yellow">I'll need to earn points
with something else.</font>

130
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:40,745
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

131
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,517
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thanks for this.</font>

132
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:47,470
<font color="yellow">When things get tough,
we should help each other.</font>

133
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,996
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm fine.</font>

134
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,216
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo.</font>

135
00:08:58,229 --> 00:08:59,692
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

136
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,806
<font color="yellow">I'll cheer up.</font>

137
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:08,097
<font color="yellow">I really can't stand this.</font>

138
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,349
<font color="yellow">Do they have to film on the weekend?</font>

139
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,735
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean. I was planning
to have lunch with my father-in-law.</font>

140
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,803
<font color="yellow">- But Hyun Woo begged me.
- You can't help it then.</font>

141
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:18,231
<font color="yellow">What about your lunch?</font>

142
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,660
<font color="yellow">Should I make you lunch
and bring it to you?</font>

143
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,136
<font color="yellow">No no... all of us will eat together
at a restaurant nearby.</font>

144
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,951
<font color="yellow">Then what about dinner?</font>

145
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:30,177
<font color="yellow">Of course I should eat dinner at home.
With you!</font>

146
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:34,195
<font color="yellow">- I'll have your favorite ready for you.
- Okay. I'll get going.</font>

147
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:39,469
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

148
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,182
<font color="yellow">Is it out? Let me see.</font>

149
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:53,153
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, you look so pretty
when you're working.</font>

150
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:55,345
<font color="yellow">I should take a picture of you.</font>

151
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,879
<font color="yellow">- Don't frown. Here I go, one, two--
- Attorney Choi.</font>

152
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,339
<font color="yellow">Then this way.
You look prettier this way.</font>

153
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:04,572
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing right now?
- Just smile.</font>

154
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:23,794
<font color="yellow">Honey, I'm sorry, but I'm really busy.
I didn't know you called.</font>

155
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:27,590
<font color="yellow"><i>- Did the recording start?</i>
- No, not yet, but we're about to start.</font>

156
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,503
<font color="yellow">Wow, everyone here is super busy.</font>

157
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:34,966
<font color="yellow">Do you want to say hello to everyone?
Here is Writer Kwon. Say hi.</font>

158
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:38,109
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, this is my wife.
Hello! Hello!</font>

159
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:41,235
<font color="yellow">That's Producer Ahn.
Producer Ahn, this is my wife!</font>

160
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:44,611
<font color="yellow">Look at everyone. This is no joke. Wow...</font>

161
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,812
<font color="yellow">Wow, everyone has a busy life.
It's really tough for me, too.</font>

162
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:51,826
<font color="yellow"><i>Shouldn't I bring you
something to drink at least?</i></font>

163
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:56,974
<font color="yellow">No! If you come here now,
you won't even be able to say hello.</font>

164
00:10:56,974 --> 00:11:00,754
<font color="yellow">Huh? Producer Ahn? Why, why, why?</font>

165
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:03,996
<font color="yellow">We're starting now?
Honey, it looks like I have to go now.</font>

166
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,438
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

167
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:08,272
<font color="yellow"><i>- Good luck!</i>
- Good luck! Okay.</font>

168
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,325
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon,
what time is the recording today?</font>

169
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:18,749
<font color="yellow">Two o'clock.</font>

170
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:21,957
<font color="yellow">Two o'clock? I have errands to run,
so I'll see you later.</font>

171
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,721
<font color="yellow">Wait. Aren't you coming with us?</font>

172
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,980
<font color="yellow">I'll be back in time, so don't worry.</font>

173
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,124
<font color="yellow">- You're coming now?
- Everyone's here early today.</font>

174
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,977
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Why are you here?</font>

175
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:33,788
<font color="yellow">He's filming today. Why are you here?</font>

176
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,660
<font color="yellow">Why? Is this a place I shouldn't come to?</font>

177
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,139
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but I have to get going.
See you later.</font>

178
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,427
<font color="yellow">I'm asking why you're here.</font>

179
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:47,681
<font color="yellow">Is everyone getting ready?</font>

180
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:49,308
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, really!</font>

181
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,413
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

182
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,860
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Why would you come here?</font>

183
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,120
<font color="yellow">Aren't Soo Yeon and Michael or some guy
meeting today?</font>

184
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,552
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

185
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,980
<font color="yellow">"Yeah"? Yeah?</font>

186
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:07,759
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? What about Soo Yeon?</font>

187
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,876
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good talk with Soo Yeon?
Is she not going to the hotel today?</font>

188
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,648
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

189
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:17,099
<font color="yellow">She left for work before I did.</font>

190
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:23,205
<font color="yellow">She forgot about yesterday.</font>

191
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:24,339
<font color="yellow">It was our wedding anniversary.</font>

192
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:28,826
<font color="yellow">She completely fell
for Michael or whoever.</font>

193
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:33,788
<font color="yellow">This leaves you with no choice.</font>

194
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:39,321
<font color="yellow">Barge into the hotel, beat him up,
pay for his injury, and end everything!</font>

195
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:42,455
<font color="yellow">Don't say it so easily just because
it's not your business, punk.</font>

196
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:45,541
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry about Joon Soo?</font>

197
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:49,644
<font color="yellow">I haven't made up my mind yet.</font>

198
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,413
<font color="yellow">You're right...</font>

199
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,923
<font color="yellow">But why did you come to work so relaxed?</font>

200
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:58,432
<font color="yellow">You're not in a situation
to behave this way.</font>

201
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:01,436
<font color="yellow">My wife's meeting is at three.</font>

202
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:06,121
<font color="yellow">I'd go crazy if I had to stay at home by
myself until then, so I came out.</font>

203
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,673
<font color="yellow"><i>[5 Hours until my wife's secret meeting]</i></font>

204
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,092
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

205
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,724
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me!
- My gosh.</font>

206
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,835
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Get away!</font>

207
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:09,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ah Ra. He's so handsome!</font>

208
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,182
<font color="yellow">Right, Yoon Ki's not there.</font>

209
00:14:14,182 --> 00:14:16,716
<font color="yellow"><i>There are a lot of other people.</i></font>

210
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,894
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

211
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,311
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

212
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,187
<font color="yellow">- Take this.
- Yes.</font>

213
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,604
<font color="yellow">Why, why, why? Is it a paper jam?</font>

214
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,010
<font color="yellow">It's not a paper jam,
so why does it say it is?</font>

215
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,610
<font color="yellow">I'll just use a different printer.</font>

216
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,369
<font color="yellow">No no. I can fix this quickly.</font>

217
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:08,153
<font color="yellow">Producer Do, I printed from a different
printer. You don't need to fix it.</font>

218
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:12,466
<font color="yellow">But I should still fix it.
We'll use it anyway.</font>

219
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:17,373
<font color="yellow">Why the heck would the printer break?
It's really annoying!</font>

220
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:18,951
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

221
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,563
<font color="yellow">Why is it not working?</font>

222
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:25,871
<font color="yellow">On top of everything, why the heck
is a printer not working?</font>

223
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,817
<font color="yellow">This printer is broken.</font>

224
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:31,160
<font color="yellow">This is a complete mess!</font>

225
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,067
<font color="yellow">We can't work like this!</font>

226
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,172
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you to fix it!
Why do you go on and on?</font>

227
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:41,610
<font color="yellow">We trusted you and bought this, so you
should show us how you're trustworthy!</font>

228
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,514
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me now?</font>

229
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:45,294
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

230
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:48,361
<font color="yellow">You quit your job
as a repair technician?</font>

231
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,696
<font color="yellow">What do you do now?</font>

232
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,673
<font color="yellow">You own a chicken restaurant?</font>

233
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,874
<font color="yellow">I see. "Five Minute Chicken"?</font>

234
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,658
<font color="yellow">Then I should order from you often.</font>

235
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:05,187
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm sorry.</font>

236
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,595
<font color="yellow">Hang up, hang up.</font>

237
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:10,649
<font color="yellow">Let's have a meeting.</font>

238
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,850
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's have a meeting.</font>

239
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,630
<font color="yellow">We should have a meeting.</font>

240
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,027
<font color="yellow">Our client today is in his 40's?</font>

241
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:24,679
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's 44 years old with a daughter.
He lives in Hangang Apartments.</font>

242
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,975
<font color="yellow">He seems pretty well-off.
His wife is 40 years old, a homemaker.</font>

243
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:32,663
<font color="yellow">This is a pilot, so we should pick a few
more cases for the regular filming.</font>

244
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:34,178
<font color="yellow">Yes, we should.</font>

245
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:35,664
<font color="yellow">- Ji Hoon, data.
- Yes.</font>

246
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:40,504
<font color="yellow">- You should give me a summary of this.
- Look at the first page for now.</font>

247
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:42,600
<font color="yellow">This is the hottest item these days.</font>

248
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,697
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, I like
that you always work hard.</font>

249
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:49,926
<font color="yellow">I guess things like this
happen a lot these days.</font>

250
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,899
<font color="yellow">It's really interesting.
There are also a lot of comments.</font>

251
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,601
<font color="yellow">I know about this one, too. It's also up
on an online community I know.</font>

252
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:58,629
<font color="yellow">A lot of people shared it,
so it's up everywhere.</font>

253
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:01,509
<font color="yellow">"My wife is having an affair this week"?</font>

254
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,496
<font color="yellow">Wow, the title is catchy. We should pick
this one based on impact alone.</font>

255
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:07,220
<font color="yellow">What impact?</font>

256
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,862
<font color="yellow">Isn't it Saturday today? Awesome,
he must be heading there today.</font>

257
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:14,078
<font color="yellow">Producer Ahn, what would you do
if you caught them in the act?</font>

258
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,520
<font color="yellow">Me? Why would you ask what I'd do?</font>

259
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,309
<font color="yellow">As soon as I saw him,
I'd punch him in the face!</font>

260
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,314
<font color="yellow">But what if the man was Kang Ho Dong?</font>

261
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:25,732
<font color="yellow">What a scare!</font>

262
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,636
<font color="yellow">What the heck? You want to fight?</font>

263
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,505
<font color="yellow">- You want to fight?
- Please spare me.</font>

264
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,890
<font color="yellow">What the heck?</font>

265
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,203
<font color="yellow">You'd deserve it.</font>

266
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,686
<font color="yellow">Why would she cheat on someone like me,
with someone like Kang Ho Dong?</font>

267
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:42,028
<font color="yellow">Women these days don't like bulky men.</font>

268
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,675
<font color="yellow">They like men like me, with fine muscles.</font>

269
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:47,359
<font color="yellow">You're pretty funny these days.</font>

270
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,096
<font color="yellow">You'd get sued if you use violence.</font>

271
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:55,124
<font color="yellow">If it was me, I'd tell him that I'm
her husband in a calm manner.</font>

272
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,276
<font color="yellow"><i>I'd tell him that I know everything
about what's going on between the two.</i></font>

273
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,501
<font color="yellow"><i>Then I'd make him tell me about
his identity, his work and his family.</i></font>

274
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,298
<font color="yellow"><i>Then I'd call everyone who knows him.</i></font>

275
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,281
<font color="yellow">Hello, is this Han Soo's father-in-law?</font>

276
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:09,686
<font color="yellow">Is this his sister-in-law? I see you're
his teacher in high school. Correct?</font>

277
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:12,768
<font color="yellow"><i>I'd expose his affair and
destroy his status and his life.</i></font>

278
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:14,974
<font color="yellow">I knew it, Producer Lee!</font>

279
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:19,510
<font color="yellow">My ideal type is someone who is calm
and acts based on data--</font>

280

- Al...</font>

281
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,862
<font color="yellow">Aren't you talking too hastily just
because it's someone else's business?</font>

282
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:26,896
<font color="yellow">How can men
forgive themselves for cheating</font>

283
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:29,931
<font color="yellow">but not forgive women for the same?</font>

284
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:32,740
<font color="yellow">- If you ask why--
- In the end...</font>

285
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,505
<font color="yellow">isn't it about what kind of ending
the writer wants?</font>

286
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:39,723
<font color="yellow">Whether he wants to break them up
and go back to before</font>

287
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:42,174
<font color="yellow">or he wants to take revenge
with a divorce in mind.</font>

288
00:18:42,174 --> 00:18:46,502
<font color="yellow">If he follows his emotions, he'll miss
his target and find himself a fool.</font>

289
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,404
<font color="yellow">- Ji Hoon.
- Yes.</font>

290
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:50,384
<font color="yellow">- Have you tried to contact him?
- What?</font>

291
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:53,767
<font color="yellow">I'll try to contact him. Or I can google
him and look up his phone number.</font>

292
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,231
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

293
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,532
<font color="yellow">Now! "My wife is having an affair this
week. What should I do?"</font>

294
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:04,520
<font color="yellow">After reading the first line,
his loser vibe is wrapping up my body.</font>

295
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,247
<font color="yellow">"The man who said
he'd wait for my wife--"</font>

296
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,237
<font color="yellow">I've heard this story before.</font>

297
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,259
<font color="yellow"><i>[Hyun Woo]</i></font>

298
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,163
<font color="yellow"><i>It's me, so shut up.</i></font>

299
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:25,055
<font color="yellow">I sent him a text. If I don't get
an answer today, I'll look up his ID.</font>

300
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,636
<font color="yellow">Don't do it, punk!</font>

301
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:30,348
<font color="yellow">Hey, someone may be
considering a divorce!</font>

302
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,115
<font color="yellow">Are you having fun right now?</font>

303
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,467
<font color="yellow">You guys are sociopaths!
Throw them all out!</font>

304
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,508
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?
Why would you post it there?</font>

305
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:42,008
<font color="yellow">You have me and Yoon Ki.</font>

306
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:45,894
<font color="yellow">What kind of good things would you hear
from strangers by posting it there?</font>

307
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,208
<font color="yellow">Everyone's excited to have
bait to bite off.</font>

308
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,933
<font color="yellow">I wanted to think rationally.</font>

309
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:54,045
<font color="yellow">I'm not in my right mind these days.</font>

310
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:57,088
<font color="yellow">I understand,
but it's such an important issue--</font>

311
00:19:57,088 --> 00:20:00,046
<font color="yellow">Because it's an important issue,
I wanted to ask them!</font>

312
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,167
<font color="yellow">At first, I posted it on a whim
after I had a drink.</font>

313
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:13,856
<font color="yellow">I wasn't expecting much.</font>

314
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:17,752
<font color="yellow">But there were actually
quite a few people</font>

315
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,013
<font color="yellow">who worried about me
as if it was their own issue.</font>

316
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,462
<font color="yellow">Do you believe that?</font>

317
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:24,564
<font color="yellow">They're not your family.
Why would they worry</font>

318
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:26,664
<font color="yellow">about a stranger in such
a harsh time like this?</font>

319
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:28,959
<font color="yellow">Who would understand what's on my mind?</font>

320
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:32,480
<font color="yellow">It goes up and down
a few hundred times a day.</font>

321
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,163
<font color="yellow">I want to destroy everything
and end it...</font>

322
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,997
<font color="yellow">but then I think that's not the answer.
You don't understand, punk.</font>

323
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:41,117
<font color="yellow">Why would I not understand?</font>

324
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:43,769
<font color="yellow">Producer Do, you have a visitor.</font>

325
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:46,887
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, long time no see.</font>

326
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:51,266
<font color="yellow">Choi Yoon Ki's...</font>

327
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:54,128
<font color="yellow"><i>- When I look at my wife, I feel cold.</i>
- What are you doing?</font>

328
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:58,423
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, yes.</font>

329
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,887
<font color="yellow">It's been such a long time,
I didn't recognize you.</font>

330
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:06,989
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

331
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:09,973
<font color="yellow">By the way, what brings you here?</font>

332
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:13,630
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see my husband on camera...</font>

333
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,093
<font color="yellow">and you're working hard,
so I brought some beverages and snacks.</font>

334
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:20,404
<font color="yellow">You could've just come.
You didn't have to bring these.</font>

335
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:24,656
<font color="yellow">What about my husband?
He said he'd be filming today.</font>

336
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:27,334
<font color="yellow">Yoon Ki went out to eat.</font>

337
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:30,413
<font color="yellow">- He said that he'd eat with the staff.
- Yes, that's right.</font>

338
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:33,321
<font color="yellow">He went to eat with the staff, yes...</font>

339
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:39,608
<font color="yellow">But Yoon Ki must be nervous
ahead of his first filming.</font>

340
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:41,426
<font color="yellow">He's experiencing indigestion.</font>

341
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:47,068
<font color="yellow">So he wanted to get medicine,
and he went outside.</font>

342
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:52,396
<font color="yellow">We're busy preparing for the shoot.</font>

343
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,472
<font color="yellow">What are you guys doing?
Aren't you getting ready?</font>

344
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:58,534
<font color="yellow">They're too busy getting ready
for the shoot. Please come this way.</font>

345
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,348
<font color="yellow">- Like this.
- Like this.</font>

346
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:04,400
<font color="yellow">- Straighten your arm.
- I can do it!</font>

347
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,960
<font color="yellow">Like this.
This is how you're going to swing.</font>

348
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,936
<font color="yellow">- Nice!
- Wait, try one more swing.</font>

349
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,759
<font color="yellow">This line has to come alive.</font>

350
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,900
<font color="yellow">Pick it up, man. Pick it up! Seriously...</font>

351
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,509
<font color="yellow">Pick it up.</font>

352
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:22,950
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

353
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,791
<font color="yellow">It's not two o'clock yet.</font>

354
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,760
<font color="yellow">Come right back.
Your wife is in the office now.</font>

355
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,204
<font color="yellow">I'm going to hit it now.</font>

356
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:32,271
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

357
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:36,030
<font color="yellow">- Have this.
- Thank you.</font>

358
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:43,326
<font color="yellow">- He must've gone far.
- What?</font>

359
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:47,414
<font color="yellow">- There is no pharmacy around here.
- I see.</font>

360
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:54,583
<font color="yellow">Are you going through
a tough time these days?</font>

361
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,583
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

362
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,259
<font color="yellow">You ask him to come out
a lot these days.</font>

363
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,705
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

364
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:04,355
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, yes. Yes, I do.</font>

365
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:05,847
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

366
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:09,986
<font color="yellow">At first, I wondered
why he was getting so many messages.</font>

367
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:12,369
<font color="yellow">I thought he was having an affair.</font>

368
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,630
<font color="yellow">I see. I'm sorry.</font>

369
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,366
<font color="yellow">For a woman...
she thinks about things like that</font>

370
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:23,103
<font color="yellow">if her husband looks at the phone
more than usual.</font>

371
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:24,688
<font color="yellow">It's possible, of course.</font>

372
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:33,987
<font color="yellow">Ah Ra, let's say...</font>

373
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:41,000
<font color="yellow">Yoon Ki is really having an affair.
What would you do?</font>

374
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,727
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying that he's
actually having an affair.</font>

375
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,016
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious.</font>

376
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:51,315
<font color="yellow">- I'm planning a program about affairs--
- It's okay.</font>

377
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:53,020
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

378
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,094
<font color="yellow"><i>As long as he doesn't get caught,
I think it's okay.</i></font>

379
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:02,190
<font color="yellow"><i>Making an effort not to get caught means</i></font>

380
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,628
<font color="yellow"><i>that there is still
a possibility it's love.</i></font>

381
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:07,978
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to believe.</font>

382
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:10,832
<font color="yellow">What if he gets caught?</font>

383
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,368
<font color="yellow">I'd have to kill him.</font>

384
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,470
<font color="yellow">You're back!</font>

385
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:27,030
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

386
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,227
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

387
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:33,919
<font color="yellow">I brought some snacks.
How are you feeling?</font>

388
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,616
<font color="yellow">Me? Well...</font>

389
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:41,648
<font color="yellow">- In...
- Is your indigestion better now?</font>

390
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,607
<font color="yellow">Indigest... that's right.</font>

391
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,657
<font color="yellow">Yes, I have indigestion.</font>

392
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,355
<font color="yellow">I feel stuffed up.</font>

393
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,347
<font color="yellow">Honey, why are you sweating so much?</font>

394
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:57,138
<font color="yellow">It happened so quickly,
I'm having cold sweats.</font>

395
00:24:57,138 --> 00:25:00,269
<font color="yellow">- Shouldn't you go to a doctor?
- No no no.</font>

396
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:06,508
<font color="yellow">I took the medicine.
I feel like I'm much better now.</font>

397
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,257
<font color="yellow">- It's much better.
- Really?</font>

398
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:14,969
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.</font>

399
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:17,010
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get going.</font>

400
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,243
<font color="yellow">- You're leaving?
- You're leaving?</font>

401
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:21,048
<font color="yellow">I'll be a nuisance at work.</font>

402
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:23,381
<font color="yellow">I'm happy that I got to see you.</font>

403
00:25:24,996 --> 00:25:28,233
<font color="yellow">When you have time,
come visit us with your family.</font>

404
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:29,882
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

405
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:33,784
<font color="yellow">- See you at home.
- Okay. Be careful getting home.</font>

406
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:34,942
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

407
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,785
<font color="yellow">Awesome! Awesome!</font>

408
00:25:56,785 --> 00:26:00,664
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it awesome? We even had a face
chat about my shoot earlier.</font>

409
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:02,386
<font color="yellow">But see how she followed me
all the way here?</font>

410
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:04,380
<font color="yellow">I don't know what she's
detecting these days</font>

411
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,374
<font color="yellow">she has antennas up in all directions.</font>

412
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:10,315
<font color="yellow">I got totally scared.</font>

413
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,914
<font color="yellow">When did she come?</font>

414
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:17,113
<font color="yellow">- Is it funny to you?
- What?</font>

415
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:20,972
<font color="yellow">Is it funny that she's nervous
and worried about you having an affair?</font>

416
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:22,619
<font color="yellow">Is it not funny?</font>

417
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:27,411
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what you're doing?</font>

418
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,848
<font color="yellow">How can you laugh
while you're betraying your wife?</font>

419
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:34,480
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel guilty?</font>

420
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,054
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

421
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:40,811
<font color="yellow">She's trying so hard because
she loves you. Because she loves you.</font>

422
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,489
<font color="yellow">You should get caught for real
and get punished.</font>

423
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:48,201
<font color="yellow">You should be beaten to death.</font>

424
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:52,732
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're cheating too!
Why are you blaming me?</font>

425
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:56,160
<font color="yellow">You're doing the same,
so why do you kick up my dirt?</font>

426
00:26:57,913 --> 00:27:00,320
<font color="yellow">I don't do things like having affairs.</font>

427
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,718
<font color="yellow">You're joking.</font>

428
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:04,579
<font color="yellow">My wife's having an affair.</font>

429
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:11,846
<font color="yellow">It's not me.
My wife is having an affair, you punk.</font>

430
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,382
<font color="yellow">You'll have to pay a fine if you litter.</font>

431
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:34,445
<font color="yellow">What the heck. Give me.</font>

432
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:37,031
<font color="yellow">There's also a fine
for smoking in the park.</font>

433
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:43,875
<font color="yellow">Did Attorney Choi's wife leave?</font>

434
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,740

- Yes, sir.</font>

577
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:27,097
<font color="yellow">I'd like to check if someone
has already checked in.</font>

578
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,097
<font color="yellow">Yes, sure.</font>

579
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:30,858
<font color="yellow">It's for three o'clock. For Michael.</font>

580
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:34,626
<font color="yellow">- Is it for yourself?
- Yes.</font>

581
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:38,885
<font color="yellow">Michael... Jordan?</font>

582
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,913
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I can't check it for you
unless it's for yourself.</font>

583
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,382
<font color="yellow">- I see.
- Yes.</font>

584
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,724
<font color="yellow">- By any chance, the room number--
- I'm sorry, sir.</font>

585
00:38:52,735 --> 00:38:54,581
<font color="yellow"><i>Idiot!</i></font>

586
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,418
<font color="yellow"><i>Hyun Woo, how did it go?</i></font>

587
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:05,606
<font color="yellow">This is Writer Kwon Bo Young.
Hello, how are you doing?</font>

588
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:08,474
<font color="yellow">I understand
that it's a difficult decision.</font>

589
00:39:08,474 --> 00:39:12,411
<font color="yellow">Of course! We'll make sure
it won't be harmful to you in any way.</font>

590
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,161
<font color="yellow">Of course, yes.</font>

591
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:19,684
<font color="yellow">Then why don't we come to you
and explain it in more detail?</font>

592
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:24,096
<font color="yellow">Thank you! Thank you!</font>

593
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:26,625
<font color="yellow">Yes, we'll see you in a bit.
Thank you!</font>

594
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,322
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything to drink?</font>

595
00:39:32,132 --> 00:39:35,262
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't change his mind
when he comes out, would he?</font>

596
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:38,094
<font color="yellow">Isn't it all for nothing?</font>

597
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:43,331
<font color="yellow">What? I'm just worried.
I'm just getting myself ready.</font>

598
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,806
<font color="yellow">I'll try to convince him.</font>

599
00:39:45,806 --> 00:39:48,336
<font color="yellow">It's nothing to brag about,
so it's understandable that he's afraid.</font>

600
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:51,425
<font color="yellow">He said he'd come, so he does have
thoughts of going through with it.</font>

601
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:53,309
<font color="yellow">Let's try to convince him to decide.</font>

602
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:59,561
<font color="yellow">And if it doesn't work out,
we'll have to find another solution.</font>

603
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:01,503
<font color="yellow">I got it. Why are you annoyed with me?</font>

604
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:03,949
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, what about Toycrane?</font>

605
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:07,282
<font color="yellow">He posted just now, and he's at the hotel
trying to catch his wife and the man.</font>

606
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,784
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- What's Toycrane? Where can I find it?</font>

607
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,126
<font color="yellow">Wow, awesome!</font>

608
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:15,181
<font color="yellow">The post is shared in my community.</font>

609
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,420
<font color="yellow">Toycrane uploaded a new post.</font>

610
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,614
<font color="yellow">He already got beat up by the man
and went to the hospital.</font>

611
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:23,766
<font color="yellow">What the. That's nonsense!</font>

612
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:27,003
<font color="yellow">No, that's not right. Here, it says that
he's beating up his wife.</font>

613
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:29,291
<font color="yellow">Someone posted that some guy
is beating his wife at a hotel</font>

614
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,577
<font color="yellow">so he's going to post a video
to prove it.</font>

615
00:40:31,577 --> 00:40:33,989
<font color="yellow">Crazy... That's absolutely not true!</font>

616
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:36,914
<font color="yellow">Toycrane... Claw crane?</font>

617
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:39,349
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell right away?
It's a made-up story!</font>

618
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,500
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many
scammers these days?</font>

619
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,630
<font color="yellow">It means it's really hot. That's why
people are gathering on their own.</font>

620
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,157
<font color="yellow">He can't be in his right mind right now</font>

621
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,684
<font color="yellow">so how will you convince him
for the show?</font>

622
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:49,831
<font color="yellow">And it's too late.</font>

623
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,382
<font color="yellow">Send our client a text
to see if he's there.</font>

624
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:55,894
<font color="yellow">Yes, Writer Kwon.</font>

625
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:57,755
<font color="yellow">Wife's affair...</font>

626
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,657
<font color="yellow">At a hotel today.</font>

627
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,454
<font color="yellow">Toycrane...</font>

628
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:03,000
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

629
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:05,550
<font color="yellow">You should wear this.</font>

630
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:14,478
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, you can convince the client
even if he keeps saying no, right?</font>

631
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:18,373
<font color="yellow">It's your specialty. If you can
convince him, you don't need me.</font>

632
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:21,271
<font color="yellow">- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.</font>

633
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:24,012
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine.</font>

634
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:26,764
<font color="yellow">Yoon Ki,
you should listen to Writer Kwon.</font>

635
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:29,001
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, by any chance--</font>

636
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:30,505
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

637
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:32,362
<font color="yellow">- Come quickly.
- Good luck!</font>

638
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:34,226
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

639
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,856
<font color="yellow">I'm going crazy here. This is too much!</font>

640
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:43,021
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! What do I do?</font>

641
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:44,826
<font color="yellow">Please! Be quiet!</font>

642
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:46,625
<font color="yellow"><i>[I'm at the hotel. To be honest,
I hope my wife doesn't show up.]</i></font>

643
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,572
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm Toycrane's friend.</i></font>

644
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,536
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm on my way to the hotel.</i></font>

645
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:54,181
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll check on the situation,
so don't believe other madeup stories.</i></font>

646
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:58,376
<font color="yellow">Lord Ahn?
He's also saying that he's a friend?</font>

647
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:00,438
<font color="yellow">Who's real?</font>

648
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,652
<font color="yellow"><i>Who is real?</i></font>

649
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:18,574
<font color="yellow">- Why did you come here?
- Because I was worried about you!</font>

650
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:20,675
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I'd
be able to work anyway.</font>

651
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:27,239
<font color="yellow">- Did Soo Yeon come?
- She hasn't come yet.</font>

652
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:32,490
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Woo.
- What?</font>

653
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,764
<font color="yellow">You're completely pale.
Are you all right?</font>

654
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:38,380
<font color="yellow">Breathe deep. You should breathe.</font>

655
00:42:43,012 --> 00:42:44,588
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

656
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,380
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm a little better.</font>

657
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,735
<font color="yellow">Do you even know the room number?
You have to know that to barge in.</font>

658
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:56,000
<font color="yellow">I asked at the front desk, but he
wouldn't tell me unless I'm that person.</font>

659
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,628
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be so strict?</font>

660
00:42:59,628 --> 00:43:01,782
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait.</font>

661
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:05,376
<font color="yellow"><i>Anyone know how to find a room number</i></font>

662
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:07,773
<font color="yellow"><i>even if you didn't book the room?
It's urgent!</i></font>

663
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:10,003
<font color="yellow"><i>Wow, is this it? Toycrane? For real?</i></font>

664
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:12,784
<font color="yellow"><i>It's him! He went to the hotel
but doesn't know the room number.</i></font>

665
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:16,478
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not him. I'm his friend.</i></font>

666
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:17,760
<font color="yellow"><i>It's for real! The real ones showed up!</i></font>

667
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,923
<font color="yellow"><i>If someone should find two men
in a hotel, let us know.</i></font>

668
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:21,775
<font color="yellow"><i>- Who do you think is real? No.1?
- No. 2 is real.</i></font>

669
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:24,293
<font color="yellow"><i>Lord Ahn? Look at his nickname. I can
feel the energy of seeking attention.</i></font>

670
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:34,882
<font color="yellow">It looks like you need a room key
to get on the elevator here.</font>

671
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:37,126
<font color="yellow">Really? What should I do?</font>

672
00:43:37,126 --> 00:43:38,873
<font color="yellow">I'm losing my mind!</font>

673
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:41,284
<font color="yellow">How can you not know?
What would you have done without me?</font>

674
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:43,626
<font color="yellow">You'd have just watched them
take the elevator up.</font>

675
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:45,394
<font color="yellow">Hold on, hold on.</font>

676
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:48,306
<font color="yellow"><i>We don't have a room key,
so we may not even get on the elevator.</i></font>

677
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:51,394
<font color="yellow"><i>At this rate, we can't follow his wife
even if she shows up. Please help!</i></font>

678
00:43:53,182 --> 00:43:54,905
<font color="yellow"><i>It looks like he's really
Toycrane's friend.</i></font>

679
00:43:54,905 --> 00:43:56,875
<font color="yellow">There aren't many hotels where you can't
get on the elevator without a room key.</font>

680
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,195
<font color="yellow"><i>Tell me the hotel. I'll solve it for you.</i></font>

681
00:43:58,195 --> 00:44:00,333
<font color="yellow"><i>I looked it up, and there are four hotels
in Seoul you need a room key to get in.</i></font>

682
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,536
<font color="yellow"><i>Is it Hills Hotel, by any chance?</i></font>

683
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:02,929
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you taken away if you get in
without a card?</i></font>

684
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:04,800
<font color="yellow"><i>You won't be able to push any button
if you don't have a key card.</i></font>

685
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,875
<font color="yellow"><i>Since when were there so many idiots
in this country?</i></font>

686
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,559
<font color="yellow"><i>I've never been.
Is that what happens in hotels now?</i></font>

687
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,815
<font color="yellow"><i>Book a room and
get a new key card. Okay?</i></font>

688
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,876
<font color="yellow">Let's just get a room.
Then they'll give us a key card.</font>

689
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:17,902
<font color="yellow">Then we can get on
the elevator with that.</font>

690
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:22,039
<font color="yellow">I have to go that far?
It must be expensive on weekends.</font>

691
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,900
<font color="yellow">That's not an issue right now!</font>

692
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:28,864
<font color="yellow">I'd like a room please.</font>

693
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:32,407
<font color="yellow">- Do you mean, one of the guest rooms?
- Yes, just give me one, whatever it is.</font>

694
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:34,067
<font color="yellow">Please wait.</font>

695
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,019
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, sir. We're full right now,
so nothing is available.</font>

696
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:42,369
<font color="yellow">- You don't have any room?
- No. I'm sorry.</font>

697
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:45,172
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense! You're lying!
You really don't have any room?</font>

698
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:47,255
<font color="yellow">We have availability tomorrow.
May I help you with that?</font>

699
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:50,235
<font color="yellow">No, I have to have one today.
We need one today!</font>

700
00:44:50,235 --> 00:44:53,507
<font color="yellow">- We're in a hurry!
- There is nothing. Let's just go.</font>

701
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:56,773
<font color="yellow">What do we do then? What do we do?
You really don't have one?</font>

702
00:44:56,773 --> 00:44:58,119
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

703
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,614
<font color="yellow">- Let's just go.
- What do we do?</font>

704
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,733
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

705
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:05,434
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

706
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:07,768
<font color="yellow">You should feel comfortable.</font>

707
00:45:07,768 --> 00:45:12,769
<font color="yellow">He's a lawyer, so feel free to ask him
any questions or ask for help anytime.</font>

708
00:45:14,365 --> 00:45:16,891
<font color="yellow">I said I'd do it on a whim...</font>

709
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:20,063
<font color="yellow">but I feel embarrassed now it's going
to be broadcasted.</font>

710
00:45:20,063 --> 00:45:22,963
<font color="yellow">We'll blur out the screen
so that your face won't show.</font>

711
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:25,764
<font color="yellow">We can change the sound
of your voice if you'd like.</font>

712
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,626
<font color="yellow">Still, people in the know would know.</font>

713
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:32,460
<font color="yellow">We don't air it without your permission.</font>

714
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,570
<font color="yellow">You can relax and think of it as
you're talking to us.</font>

715
00:45:39,813 --> 00:45:44,175
<font color="yellow">To be honest,
I think my wife is having an affair.</font>

716
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:47,003
<font color="yellow">But she's not someone
who would ever do that.</font>

717
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,867
<font color="yellow">Then why do you think
she's having an affair?</font>

718
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:53,641
<font color="yellow">You find that your wife
is a bit weird, right?</font>

719
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:57,181
<font color="yellow">She goes out a lot,
or checks her cellphone a lot.</font>

720
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:00,114
<font color="yellow">No, she's home pretty much all the time.</font>

721
00:46:00,114 --> 00:46:02,141
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even see
her friends too often.</font>

722
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:05,306
<font color="yellow">Our child is in middle school,
so she's busy taking care of her.</font>

723
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:09,804
<font color="yellow">What about during the day
after you go to work?</font>

724
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:11,139
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

725
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:14,599
<font color="yellow">Women usually have affairs
during the daytime.</font>

726
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,606
<font color="yellow">I don't think that's it either.</font>

727
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:20,673
<font color="yellow">Our child is a good student, and
my wife is very dilligent.</font>

728
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:25,186
<font color="yellow">She goes to seminars about college
exams, meets with the teachers...</font>

729
00:46:25,186 --> 00:46:28,250
<font color="yellow">and she's busy picking her up after
school for additional lessons.</font>

730
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,822
<font color="yellow">Wow, your wife works very hard.</font>

731
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:33,304
<font color="yellow">Then why are you suspicious of her?</font>

732
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:34,931
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

733
00:46:34,931 --> 00:46:37,329
<font color="yellow">It's strange...</font>

734
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:40,250
<font color="yellow">but I feel like something changed
in a strange way.</font>

735
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,231
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I feel that way.</font>

736
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,835
<font color="yellow">- I'll go pick it up.
- Thank you.</font>

737
00:46:51,784 --> 00:46:53,914
<font color="yellow">She's cheating, 100 percent.</font>

738
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:56,255
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

739
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,496
<font color="yellow">You saw the climbing wear
underneath his jacket, right?</font>

740
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:02,764
<font color="yellow">- It's safe.
- What about it?</font>

741
00:47:02,764 --> 00:47:06,922
<font color="yellow">Those who wear the climbing wear
because they enjoy climbing</font>

742
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:09,822
<font color="yellow">don't wear a dress jacket over it.
They wear a climbing jacket.</font>

743
00:47:09,822 --> 00:47:13,764
<font color="yellow">Also, climbing enthusiasts
buy flashy color clothes.</font>

744
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:18,628
<font color="yellow">So he didn't get it for himself.
His wife bought it for him.</font>

745
00:47:19,652 --> 00:47:21,670
<font color="yellow">But how is that proof of cheating?</font>

746
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,909
<font color="yellow">His wife felt bad for him,
so she bought his clothes</font>

747
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:28,148
<font color="yellow">as she was buying one for herself.</font>

748
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:34,271
<font color="yellow">And his wife is having an affair
with the excuse of going climbing.</font>

749
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:38,025
<font color="yellow">They'd go hiking
to the mountain together.</font>

750
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:41,152
<font color="yellow">They'd meet up with their partners
and separate.</font>

751
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:46,150
<font color="yellow">Then they'd meet up again
to head home together.</font>

752
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,195
<font color="yellow">It's obvious.</font>

753
00:47:49,552 --> 00:47:51,945
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

754
00:47:53,764 --> 00:47:56,864
<font color="yellow">Your wife likes to go climbing with her
friend in the neighborhood, right?</font>

755
00:47:58,193 --> 00:48:01,070
<font color="yellow">How did you know? Every weekend...</font>

756
00:48:04,313 --> 00:48:08,141
<font color="yellow">What if it's real? What should I do?</font>

757
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:11,141
<font color="yellow">I encouraged you to beat him up,
but I don't think you should.</font>

758
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:13,757
<font color="yellow">Let's be calm about this here.</font>

759
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,858
<font color="yellow">If you beat him up
and don't get to ask questions</font>

760
00:48:15,858 --> 00:48:17,958
<font color="yellow">it'll just become a big mess.</font>

761
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:20,958
<font color="yellow">I don't think you should show that side
to Soo Yeon.</font>

762
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:28,081
<font color="yellow">- That's what "Tuna Mayo" said, too.
- "Tuna Mayo"?</font>

763
00:48:28,081 --> 00:48:32,898
<font color="yellow">Yes. "Tuna Mayo" has the most rational
comments on my post.</font>

764
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:37,583
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo! You trust just about anyone,
that's why it's not working out for you!</font>

765
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,773
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't have anyone to tell.</i></font>

766
00:48:39,773 --> 00:48:44,076
<font color="yellow">Unlike women, men are too embarrassed
to tell anyone.</font>

767
00:48:44,076 --> 00:48:47,757
<font color="yellow">I felt like I'd die,
holding everything in by myself.</font>

768
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:49,971
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is embarrassing.</font>

769
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:53,643
<font color="yellow">When the husband has an affair,
the wife gets consoled by others.</font>

770
00:48:53,643 --> 00:48:56,123
<font color="yellow">But when the wife has an affair</font>

771
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:58,603
<font color="yellow">the husband gets blamed
for not doing his job.</font>

772
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,378
<font color="yellow">It's really...</font>

773
00:49:00,378 --> 00:49:04,099
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you opened up to your wife
and talked to her?</font>

774
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:08,050
<font color="yellow">I don't know where or how to start.</font>

775
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:12,021
<font color="yellow">Think carefully. Don't be awkward and
start stuttering and embarrass yourself.</font>

776
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,351
<font color="yellow">- Has it lasted a while?
- Right.</font>

777
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:20,427
<font color="yellow">- Since when did they go out?
- Right, right.</font>

778
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:24,275
<font color="yellow">Why did he do it?
What does he plan to do now?</font>

779
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:26,844
<font color="yellow">- And I need his apology.
- Good job, good job.</font>

780
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:32,663
<font color="yellow">By the way,
you really don't know who he is?</font>

781
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:35,079
<font color="yellow">Michael? How would I know?</font>

782
00:49:37,197 --> 00:49:40,748
<font color="yellow">Where did she meet him?</font>

783
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:43,804
<font color="yellow"><i>Chatting on the internet, maybe?</i></font>

784
00:49:43,804 --> 00:49:45,809
<font color="yellow">I heard that's how a lot of people meet.</font>

785
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:48,969
<font color="yellow">That's right. A lot of people meet
through social media.</font>

786
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:54,434
<font color="yellow">And there are apps that find people
within a certain distance.</font>

787
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:57,331
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think about it,
I can't figure it out.</font>

788
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:58,925
<font color="yellow">She stays at home all the time.</font>

789
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:01,601
<font color="yellow">What about a private detective?
Did you not ask?</font>

790
00:50:05,028 --> 00:50:08,693
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't seen the text message,
you'd have been screwed.</font>

791
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:14,335
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's good or bad
that I saw the text message.</font>

792
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:16,996
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought it was a relief.</i></font>

793
00:50:16,996 --> 00:50:19,858
<font color="yellow">- You mean, that she locked the phone?
- Yes.</font>

794
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:24,858
<font color="yellow">I couldn't see any text messages,
so I felt relieved at the moment.</font>

795
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,291
<font color="yellow">Then let's suppose that
your wife really cheated on you.</font>

796
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:31,876
<font color="yellow">Would you consider getting a divorce?</font>

797
00:50:31,876 --> 00:50:34,603
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I'm worried about Joon Soo.</font>

798
00:50:34,603 --> 00:50:39,567
<font color="yellow">Joon Soo is one issue, but divorce is
not easy for many reasons.</font>

799
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:40,992
<font color="yellow">Rather than getting a divorce</font>

800
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:42,465
<font color="yellow">you'd like to resolve it
through conversation, right?</font>

801
00:50:42,465 --> 00:50:44,440
<font color="yellow">Or you'd let it slide.</font>

802
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,847
<font color="yellow">If you just trust her,
at least you feel better.</font>

803
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:49,929
<font color="yellow">Is it possible?
Can you do that if it happened to you?</font>

804
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:51,333
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't do that!</i></font>

805
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,646
<font color="yellow">I tell myself to trust my wife...</font>

806
00:50:53,646 --> 00:50:56,420
<font color="yellow">but it dawns on me as I walk, as I eat...</font>

807
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,875
<font color="yellow">I'd live the rest of my life
doubting her.</font>

808
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,804
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

809
00:51:05,036 --> 00:51:07,574
<font color="yellow">Isn't it past the time?</font>

810
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:14,800
<font color="yellow">What do I do? If I miss her,
she might really cheat on me.</font>

811
00:51:16,918 --> 00:51:20,967
<font color="yellow">No.
It's possible she didn't come at all.</font>

812
00:51:20,967 --> 00:51:23,228
<font color="yellow">Hey, maybe she said no to him?</font>

813
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,182
<font color="yellow">Calm down, calm down.</font>

814
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:31,161
<font color="yellow">Call her.
Call her and ask her where she is.</font>

815
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:32,521
<font color="yellow">- Right, call her.
- Call her.</font>

816
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:33,989
<font color="yellow">The phone, right.</font>

817
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,998
<font color="yellow"><i>[My wife]</i></font>

818
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,487
<font color="yellow">Hello? Yes, this is he.</font>

819
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:56,947
<font color="yellow">What? Where did you say?</font>

820
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,614
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll be right there.
Could you wait?</font>

821
00:52:00,614 --> 00:52:01,963
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

822
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:04,143
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

823
00:52:05,273 --> 00:52:07,998
<font color="yellow">My wife went climbing again today.</font>

824
00:52:07,998 --> 00:52:10,552
<font color="yellow">She took the car to go
to Gwanak Mountain.</font>

825
00:52:10,552 --> 00:52:14,472
<font color="yellow">Someone just called me to let me know
that he hit my car.</font>

826
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:18,710
<font color="yellow">But the location is not the parking lot
of Gwanak Mountain.</font>

827
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,628
<font color="yellow">Could you come with me?</font>

828
00:52:23,628 --> 00:52:25,047
<font color="yellow">Yes, we will.</font>

829
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:29,786
<font color="yellow">See? I was right!</font>

830
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:33,391
<font color="yellow">She probably skipped climbing
and went right for it.</font>

831
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,275
<font color="yellow">No, she's not picking it up.</font>

832
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:50,447
<font color="yellow">Let's go outside. Let's go, let's go.</font>

833
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,001
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

834
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,822
<font color="yellow"><i>It's me. Did you call me?</i></font>

835
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:01,621
<font color="yellow">Yes. Where are you now?</font>

836
00:53:01,621 --> 00:53:02,733
<font color="yellow">She picked it up?</font>

837
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:06,599
<font color="yellow"><i>Near the office. We're in a meeting.
I'm busy, I can't talk for long.</i></font>

838
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:12,068
<font color="yellow">I told you I have filming today.
I think it'll run really late.</font>

839
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:16,768
<font color="yellow">I wanted to confirm
that you can pick up Joon Soo.</font>

840
00:53:22,434 --> 00:53:25,108
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, I should be able
to pick up Joon Soo.</i></font>

841
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:29,061
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see. What a relief.</font>

842
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:32,239
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Writer Kwon.
<i>- Where are you? Come quickly!</i></font>

843
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:33,706
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

844
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:36,971
<font color="yellow"><i>We're tracking the location of the
client's wife. We're heading over there.</i></font>

845
00:53:36,971 --> 00:53:38,820
<font color="yellow">What? All of a sudden?</font>

846
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,853
<font color="yellow"><i>It just happened.</i></font>

847
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:41,516
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know how
the situation will change</i></font>

848
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:43,181
<font color="yellow"><i>so I think it'll be hard
to cover on my own.</i></font>

849
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,280
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be there.</font>

850
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,025
<font color="yellow">- Have a good meeting.
<i>- Okay.</i></font>

851
00:53:51,025 --> 00:53:54,994
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, I should go to the location.</font>

852
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:56,994
<font color="yellow">- You can stay by yourself, right?
- Yes. I'm not a kid.</font>

853
00:53:56,994 --> 00:53:59,548
<font color="yellow">You should hurry up and go.
She says she's in a meeting.</font>

854
00:53:59,548 --> 00:54:00,952
<font color="yellow">I don't think she's coming here.</font>

855
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:03,137
<font color="yellow">So what's wrong with your face?</font>

856
00:54:04,748 --> 00:54:06,123
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

857
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:09,128
<font color="yellow">I trusted Soo Yeon no matter what.</font>

858
00:54:09,128 --> 00:54:11,231
<font color="yellow">But I can't trust her anymore.</font>

859
00:54:12,637 --> 00:54:14,152
<font color="yellow">It must be my fault.</font>

860
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:18,641
<font color="yellow">No, anyone in your situation
would feel that way.</font>

861
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:24,034
<font color="yellow">It'll be a relief if she doesn't come.</font>

862
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:26,543
<font color="yellow">But just in case, if she comes...</font>

863
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:31,775
<font color="yellow">don't be flustered. Like Yoon Ki said,
get evidence of them going in the room.</font>

864
00:54:31,775 --> 00:54:34,103
<font color="yellow">After that,
the three of you should have a talk.</font>

865
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:36,940
<font color="yellow">You should have a clean result, Hyun Woo.</font>

866
00:54:38,704 --> 00:54:41,829
<font color="yellow">- I'm leaving.
- Go. Go!</font>

867
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:43,831
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you.
- Okay.</font>

868
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:44,985
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

869
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:56,617
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

870
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:04,833
<font color="yellow">Look at the car.</font>

871
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:09,306
<font color="yellow">- This car...
- Yes, I'm the car owner.</font>

872
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,829
<font color="yellow">Yes, I scratched it here.
It was narrow on the way up.</font>

873
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:15,684
<font color="yellow">She's a real trickster.</font>

874
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:18,806
<font color="yellow">She parked the car here so that
there won't be any curtain marks.</font>

875
00:55:18,806 --> 00:55:23,141
<font color="yellow">She'd get caught right away if the motel
curtain brushed against a dusty car.</font>

876
00:55:23,141 --> 00:55:26,617
<font color="yellow">A real trickster! I told you yesterday.</font>

877
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:29,291
<font color="yellow">- Attorney Choi.
- Yes?</font>

878
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,195
<font color="yellow">You should keep your mouth shut.</font>

879
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:34,286
<font color="yellow">Writer Kwon, you're about to hit me.</font>

880
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:35,467
<font color="yellow">Can I hit you?</font>

881
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:38,132
<font color="yellow">It's not like I said anything wrong.</font>

882
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:40,153
<font color="yellow">What kind of situation is this?</font>

883
00:55:40,153 --> 00:55:44,702
<font color="yellow">This is nothing. If you'd leave us with
your number, we'll call you later.</font>

884
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:49,369
<font color="yellow">We'll call you. Don't worry too much.</font>

885
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:50,757
<font color="yellow">Bye now.</font>

886
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:58,155
<font color="yellow">Would she be at this hotel?</font>

887
00:56:01,143 --> 00:56:05,539
<font color="yellow">Please calm down. Let's go back
to the car and think carefully.</font>

888
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:07,105
<font color="yellow">This way please.</font>

889
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:11,081
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, over here!</font>

890
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:14,384
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

891
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:16,514
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming now?</font>

892
00:56:18,985 --> 00:56:21,237
<font color="yellow">There is nothing certain as of yet.</font>

893
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:23,489
<font color="yellow">We don't know if your wife
is in that hotel.</font>

894
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:26,719
<font color="yellow">First, you should call your wife.</font>

895
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,719
<font color="yellow">Tell her that you got a call
about someone hitting the car</font>

896
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,190
<font color="yellow">and see what she says.</font>

897
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,371
<font color="yellow"><i>Hyun Woo, how did it go? Did she come?</i></font>

898
00:56:37,072 --> 00:56:38,708
<font color="yellow"><i>[My love Hee Ok]</i></font>

899
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:47,690
<font color="yellow">Honey, it's me.</font>

900
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:51,469
<font color="yellow">I just got a call from someone
that he scratched my car.</font>

901
00:56:51,469 --> 00:56:55,445
<font color="yellow">Can you check? Yes, I have his number.</font>

902
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,900
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

903
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,510
<font color="yellow">She said she'd check.</font>

904
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,489
<font color="yellow">Gwanak Mountain is
a bit far from here, right?</font>

905
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:05,976
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

906
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:09,646
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you see her or what?</i></font>

907
00:57:09,646 --> 00:57:11,030
<font color="yellow">Someone's coming out!</font>

908
00:57:14,528 --> 00:57:16,438
<font color="yellow">Is that your wife?</font>

909
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:19,889
<font color="yellow">That...</font>

910
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:20,961
<font color="yellow">Producer Ahn!</font>

911
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,434
<font color="yellow">Attorney Choi, aren't you getting out?</font>

912
00:57:29,434 --> 00:57:33,213
<font color="yellow">This is a bullet-proof window!
I'm not getting off!</font>

913
00:57:33,213 --> 00:57:35,012
<font color="yellow">What? What did you say?</font>

914
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,804
<font color="yellow">I'm getting off.</font>

915
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,483
<font color="yellow">I just did that for no reason.</font>

916
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,121
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

917
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:52,405
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

918
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:54,500
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Who are these people?</font>

919
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,179
<font color="yellow">I'm asking who this man is!</font>

920
00:57:56,179 --> 00:57:57,750
<font color="yellow">Didn't you come here knowing everything?</font>

921
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,108
<font color="yellow">Stop with the camera!</font>

922
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,873
<font color="yellow">Who are these people?</font>

923
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:04,820
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm the main producer
Ahn Joon Young...</font>

924
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,978
<font color="yellow">I don't think you'd
accept my business card.</font>

925
00:58:06,978 --> 00:58:09,965
<font color="yellow">Your husband asked for help
from our program.</font>

926
00:58:09,965 --> 00:58:12,251
<font color="yellow">Did you ask them to follow me?</font>

927
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:14,219
<font color="yellow">Producer...</font>

928
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:18,155
<font color="yellow">What the heck? Get rid of the cameras!
I'll break all of them!</font>

929
00:58:18,155 --> 00:58:20,797
<font color="yellow">I'm a lawyer.
Since it's a matter between these two</font>

930
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,438
<font color="yellow">please leave them to have a talk.</font>

931
00:58:23,438 --> 00:58:24,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, you should go, Honey.
I'll call you--</font>

932
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,360
<font color="yellow">"Honey"? Have you lost your mind?</font>

933
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,478
<font color="yellow">- Don't yell at me!
- Why? Are you embarrassed?</font>

934
00:58:28,478 --> 00:58:29,905
<font color="yellow">You know it's embarrassing?</font>

935
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:32,748
<font color="yellow">You're laughing? You're laughing?</font>

936
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:37,954
<font color="yellow">Why don't we go somewhere quiet?</font>

937
00:58:37,954 --> 00:58:41,815
<font color="yellow">We don't record anything
without your permission.</font>

938
00:58:41,815 --> 00:58:44,978
<font color="yellow">We just want
to listen to your conversation.</font>

939
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:48,297
<font color="yellow">But if you feel uncomfortable,
we'll leave you.</font>

940
00:58:48,297 --> 00:58:50,748
<font color="yellow">No, let's do it.</font>

941
00:58:50,748 --> 00:58:53,684
<font color="yellow">Whether it's a talk or filming,
let's do it.</font>

942
00:58:53,684 --> 00:58:56,574
<font color="yellow">Why don't we go? Let's go.</font>

943
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:58,159
<font color="yellow"><i>How can you have no shame?</i></font>

944
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:01,739
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to cry here then?</font>

945
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:05,175
<font color="yellow">If you did something wrong, shouldn't
you at least pretend that you're sorry?</font>

946
01:00:05,175 --> 01:00:07,275
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to pretend to be sorry?</font>

947
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:09,697
<font color="yellow">- You're seeing another man.
- I'm seeing another man, so what?</font>

948
01:00:09,697 --> 01:00:12,244
<font color="yellow">- You are a mom with a child!
- So I can't meet a man?</font>

949
01:00:12,244 --> 01:00:14,202
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?
You have a husband!</font>

950
01:00:14,202 --> 01:00:16,208
<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

951
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:19,492
<font color="yellow">If you get too upset,
you can't have a good conversation.</font>

952
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:23,163
<font color="yellow">The most important thing is
why she was having an affair.</font>

953
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:24,862
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

954
01:00:24,862 --> 01:00:26,601
<font color="yellow">Let me at least ask the reason.</font>

955
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:29,121
<font color="yellow">Why on earth did you cheat on me?</font>

956
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:35,273
<font color="yellow">- There is no reason.
- What?</font>

957
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:42,186
<font color="yellow">I just... met him when I went climbing.</font>

958
01:00:42,186 --> 01:00:44,318
<font color="yellow">He said he liked me.</font>

959
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:50,577
<font color="yellow">He wasn't bad.
So I kept in touch with him.</font>

960
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:53,382
<font color="yellow">You're a married woman!
A married woman with a husband!</font>

961
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:58,797
<font color="yellow">Then... did you do it
with a divorce in mind?</font>

962
01:00:58,797 --> 01:01:01,385
<font color="yellow">I've never considered getting a divorce.</font>

963
01:01:01,385 --> 01:01:04,831
<font color="yellow">If I do it, I will. If I don't, I won't.</font>

964
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:09,670
<font color="yellow">First, it's true that I saw another man.</font>

965
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:15,909
<font color="yellow">Now my husband found out, we have to
figure out something, divorce or not.</font>

966
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:19,056
<font color="yellow">- Even if you begged--
- Why would I beg?</font>

967
01:01:19,056 --> 01:01:20,130
<font color="yellow">It's over if we get a divorce.</font>

968
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:23,668
<font color="yellow">What about Jin Ah?
Didn't you think about our daughter?</font>

969
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:30,027
<font color="yellow">Hee Ok, we've lived together
for 15 years.</font>

970
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:32,431
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

971
01:01:34,322 --> 01:01:35,688
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

972
01:01:35,688 --> 01:01:38,588
<font color="yellow">After I started seeing him</font>

973
01:01:38,588 --> 01:01:41,489
<font color="yellow">I couldn't understand how
I've lived with you for 15 years.</font>

974
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,190
<font color="yellow">I lived like such an idiot.</font>

975
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:48,085
<font color="yellow">And I don't need our child.</font>

976
01:01:48,085 --> 01:01:51,628
<font color="yellow">To be honest, she looks like you,
so I can't stand to see her.</font>

977
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:55,105
<font color="yellow">What? Are you going to hit me?
Yes, hit me. Go ahead!</font>

978
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:57,467
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to give you alimony.
Hit me and let's call it even.</font>

979
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:59,822
<font color="yellow">Hey, hit me! I said, hit me!</font>

980
01:02:16,643 --> 01:02:18,443
<font color="yellow">She's something.</font>

981
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,074
<font color="yellow">Of course, you're number one!</font>

982
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,864
<font color="yellow"><i>If I loved him,
I shouldn't have run away.</i></font>

983
01:02:50,864 --> 01:02:54,719
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if I'd end up breaking up with him,
I should've made it clear.</i></font>

984
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:22,407
<font color="yellow"><i>If they get on, I can't find out
which floor they get off. What do I do?</i></font>

985
01:03:24,144 --> 01:03:26,547
<font color="yellow"><i>I wonder what excuse
Toycrane's wife will have.</i></font>

986
01:03:26,547 --> 01:03:29,463
<font color="yellow"><i>What excuse could she possibly have?
Secure the evidence and get a divorce.</i></font>

987
01:03:29,463 --> 01:03:32,143
<font color="yellow"><i>He's pathetic for going to the hotel
to catch them in the act.</i></font>

988
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:33,197
<font color="yellow"><i>She must've cheated on him
because he's pathetic.</i></font>

989
01:03:33,197 --> 01:03:35,050
<font color="yellow"><i>Which bridge
is the closest to the hotel?</i></font>

990
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,128
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll be waiting for you at the
seventh pier of Sungsan Bridge.</i></font>

991
01:03:37,128 --> 01:03:38,773
<font color="yellow"><i>All of the losers in the world...</i></font>

post a photo to prove it.</i></font>

01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,876
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm at J Hotel now.
I don't think this is it.</i></font>

994
01:03:41,876 --> 01:03:43,882
<font color="yellow"><i>Take a picture of the guy.
We should bury him alive.</i></font>

995
01:03:51,237 --> 01:03:53,393
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's just stop them first!</i></font>
