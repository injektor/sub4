<font color="yellow">This is what you saw.</font>

<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

13
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:03,851
<font color="yellow">I see it, too.</font>

14
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,551
<font color="yellow">The thing you saw.</font>

15
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,011
<font color="yellow">Hello, Geum Bi.</font>

16
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,051
<font color="yellow">Your dad sent you a present.</font>

17
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,781
<font color="yellow">I heard it's your birthday today.</font>

18
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,781
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday to you</font>

19
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,721
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday... Happy birthday to you</font>

20
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:39,221
<font color="yellow">I wonder what's in here.</font>

21
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,181
<font color="yellow">You must be really happy, Eun Soo.</font>

22
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,981
<font color="yellow">Eun Soo, do you want to get a shot now?</font>

23
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:52,381
<font color="yellow">Get lost. I'm not getting a shot from you.</font>

24
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,081
<font color="yellow">Eun Soo.</font>

25
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,581
<font color="yellow">Get the intern guy to come.</font>

26
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:00,381
<font color="yellow">The interns have a lot of things to do.</font>

27
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,081
<font color="yellow">You can't even locate the vein.</font>

28
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:05,581
<font color="yellow">You'll only make it hurt more.</font>

29
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:07,551
<font color="yellow">You're a mean brat, aren't you?</font>

30
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,611
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

31
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,611
<font color="yellow">Why would I be at a hospital if I wanted to?</font>

32
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,211
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, children?</font>

33
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,411
<font color="yellow">You should be friendly toward each other.</font>

34
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:18,151
<font color="yellow">Stay out of this, Mister.</font>

35
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:20,911
<font color="yellow">Eun Soo. The interns are really busy.</font>

36
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,981
<font color="yellow">- They don't have the time. - And?</font>

37
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,251
<font color="yellow">Have they got less time than me?</font>

38
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,151
<font color="yellow">Eun Soo.</font>

39
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:28,911
<font color="yellow">I'm going to die soon.</font>

40
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,181
<font color="yellow">And they have less time than me?</font>

41
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:41,251
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you because of Geum Bi.</font>

42
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:45,081
<font color="yellow">Until the gene therapy gets completed,</font>

43
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,751
<font color="yellow">we'll have to find a way for Geum Bi to hang in there.</font>

44
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,911
<font color="yellow">Do you know a way?</font>

45
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:53,951
<font color="yellow">I'm going to inject her with cyclodextrin...</font>

46
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,181
<font color="yellow">in her spinal cord.</font>

47
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,351
<font color="yellow">The side effects will be too severe.</font>

48
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,451
<font color="yellow">If it's effective,</font>

49
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:06,551
<font color="yellow">we should put up with the side effects.</font>

50
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:09,481
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's not like...</font>

51
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,381
<font color="yellow">every patient develops side effects.</font>

52
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:15,451
<font color="yellow">She could lose her sense of hearing.</font>

53
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,211
<font color="yellow">There might be other side effects yet to be discovered.</font>

54
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:27,021
<font color="yellow">If it'll slow down the disease,</font>

55
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:28,151
<font color="yellow">we should give it a try.</font>

56
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,151
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

57
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,881
<font color="yellow">- Hwi Cheol. - He said it's dangerous.</font>

58
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,481
<font color="yellow">She's already sick.</font>

59
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,311
<font color="yellow">What if she loses her hearing?</font>

60
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,181
<font color="yellow">I'll pretend I didn't hear this.</font>

61
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,811
<font color="yellow">I heard you have dementia.</font>

62
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,681
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

63
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:47,851
<font color="yellow">I envy you.</font>

64
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:49,111
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

65
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:51,151
<font color="yellow">You'll lose your memory.</font>

66
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,151
<font color="yellow">Don't glare at me.</font>

67
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,011
<font color="yellow">I really do envy you.</font>

68
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,011
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

69
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:01,481
<font color="yellow">Over time,</font>

70
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,411
<font color="yellow">you'll forget that you're sick...</font>

71
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,611
<font color="yellow">and that you'll die.</font>

72
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:12,551
<font color="yellow">You can live and die in peace.</font>

73
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:16,481
<font color="yellow">I'm in peace right now.</font>

74
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,151
<font color="yellow">That's because you don't know what it means to die.</font>

75
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:30,381
<font color="yellow">No! Ji Eun! Don't die!</font>

76
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,381
<font color="yellow">No, don't!</font>

77
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,081
<font color="yellow">Don't take her!</font>

78
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,981
<font color="yellow">No, don't do it!</font>

79
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:37,511
<font color="yellow">Don't!</font>

80
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,011
<font color="yellow">You can't take her!</font>

81
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,311
<font color="yellow">Your dad doesn't know, either.</font>

82
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,151
<font color="yellow">You probably know better than him.</font>

83
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:09,011
<font color="yellow">Did you become friends with her?</font>

84
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:14,411
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

85
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:17,451
<font color="yellow">What happens when I die?</font>

86
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:32,051
<font color="yellow">What happens when I die?</font>

87
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,451
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

88
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,651
<font color="yellow">I'm curious.</font>

89
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,551
<font color="yellow">Why would you be curious about that?</font>

90
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,011
<font color="yellow">I've died a few times,</font>

91
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,211
<font color="yellow">and it was nothing.</font>

92
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,381
<font color="yellow">When I play games at the arcade,</font>

93
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,151
<font color="yellow">I die at least three times per game.</font>

94
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:56,881
<font color="yellow">Stop joking around.</font>

95
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:59,311
<font color="yellow">What happens when I die?</font>

96
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:03,281
<font color="yellow">My gosh, you should be thinking about getting better.</font>

97
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,111
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that you'll die?</font>

98
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,151
<font color="yellow">I'm not just ill.</font>

99
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,211
<font color="yellow">You're here because you're ill.</font>

100
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,681
<font color="yellow">Why else would you be here?</font>

101
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:13,311
<font color="yellow">I'll die.</font>

102
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,551
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

103
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:28,711
<font color="yellow">What happens after people die?</font>

104
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:33,281
<font color="yellow">What happens after people die?</font>

105
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,581
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

106
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,511
<font color="yellow">if you do good deeds,</font>

107
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,211
<font color="yellow">you'll be at a good place.</font>

108

109
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:56,251
<font color="yellow">When I die, I'll go to a good place.</font>

110
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,211
<font color="yellow">(When I die, I'll go to a good place.)</font>

111
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,551
<font color="yellow">It's so close.</font>

112
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,121
<font color="yellow">Why won't they come?</font>

113
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:03,881
<font color="yellow">Is this your place or something?</font>

114
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,881
<font color="yellow">Not bad. You found me.</font>

115
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,081
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

116
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:12,051
<font color="yellow">Why do you care?</font>

117
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,081
<font color="yellow">I'm 13.</font>

118
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:18,081
<font color="yellow">I'll be 13 in 2 years.</font>

119
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,551
<font color="yellow">You're much younger.</font>

120
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,051
<font color="yellow">What? You're just two years older.</font>

121
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:26,581
<font color="yellow">I'm only two years older than you,</font>

122
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,111
<font color="yellow">but I've done everything that you are doing right now.</font>

123
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:32,251
<font color="yellow">How do you feel now that you've asked people?</font>

124
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:34,511
<font color="yellow">Are you less scared?</font>

125
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:49,251
<font color="yellow">What about this picture? Have you seen it?</font>

126
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:50,711
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

127
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:53,851
<font color="yellow">Stop lying.</font>

128
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,751
<font color="yellow">Kids who'll die soon...</font>

129
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,581
<font color="yellow">see those pictures in stages.</font>

130
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,481
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know what else I've seen?</font>

131
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,451
<font color="yellow">If you're curious,</font>

132
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:09,451
<font color="yellow">don't sleep at night and wait for me.</font>

133
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:21,681
<font color="yellow">Did she really ask you that?</font>

134
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,751
<font color="yellow">My mind went blank,</font>

135
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,511
<font color="yellow">and I couldn't say anything.</font>

136
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:33,451
<font color="yellow">I'm so old, yet I couldn't even answer her.</font>

137
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,081
<font color="yellow">She went through a lot within a short period.</font>

138
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,981
<font color="yellow">We have to create a safe environment,</font>

139
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:42,881
<font color="yellow">so she won't think of anything bad.</font>

140
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:44,181
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

141
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,751
<font color="yellow">I'll have to adopt her first.</font>

142
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:50,781
<font color="yellow">Yes. Get ready for the interview.</font>

143
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,751
<font color="yellow">They will ask a lot of questions.</font>

144
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:58,111
<font color="yellow">Above all, they'll want to know how you'll support her.</font>

145
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,311
<font color="yellow">If your finances seem unstable,</font>

146
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,081
<font color="yellow">they won't let you adopt her.</font>

147
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,051
<font color="yellow">A business?</font>

148
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:22,581
<font color="yellow">I had a hundred different thoughts...</font>

149
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,311
<font color="yellow">when I saw the tree you made on Christmas.</font>

150
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,981
<font color="yellow">Jae Gyung and I decided to do that.</font>

151
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,381
<font color="yellow">I guess you're growing up, too.</font>

152
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,881
<font color="yellow">You should join us.</font>

153
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,311
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

154
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,211
<font color="yellow">I can't afford an office.</font>

155
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,111
<font color="yellow">It's as if we have an office already.</font>

156
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:42,581
<font color="yellow">It's a bit complicated.</font>

157
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,351
<font color="yellow">Hey, trust me.</font>

<font color="yellow">If you ever call me Mister again,</font>

316
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:57,051
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stitch your mouth up.</font>

317
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:03,951
<font color="yellow">Haven't we met before?</font>

318
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:13,511
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare touch her.</font>

319
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:15,481
<font color="yellow">I'll put you down.</font>

320
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:17,711
<font color="yellow">I won't send Geum Bi away.</font>

321
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:21,251
<font color="yellow">If you stop her from coming to school,</font>

322
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,881
<font color="yellow">I'm quitting school, too.</font>

323
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,451
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

324
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:09,681
<font color="yellow">I'll die before you do.</font>

325
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:13,611
<font color="yellow">If I don't get a heart transplant,</font>

326
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:15,651
<font color="yellow">I might die tomorrow.</font>

327
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:20,811
<font color="yellow">But my so-called dad won't even visit me.</font>

328
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:25,081
<font color="yellow">It's like he's saying that we are better gone.</font>

329
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,651
<font color="yellow">I thought that was the case, too.</font>

330
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:36,011
<font color="yellow">When I first found out about my disease,</font>

331
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:38,411
<font color="yellow">I cried every single day.</font>

332
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:41,581
<font color="yellow">I was scared and angry.</font>

333
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:44,881
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

334
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,681
<font color="yellow">as I think about stuff in here,</font>

335
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:51,881
<font color="yellow">I met my dad after I got sick.</font>

336
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:54,811
<font color="yellow">A lot of good things happened, too.</font>

337
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:56,611
<font color="yellow">Nonsense.</font>

338
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,451
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're so different?</font>

339
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:01,781
<font color="yellow">If you're different from me,</font>

340
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:03,951
<font color="yellow">why are you crying?</font>

341
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,281
<font color="yellow">I no longer felt scared...</font>

342
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:12,011
<font color="yellow">after I thought about Dad.</font>

343
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:15,651
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

344
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,981
<font color="yellow">I can't stop crying after I realized...</font>

345
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,881
<font color="yellow">that I'll never see him again.</font>

346
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:28,951
<font color="yellow">You're crying because you're scared.</font>

347
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:32,381
<font color="yellow">If you die, everything is over, including your dad.</font>

348
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:34,711
<font color="yellow">When you die,</font>

349
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:37,781
<font color="yellow">your dad will forget about you very quickly.</font>

350
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:45,011
<font color="yellow">If he forgets me, that'll be very sad.</font>

351
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,011
<font color="yellow">But it's okay.</font>

352
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:53,081
<font color="yellow">He's been really good to me.</font>

353
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,881
<font color="yellow">He's not even my real dad.</font>

354
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:02,651
<font color="yellow">Before I realized he wasn't my dad,</font>

355
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:06,311
<font color="yellow">I kept complaining that he treated me badly,</font>

356
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,411
<font color="yellow">and that he was ugly.</font>

357
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:18,811
<font color="yellow">We fought on that rainy night in the tent.</font>

358
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:21,811
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

359
00:31:23,611 --> 00:31:26,111
<font color="yellow">I still liked everything even after knowing...</font>

360
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:28,351
<font color="yellow">that he's not my real dad.</font>

361
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:36,511
<font color="yellow">Dad doesn't care if I'm his real daughter or not.</font>

362
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,511
<font color="yellow">I guess death isn't all that bad.</font>

363
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:45,881
<font color="yellow">Thanks to my disease,</font>

364
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:48,751
<font color="yellow">I met Dad and Kang Hee.</font>

365
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:51,181
<font color="yellow">I found my mom, too.</font>

366
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:53,881
<font color="yellow">I kissed Jae Ha,</font>

367
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:56,481
<font color="yellow">and Chi Soo became a good guy.</font>

368
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,551
<font color="yellow">It's like getting disappointed...</font>

369
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,251
<font color="yellow">on a picnic day because it rained,</font>

370
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:04,051
<font color="yellow">but you feel better because the sun came back.</font>

371
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:08,181
<font color="yellow">Thinking about that...</font>

372
00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:10,681
<font color="yellow">made me cry.</font>

373
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,881
<font color="yellow">You should think about it.</font>

374
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,881
<font color="yellow">I'm sure good things happened after you were sick.</font>

375
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:21,611
<font color="yellow">My mom said...</font>

376
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:25,951
<font color="yellow">everyone just lives every day preparing for tomorrow.</font>

377
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:30,151
<font color="yellow">One day, a day without tomorrow will come their way.</font>

378
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:35,181
<font color="yellow">That's why we should be happy about today.</font>

379
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:38,451
<font color="yellow">I think she's right.</font>

380
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:42,781
<font color="yellow">But why am I so sleepy?</font>

381
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:45,251
<font color="yellow">I want to go out now.</font>

382
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:09,381
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

383
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:12,311
<font color="yellow">That troublemaker.</font>

384
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:14,611
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

385
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,281
<font color="yellow">I told you not to be exposed to cold air.</font>

386
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:19,611
<font color="yellow">Do you want to live here forever?</font>

387
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,881
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Geum Bi.</font>

388
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:31,051
<font color="yellow">Why are you smiling?</font>

389
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:34,311
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried we were?</font>

390
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:40,411
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, where have you been?</font>

391
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,751
<font color="yellow">To the funeral hall.</font>

392
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:48,181
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

393
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,011
<font color="yellow">I lied inside of a coffin.</font>

394
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:56,451
<font color="yellow">You must be joking, Geum Bi.</font>

395
00:33:58,781 --> 00:34:00,881
<font color="yellow">I went to the morgue and...</font>

396
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,311
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

397
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:06,181
<font color="yellow">Why would you lie in a coffin?</font>

398
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,111
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

399
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,011
<font color="yellow">Did Eun Soo...</font>

400
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:14,281
<font color="yellow">She talked you into this, right?</font>

401
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:15,881
<font color="yellow">I knew it!</font>

402
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,611
<font color="yellow">I walked in by myself.</font>

403
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:22,011
<font color="yellow">Why, Geum Bi? Why did you do that?</font>

404
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:25,151
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd understand...</font>

405
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,381
<font color="yellow">what death is by pretending to die.</font>

406
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:37,581
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

407
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:40,151
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd be scared,</font>

408
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:43,951
<font color="yellow">but it wasn't just scary.</font>

409
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:46,151
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

410
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:48,681
<font color="yellow">What's with you?</font>

411
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:51,481
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

412
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,881
<font color="yellow">Don't ever go in there by yourself again.</font>

413
00:34:58,011 --> 00:34:59,781
<font color="yellow">Go in with me.</font>

414
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:01,381
<font color="yellow">Don't go in by yourself.</font>

415
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,111
<font color="yellow">What did I say?</font>

416
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,011
<font color="yellow">We do everything together.</font>

417
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,251
<font color="yellow">Live or die, you do it with me.</font>

418
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,651
<font color="yellow">Did you forget already?</font>

419

<font color="yellow">You're so ugly.</font>

423

<font color="yellow">You're ugly even after you washed your face.</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't forget.</font>

<font color="yellow">Good luck, Geum Bi. Do your best.</font>

629
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:15,981
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

630
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:19,781
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.</font>

631
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:24,111
<font color="yellow">I said wait for me.</font>

632
00:55:25,551 --> 00:55:26,881
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

633
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:31,481
<font color="yellow">Stop following me.</font>

634
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:36,451
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

635
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:40,951
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.</font>

636
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:53,711
<font color="yellow">Don't come closer.</font>

637
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,111
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come with me?</font>

638
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:29,481
<font color="yellow">You're so ugly.</font>

639
00:56:44,011 --> 00:56:46,811
<font color="yellow">Once upon a time, in a small village,</font>

640
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,951
<font color="yellow">there lived a little girl with a glass heart.</font>

641
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:53,251
<font color="yellow">One day, small cracks...</font>

642
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:56,381
<font color="yellow">began to appear in the girl's heart.</font>

643
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:02,281
<font color="yellow">Her warm heart slowly began to grow cold.</font>

644
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:07,351
<font color="yellow">The girl's father ran all over the place...</font>

645
00:57:07,351 --> 00:57:09,111
<font color="yellow">to find her a new heart.</font>

646
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:13,481
<font color="yellow">But everyone needed their heart,</font>

647
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,781
<font color="yellow">so no one would give him one.</font>

648
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:20,481
<font color="yellow">As time passed, the girl began to resent...</font>

649
00:57:20,481 --> 00:57:23,681
<font color="yellow">the father who always left her alone.</font>

650
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:26,881
<font color="yellow">Her father came to a realization...</font>

651
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:31,111
<font color="yellow">only when the girl's heart almost lost all warmth.</font>

652
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:34,511
<font color="yellow">He realized that instead of swapping her heart,</font>

653
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:37,411
<font color="yellow">he needed to blow warmth back into it.</font>

654
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:42,151
<font color="yellow">The girl's father held the girl tight...</font>

655
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:46,781
<font color="yellow">and put his heart close to hers.</font>

656
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:56,111
<font color="yellow">The girl's father...</font>

657
00:57:57,281 --> 00:57:59,011
<font color="yellow">wished that...</font>

658
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:02,711
<font color="yellow">the girl's heart would fill with warmth...</font>

659
00:58:03,451 --> 00:58:04,751
<font color="yellow">as he said...</font>

660
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:18,881
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

661
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:22,181
<font color="yellow">so foolish.</font>

662
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:26,681
<font color="yellow">Can you forgive me?</font>

663
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:15,451
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

664
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:18,251
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

665
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:20,111
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

666
00:59:20,551 --> 00:59:21,751
<font color="yellow">Promise me something.</font>

667
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:25,811
<font color="yellow">What? What is it this time?</font>

668
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:30,051
<font color="yellow">Later on, when I'm very sick,</font>

669
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:35,511
<font color="yellow">I will forget everything...</font>

670
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:38,981
<font color="yellow">and not know what's going on.</font>

671
00:59:39,881 --> 00:59:41,311
<font color="yellow">I'll become like that.</font>

672
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,311
<font color="yellow">When that happens,</font>

673
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:49,581
<font color="yellow">don't operate on me...</font>

674
00:59:50,411 --> 00:59:51,781
<font color="yellow">or do anything painful to me.</font>

675
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:55,551
<font color="yellow">I hope you won't do anything like that.</font>

676
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,811
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to promise you that?</font>

677
01:00:05,611 --> 01:00:06,811
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

678
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,681
<font color="yellow">when I die,</font>

679
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,151
<font color="yellow">cry only for a bit.</font>

680
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:24,311
<font color="yellow">Don't think of it for too long.</font>

681
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:41,481
<font color="yellow">Men,</font>

682
01:00:42,981 --> 01:00:44,111
<font color="yellow">especially dads,</font>

683
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:47,981
<font color="yellow">don't make promises we can't keep.</font>

684
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:50,751
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

685
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:55,181
<font color="yellow">I'd have been upset if you'd promised right away.</font>

686
01:00:57,351 --> 01:00:58,381
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

687
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:01,611
<font color="yellow">You're so sly.</font>

688
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:05,351
<font color="yellow">You have to say one more thing.</font>

689
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:16,981
<font color="yellow">- You're so ugly. - You're so ugly.</font>

690
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:49,311
<font color="yellow">(My Fair Lady 2016)</font>

691
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:51,181
<font color="yellow">She might be fine.</font>

692
01:01:51,611 --> 01:01:53,151
<font color="yellow">She's so normal right now.</font>

693
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:55,151
<font color="yellow">She has less than 10 years to live.</font>

694
01:01:55,151 --> 01:01:56,881
<font color="yellow">You can't be so laid back.</font>

695
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,281
<font color="yellow">The spinal injections. I'll have them.</font>

696
01:01:59,551 --> 01:02:02,481
<font color="yellow">As the disease advances, her personality may change.</font>

697
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,881
<font color="yellow">She may become more aggressive and cranky...</font>

698
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:06,351
<font color="yellow">and possibly depressed.</font>

699
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,611
<font color="yellow">I won't do it.</font>

700
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:09,551
<font color="yellow">Physical therapy is hard work.</font>

701
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:11,051
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

702
01:02:11,051 --> 01:02:12,351
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

703
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:15,181
<font color="yellow">She said no. You're making things worse.</font>

704
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:19,081
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid. I'm afraid I'll end up hating her.</font>

705
01:02:19,311 --> 01:02:20,881
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

706
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,411
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can do.</font>

707
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,381
<font color="yellow">Don't give up now. Protect her to the very end.</font>

708
01:02:26,311 --> 01:02:27,651
<font color="yellow">It's tough, isn't it?</font>

709
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:29,781
<font color="yellow">Had I known it would be like this,</font>

710
01:02:29,781 --> 01:02:31,881
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have come looking for you.</font>

711
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,011
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>
