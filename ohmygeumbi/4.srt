00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,040
<font color="yellow">This time, I'll make it hard for you.</font>

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,870
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,800
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can do this.</font>

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,400
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,170
<font color="yellow">I did it!</font>

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,170
<font color="yellow">Now, you try. This one won't be that easy.</font>

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,940
<font color="yellow">This is how you do it.</font>

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,500
<font color="yellow">I can do that one.</font>

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,540
<font color="yellow">You're a natural, aren't you?</font>

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,270
<font color="yellow">- Let's go again.
- Okay.</font>

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,300
<font color="yellow">Don't move your fingers.</font>

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,440
<font color="yellow">That's not fair.</font>

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,100
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="yellow">You go.</font>

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,240
<font color="yellow">How can you not recognize your own blood?</font>

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,500
<font color="yellow">You're good at this.</font>

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,700
<font color="yellow">Do you want to join in?</font>

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,110
<font color="yellow">No way. It's a childish game.</font>

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,470
<font color="yellow">Be a little childish with two childish females.</font>

24
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,370
<font color="yellow">Why are you playing that?</font>

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,800
<font color="yellow">It's 2016.</font>

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
<font color="yellow">You must want to know where I was.</font>

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,000
<font color="yellow">Is this what I'm supposed to do?</font>

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,170
<font color="yellow">I had some urgent business to take care...</font>

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,340
<font color="yellow">It's your turn.</font>

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,370
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,600
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,870
<font color="yellow">stop stalling and join in.</font>

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,140
<font color="yellow">It's all ruined.</font>

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,370
<font color="yellow">You never do anything properly.</font>

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
<font color="yellow">Were you going to play all night?</font>

37
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,770
<font color="yellow">You said this was childish.</font>

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,300
<font color="yellow">Once you start, you have to play to the end.</font>

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,770
<font color="yellow">Start over.</font>

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,770
<font color="yellow">No. You're so childish.</font>

41
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,170
<font color="yellow">Let's play.</font>

42
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,170
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,640
<font color="yellow">Let's play.</font>

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

45
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,670
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, Geum Bi.</font>

46
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,400
<font color="yellow">Shall I tell you a story?</font>

47
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,140
<font color="yellow">Yes, please.</font>

48
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,670
<font color="yellow">Once upon a time, on an island at sea...</font>

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,170
<font color="yellow">lived a girl called Yeon Yi...</font>

50
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,340
<font color="yellow">and a boy called Jang Yi.</font>

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,100
<font color="yellow">The two always flew a kite together.</font>

52
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,870
<font color="yellow">Whenever the sun set and they had to go home,</font>

53
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,500
<font color="yellow">they never wanted to part.</font>

54
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,370
<font color="yellow">Every night, Jang Yi promised Yeon Yi that he'd buy...</font>

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,440
<font color="yellow">a yamyeongju from the far west.</font>

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,300
<font color="yellow">What's a yamyeongju?</font>

57
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,740
<font color="yellow">It's a large bead that shines in the dark.</font>

58
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,470
<font color="yellow">What then?</font>

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,140
<font color="yellow">Time passed and Yeon Yi became a young lady,</font>

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,140
<font color="yellow">and Jang Yi became a young man.</font>

61
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,800
<font color="yellow">Jang Yi left the island saying he'd come back...</font>

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,240
<font color="yellow">with a lot of money.</font>

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,100
<font color="yellow">He also promised to buy a yamyeongju.</font>

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,310
<font color="yellow">He left even though Yeon Yi told him not to...</font>

65
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,440
<font color="yellow">because she didn't want that yamyeongju.</font>

66
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,370
<font color="yellow">After that, Yeon Yi flew a kite every day...</font>

67
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,270
<font color="yellow">by the sea.</font>

68
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,170
<font color="yellow">She prayed that he would come back safely.</font>

69
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,470
<font color="yellow">He worked very hard and made...</font>

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,140
<font color="yellow">a lot of money.</font>

71
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,400
<font color="yellow">Did he buy the yamyeongju?</font>

72
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,310
<font color="yellow">Be quiet and listen.</font>

73
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,970
<font color="yellow">When he left the island, Jang Yi had told Yeon Yi...</font>

74
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,870
<font color="yellow">that he'd come back after the azaleas had bloomed...</font>

75
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,500
<font color="yellow">and then wilted five times.</font>

76
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,340
<font color="yellow">The more money he made, the greedier he became...</font>

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,340
<font color="yellow">and he didn't return after the azaleas...</font>

78
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,870
<font color="yellow">had bloomed over 10 times.</font>

79
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,100
<font color="yellow">That's bad of him.</font>

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,570
<font color="yellow">Why is that bad?</font>

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,870
<font color="yellow">Things happen when you're trying to make money.</font>

82
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,170
<font color="yellow">Then one day,</font>

83
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,310
<font color="yellow">Jang Yi finally bought a yamyeongju from the far west.</font>

84
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,440
<font color="yellow">He decided it was time to return to Yeon Yi.</font>

85
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,540
<font color="yellow">Did he go back?</font>

86
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,900
<font color="yellow">Jang Yi returned on a ship full of gold and jewels...</font>

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,340
<font color="yellow">when he saw a kite flying in the wind.</font>

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,670
<font color="yellow">He was so excited that he'd see Yeon Yi again.</font>

89
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,070
<font color="yellow">He ran up the slope calling her name...</font>

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,470
<font color="yellow">when he saw the kite was tied to a tombstone.</font>

91
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,770
<font color="yellow">In the year the azaleas had bloomed...</font>

92
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
<font color="yellow">for the seventh time,</font>

93
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,570
<font color="yellow">Yeon Yi fell sick from spending too much time...</font>

94
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,000
<font color="yellow">by the sea and died alone.</font>

95
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,370
<font color="yellow">Jang Yi was so sad and he cried...</font>

96
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,040
<font color="yellow">for days and nights by her grave. Then, he threw...</font>

97
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,140
<font color="yellow">the money, jewels and yamyeongju into the sea.</font>

98
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,940
<font color="yellow">To this day, that part of the sea glows at night...</font>

99
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,240
<font color="yellow">as if a full moon is shining under the water...</font>

100
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,270
<font color="yellow">because of the yamyeongju.</font>

101
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,600
<font color="yellow">Jang Yi was so stupid.</font>

102
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,040
<font color="yellow">He didn't know what's really important.</font>

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,700
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

106
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,840
<font color="yellow">Let's fly a kite together.</font>

107
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,670
<font color="yellow">Don't go...</font>

108
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,840
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee said breakfast is ready.</font>

109
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,600
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

110
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,140
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell? It's a kite.</font>

111
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,500
<font color="yellow">Does it fly?</font>

112
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,370
<font color="yellow">If it doesn't, it's a chicken, not a kite.</font>

<font color="yellow">(JANG YI)</font>

114
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,140
<font color="yellow">It flies really high.</font>

115
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,970
<font color="yellow">It's like a dragon.</font>

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,640
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. I want to try.</font>

117
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,170
<font color="yellow">Do you know what to do?</font>

118
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,170
<font color="yellow">I just have to let it loose.</font>

119
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,440
<font color="yellow">Then it'll crash to earth, silly.</font>

120
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,970
<font color="yellow">Hold the handle and then this part.</font>

121
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,300
<font color="yellow">Feel its movement...</font>

122
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,270
<font color="yellow">and give it room to soar or pull it back.</font>

123
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,940
<font color="yellow">Don't just release the string, okay?</font>

124
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,370
<font color="yellow">Watch it carefully. Don't let it crash.</font>

125
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,800
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

126
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,740
<font color="yellow">Pull on the string.</font>

127
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,940
<font color="yellow">I envy people who are good at making things.</font>

128
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,000
<font color="yellow">It's a useless skill.</font>

129
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,070
<font color="yellow">Kites are cheap to buy.</font>

130
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,500

<font color="yellow">I'm a nobody.</font>

133
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,270
<font color="yellow">Where did you hear that story you told?</font>

134
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,440
<font color="yellow">The one from last night.</font>

135
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,670
<font color="yellow">I made it up.</font>

136
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

137
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,700
<font color="yellow">You're a terrific liar.</font>

138
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,840
<font color="yellow">You could scam people for a living.</font>

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,100
<font color="yellow">Scam people?</font>

140
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,500
<font color="yellow">You could be a writer.</font>

141
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,500
<font color="yellow">Novelists and con artists are almost the same.</font>

142
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,340
<font color="yellow">You don't know, do you?</font>

143
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,270
<font color="yellow">Know what?</font>

144
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,270
<font color="yellow">It's not often, but you sometimes shine.</font>

145
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
<font color="yellow">What does?</font>

146
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

147

<font color="yellow">My gosh!</font>

149
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,000
<font color="yellow">I knew you would do that!</font>

150
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,740
<font color="yellow">Hey. You don't do anything right, do you?</font>

151
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,170
<font color="yellow">You should've done something if you saw this coming.</font>

152
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,770
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you do anything?</font>

153
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,000
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember what I taught you?</font>

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
<font color="yellow">Were you good at everything from the start?</font>

155
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,440
<font color="yellow">I was. Since the moment I was born.</font>

156
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm not like you, then.</font>

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,870
<font color="yellow">I knew I shouldn't have made you that kite.</font>

158
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,370
<font color="yellow">Whom are you like, Geum Bi?</font>

159
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,540
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

160
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,770
<font color="yellow">Maybe my mom.</font>

161
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,670
<font color="yellow">Goblins wear nice panties</font>

162
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,770
<font color="yellow">They're tough</font>

163
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,700
<font color="yellow">They're strong</font>

164
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,670
<font color="yellow">They're made of tiger skin</font>

165
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,570
<font color="yellow">They last 2,000 years</font>

166
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,440
<font color="yellow">What are you singing about?</font>

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,140
<font color="yellow">Mister wears dirty panties</font>

168
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,940
<font color="yellow">They smell bad</font>

169
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,640
<font color="yellow">He hasn't washed them for 2,000 years</font>

170
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,840
<font color="yellow">They're dirty</font>

171
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,540
<font color="yellow">What a bad song.</font>

172
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,070
<font color="yellow">A nasty kid sings a nasty song.</font>

173
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,140
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to keep going? How about a new song?</font>

174
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,540
<font color="yellow">No, thanks.</font>

175
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,970
<font color="yellow">Fasten your seatbelt.</font>

176
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,800
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

177
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

178
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

179
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

180
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,040
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Geum Bi?</font>

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,170
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt?</font>

182
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

183
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

184
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,440
<font color="yellow">Someone must've done it on purpose.</font>

185
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,370
<font color="yellow">They don't just loosen like this.</font>

186
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,140
<font color="yellow">What do you mean someone did it on purpose?</font>

187
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,940
<font color="yellow">The bolts are so loose.</font>

188
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,570
<font color="yellow">They don't loosen this much alone from driving.</font>

189
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

190
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
<font color="yellow">Is that your mom?</font>

191
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,570
<font color="yellow">You're very beautiful.</font>

193
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,670
<font color="yellow">Have you ever come back here after graduating?</font>

194
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,900
<font color="yellow">This is my first visit.</font>

195
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,440
<font color="yellow">You didn't even graduate.</font>

196
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,870
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

197
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,800
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you.</font>

198
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,970
<font color="yellow">How is it my fault that you got expelled?</font>

199
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
<font color="yellow">You haven't changed a bit.</font>

200
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,940
<font color="yellow">All you do is make excuses and run away.</font>

201
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,340
<font color="yellow">After a while, you even forget what you did wrong.</font>

202
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,740
<font color="yellow">You do that on purpose, don't you?</font>

203
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,940
<font color="yellow">It makes you feel better.</font>

204
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

205
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,340
<font color="yellow">When are we getting back to work?</font>

206
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,570
<font color="yellow">We can't go back there. Our covers have been blown.</font>

207
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,540
<font color="yellow">We'll start over again when we find someone else.</font>

208
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,740
<font color="yellow">We should hurry before Hwi Cheol changes his mind.</font>

209
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,840
<font color="yellow">There's no need to worry about him.</font>

210
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,540
<font color="yellow">He's completely in love with that Kang Hee.</font>

211
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,870
<font color="yellow">Eat your jjajangmyeon.</font>

212
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,240
<font color="yellow">I am eating. Can't you see?</font>

213
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,970
<font color="yellow">I hope Cha Chi Soo doesn't mess it up for us.</font>

214
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

215
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,600
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about that, too.</font>

216
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
<font color="yellow">What did Hwi Cheol do so wrong by him?</font>

217
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,700
<font color="yellow">Why does Chi Soo have the upper hand all the time?</font>

218
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,300
<font color="yellow">Weren't they best friends in high school?</font>

219
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,240
<font color="yellow">What good will come out of it...</font>

220
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,640
<font color="yellow">when the people around get hurt because of you?</font>

221
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,540
<font color="yellow">I'm in debt to many people in my life,</font>

222
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,700
<font color="yellow">but they weren't anything I couldn't pay back.</font>

223
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,900
<font color="yellow">The principal was 5,000 dollars.</font>

224
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,970
<font color="yellow">Add 7 years of interest and it's 450,000 dollars.</font>

225
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,970
<font color="yellow">I'm paying back.</font>

226
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,570
<font color="yellow">Even if it takes selling away my organs.</font>

227
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,370
<font color="yellow">You can pay back all you want,</font>

228
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,540
<font color="yellow">but it won't ever be enough to forgive your sin.</font>

229
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,640
<font color="yellow">I guess I won't have to pay back at all, then.</font>

230
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,670
<font color="yellow">Nothing will ever be enough.</font>

231
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,040
<font color="yellow">Chi Soo used to play baseball.</font>

232
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,540
<font color="yellow">Professional baseball teams wanted to sign him.</font>

233
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,700
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for that incident,</font>

234
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,470
<font color="yellow">he could be playing in the major league for all I know.</font>

235
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,470
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

236
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,540
<font color="yellow">There was a huge fight in Hwi Cheol's restaurant.</font>

237
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,040
<font color="yellow">The other guy got hurt real bad.</font>

238
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,370
<font color="yellow">Chi Soo got blamed for everything.</font>

239
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,400
<font color="yellow">What about Hwi Cheol?</font>

240
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,610
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol was the one who led the fight,</font>

241
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,240
<font color="yellow">but he managed to slip out.</font>

242
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,700
<font color="yellow">If he just went to the school...</font>

243
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,370
<font color="yellow">and said something to protect Chi Soo,</font>

244
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,110
<font color="yellow">he'd be living a different life by now.</font>

245
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,870
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol lied low for months...</font>

246
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,900
<font color="yellow">and didn't show up to school.</font>

247
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,940
<font color="yellow">In the end, Chi Soo got expelled...</font>

248
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,240
<font color="yellow">and his baseball career never even began.</font>

249
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,170
<font color="yellow">After that is...</font>

250
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're here. Come over here.</font>

251
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,770
<font color="yellow">- What's this?
- I told you.</font>

252
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,170
<font color="yellow">These are the new players.</font>

253
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,270
<font color="yellow">You don't have to pay me back if you don't want to.</font>

254
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,840
<font color="yellow">I'll come take what's mine.</font>

255
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,610
<font color="yellow">Her name is Geum Bi.</font>

256
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,570
<font color="yellow">And the other one, Kang Hee.</font>

257
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,370
<font color="yellow">Am I right?</font>

258
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,500
<font color="yellow">They have nothing to do with me.</font>

259
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,770
<font color="yellow">No matter what you do,</font>

260
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,400
<font color="yellow">it's none of my business.</font>

261
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,840
<font color="yellow">You should answer your phone.</font>

262
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,640
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

263
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,370
<font color="yellow">I got an appraisal request.</font>

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,840
<font color="yellow">I'm coming for her antiques. Be ready.</font>

265
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,300
<font color="yellow">You can walk away if you're not up for it.</font>

266
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,900
<font color="yellow">There are plenty of ways to repay your debt.</font>

267
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,940
<font color="yellow">I could put that woman and the girl to good use.</font>

268
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

269
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,970
<font color="yellow">I take 10 percent.</font>

270
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,140
<font color="yellow">If you comply with my demands, I'll do as you say.</font>

271
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,640
<font color="yellow">You can walk away if you're not up for it.</font>

272
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,340
<font color="yellow">Come take them for yourself.</font>

273
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,040
<font color="yellow">Next Monday, eleven in the morning.</font>

274
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,370
<font color="yellow">What was that about 10 percent?</font>

275
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,240
<font color="yellow">It's commission.</font>

276
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,470
<font color="yellow">I feel like you're neglecting me.</font>

277
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,110
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I need to sell mine, too.</font>

278
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,170
<font color="yellow">Right. Of course.</font>

279
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,970
<font color="yellow">I can wait until you're finished with the other one.</font>

280
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,340
<font color="yellow">Are you in a hurry?</font>

281
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

282
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,040
<font color="yellow">I might not look it, but I'm broke.</font>

283
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,070
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

284
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,240
<font color="yellow">I'm kidding. Get some rest.</font>

285
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
<font color="yellow">Okay...</font>

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,900
<font color="yellow">I'm testing myself.</font>

289
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,700
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have some tteokbokki?</font>

290
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,440
<font color="yellow">I have a violin lesson.</font>

291
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,940
<font color="yellow">What time does it end?</font>

292
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,000
<font color="yellow">After that... I have Mandarin class.</font>

293
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,470
<font color="yellow">Is it fun?</font>

294
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,340
<font color="yellow">It's not, is it?</font>

295
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,970
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just come with me to eat tteokbokki?</font>

296
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,040
<font color="yellow">My mom will scold me if I skip my lessons.</font>

297
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,740
<font color="yellow">Take your pick.</font>

298
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,300
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

299
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,500

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,470
<font color="yellow">That's just silly.</font>

301
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,540
<font color="yellow">I don't have much time, okay?</font>

302
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,170
<font color="yellow">And I'm willing to spend some time with you.</font>

303
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,940
<font color="yellow">You don't look too good. Are you sick?</font>

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,940
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

305

<font color="yellow">You must be. Think carefully.</font>

306
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,170
<font color="yellow">Hold your breath and scrunch up your face.</font>

307
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,670
<font color="yellow">I feel sick.</font>

308
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,170

466
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,570
<font color="yellow">We've gotten close, haven't we?</font>

467
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,600
<font color="yellow">That's how I feel.</font>

468
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,370
<font color="yellow">I feel like I can open up to you.</font>

469
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,640
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel the same?</font>

470
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,540
<font color="yellow">You have something to say to me, don't you?</font>

471
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,170
<font color="yellow">Maybe later.</font>

472
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,140
<font color="yellow">Maybe I will later.</font>

473
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,800
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything to say at the moment.</font>

474
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,270
<font color="yellow">If you're going somewhere,</font>

475
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,970
<font color="yellow">tell me where you're going.</font>

476

<font color="yellow">Don't just disappear like last time.</font>

477
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,240
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

478
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're so annoying.</font>

479
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,170
<font color="yellow">I'm busy right now. Go play with your brother.</font>

480
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,340

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

483
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you alone?</font>

484
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,170
<font color="yellow">People get scared of me because I'm mean.</font>

485
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,370
<font color="yellow">You're lying.</font>

486
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

487
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,440
<font color="yellow">I'm bound to live alone.</font>

488
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,570
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

489
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,170
<font color="yellow">People who don't have a sense of responsibility...</font>

490

<font color="yellow">don't have the right to be loved.</font>

491

<font color="yellow">You mean like Hwi Cheol?</font>

492
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,440
<font color="yellow">Why do you think that?</font>

493
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,740
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol is actually...</font>

494
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,040

<font color="yellow">If there's a good side,</font>

499
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,140
<font color="yellow">there is also a bad side.</font>

500
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,240
<font color="yellow">If there's a nice side,</font>

501
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,510
<font color="yellow">there is also a mean side.</font>

502
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,470
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

503
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,640
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

504
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,900
<font color="yellow">there's room for a change.</font>

505
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,340
<font color="yellow">Do you want me...</font>

506
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,370
<font color="yellow">to share a secret?</font>

507
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

508
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,870
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

509
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,270
<font color="yellow">I'm a very bad person.</font>

510
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,900
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

511
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,470
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

512
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,240
<font color="yellow">I won't...</font>

513
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,640
<font color="yellow">ever hate you...</font>

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,040
<font color="yellow">even if you did very bad things.</font>

515
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,840
<font color="yellow">I know Hwi Cheol can be strange sometimes,</font>

516
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,300
<font color="yellow">but don't hate him too much.</font>

517
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,070
<font color="yellow">He can become someone better.</font>

518
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,770
<font color="yellow">Here. Try it.</font>

519
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

520
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,400
<font color="yellow">It's good. It really is.</font>

521
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,940
<font color="yellow">What? What do you mean it's been postponed?</font>

522
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,440
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

523
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,870
<font color="yellow">The faster we do it, the better.</font>

524
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,600
<font color="yellow">What? What about the new players?</font>

525
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,740
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

526
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,970
<font color="yellow">He's so rude.</font>

527
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,800
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

528
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,770
<font color="yellow">He says something came up with the new players.</font>

529
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,740
<font color="yellow">He wants to postpone it.</font>

530
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,300
<font color="yellow">I lived off my intuition for all my life.</font>

531
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,600
<font color="yellow">I told you. Something came up with the new players.</font>

532
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,570
<font color="yellow">I can't control my flying kick...</font>

00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,140
<font color="yellow">It takes months just to get there.</font>

621
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,970
<font color="yellow">That's a lie.</font>

622
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,700
<font color="yellow">It takes that long if I were to walk there.</font>

623
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,440
<font color="yellow">I'll be 2 or 3 days.</font>

624

<font color="yellow">You don't have to eat if you don't want to.</font>

625
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,900
<font color="yellow">Do you mean that?</font>

626
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,140
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

627
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,770
<font color="yellow">Take this. Before I forget.</font>

628
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:13,700
<font color="yellow">In this congenital disease, lipids accumulate.</font>

629
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,140
<font color="yellow">Only two cases were reported in Korea so far,</font>

630
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,270
<font color="yellow">making it a very rare genetic disease.</font>

631
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,700
<font color="yellow">Extraocular muscle paralysis...</font>

632
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,500
<font color="yellow">and seizures are a few of the main symptoms.</font>

633
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,640
<font color="yellow">In early stages, patients can't look up or down.</font>

634
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,940
<font color="yellow">Later on, patients suffer from epileptic seizures...</font>

635
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,040
<font color="yellow">and the stiffening of muscles.</font>

636
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,000
<font color="yellow">In serious cases, the whole body suffers muscle loss...</font>

637
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,300
<font color="yellow">as well as the loss of sight.</font>

638
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,470
<font color="yellow">It eventually leads to death.</font>

639
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,070
<font color="yellow">The patient can go into shock...</font>

640
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,270
<font color="yellow">causing all sorts of problems.</font>

641
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,670
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

642
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,640
<font color="yellow">A while ago,</font>

643
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,670
<font color="yellow">we saw a girl with an enlarged liver and spleen.</font>

<font color="yellow">Are the biopsy results out yet?</font>

645

<font color="yellow">Oh, that little girl.</font>

646
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,040
<font color="yellow">She refused the biopsy.</font>

647
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,440
<font color="yellow">Did you say 10 percent?</font>

648
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,470
<font color="yellow">You need to give me something to live off of...</font>

649
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,240
<font color="yellow">so you can use me again.</font>

650
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,100

654
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:02,900
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

655
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,740
<font color="yellow">A man who doesn't know what he did wouldn't say that.</font>

658
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:53,600

<font color="yellow">He spent all his savings.</font>

671

<font color="yellow">I'm grateful to you...</font>

672

<font color="yellow">for getting rid of those pieces of junk.</font>

<font color="yellow">we'd gotten close.</font>

677
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,740
<font color="yellow">Were you just pretending?</font>

678
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,700

<font color="yellow">Isn't it too late to feel sorry?</font>

683
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,940
<font color="yellow">Did you do it for the money?</font>

<font color="yellow">Nothing got stolen.</font>

714

716
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,970

738
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,300
