00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,400
<font color="yellow">How can you say that, you idiot?</font>

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,820
<font color="yellow">I know I did something stupid,
but I need you to find it for me.</font>

11
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,950
<font color="yellow">Why do they put up trees for Christmas?</font>

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,650
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,870
<font color="yellow">I'm not really sure.</font>

14
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,760
<font color="yellow">I think it's to look at pretty things.</font>

15

something like that.</font>

fighting with Mister Chi Soo?</font>

18

<font color="yellow">He's a bad guy.</font>

19

23

<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,620

something impossible happen?</font>

25

<font color="yellow">I can't make that happen.</font>

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,280

that seems impossible happen.</font>

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,680
<font color="yellow">I'll try.</font>

31
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,730
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,020

get me a Christmas tree.</font>

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,030

34
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,520

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,550
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

36
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,570

Have you ever seen me lie?</font>

37
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,510
<font color="yellow">I've seen you lie a lot.</font>

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,430
<font color="yellow">Right, you have.</font>

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,870
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'll really get you a tree.</font>

47
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,070

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,960
<font color="yellow">Then eat it mixed with sugar and cream.</font>

56

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

57

58
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,240
<font color="yellow">Wait until you wake up tomorrow.</font>

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,700

61
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,760
<font color="yellow">It's not bad, right?</font>

62
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,260
<font color="yellow">It's a good tree.</font>

63
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,850
<font color="yellow">You should have gone all out
if you were going to do it.</font>

64
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,850
<font color="yellow">What is this? It's a bit rough.</font>

65
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,080
<font color="yellow">It's because it's been 20 years.</font>

66
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,120
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

67
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,630
<font color="yellow">Since I put a Christmas
tree in this house.</font>

68
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,730
<font color="yellow">I've never gotten one of these before.</font>

70
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,920

71
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,990
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you going to buy one?</font>

72
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,610
<font color="yellow">No, I was just asking.</font>

73
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,480
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi would like looking at this.</font>

74
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,320
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if she could
come for a day, at least.</font>

75
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,700
<font color="yellow">That wouldn't be possible, right?</font>

76
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,080
<font color="yellow">We can see her outside.</font>

77
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,650
<font color="yellow">We can decorate a tree outside.</font>

78
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,390
<font color="yellow">A tree?</font>

79
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,910
<font color="yellow">We should let her enjoy her time now.</font>

80
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,340

it will be like next year.</font>

81
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,100
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

82
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,840
<font color="yellow">You should have told Hwi Chul right away.</font>

83
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,850
<font color="yellow">Why did you keep it hidden?</font>

84
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
<font color="yellow">You don't know what you're talking about.</font>

85
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,870
<font color="yellow">What if Hwi Chul had tried
to get revenge for his dad?</font>

86
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,910
<font color="yellow">That's what Chi Soo wants.</font>

87

<font color="yellow">Gosh, damn it.</font>

88
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,320
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

89
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,070
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time, sir.
What can I do for you?</font>

90
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,780
<font color="yellow">Lately...</font>

91
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,870
<font color="yellow">I've been having bad dreams,
so I can't sleep.</font>

92
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,660
<font color="yellow">I feel like I've wronged
your father twice.</font>

93
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

94
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,310
<font color="yellow">Someone has been digging
into your father's case.</font>

95
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,640
<font color="yellow">I was fired for being a corrupt cop.</font>

96
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,320
<font color="yellow">I was in a bad situation.</font>

97
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,330
<font color="yellow">He offered me money, so I talked.</font>

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,980
<font color="yellow">It was something I should
never have said.</font>

99
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,800
<font color="yellow">What is it about?</font>

100
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,950
<font color="yellow">You father, Detective Mo...</font>

101
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,850
<font color="yellow">he wasn't accidentally killed
by a culprit he was chasing.</font>

102
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,670
<font color="yellow">This punk...</font>

103
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,820
<font color="yellow">It was a case that
Detective Mo was working on.</font>

104
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,290
<font color="yellow">There were corrupt cops involved.</font>

105
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,010
<font color="yellow">The case started to get bigger.</font>

106
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:07,020
<font color="yellow">That gang used Detective Mo's
informant and set him up.</font>

107
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,090
<font color="yellow">His name is Gong Gil Ho.</font>

108
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,950
<font color="yellow">He was a fraud who was
Detective Mo's informant.</font>

109
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,340
<font color="yellow">I think he got something out of it too.</font>

110
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,390
<font color="yellow">Gong Gil Ho...</font>

111
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,870
<font color="yellow">Hwi Chul!</font>

112
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,690
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about revenge.</font>

113
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,350
<font color="yellow">This won't be resolved by
catching him, that's for sure.</font>

114
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,250
<font color="yellow">It was a very complicated case.</font>

115
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,810
<font color="yellow">You'll have to kill and catch
multiple people to avenge him.</font>

116
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,040
<font color="yellow">Does that make sense?</font>

117
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,590
<font color="yellow">Please, you have to stay alive, Hwi Chul.</font>

118
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, kill me.</font>

119
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,800
<font color="yellow">If killing me helps with your grudge,
then go on and do it.</font>

120
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,090
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

121
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,710
<font color="yellow">I spent 15 years with the person
who helped to kill my dad...</font>

122
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,640
<font color="yellow">No! They used me.</font>

123
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,710
<font color="yellow">They gave me false information
and used me as bait.</font>

124
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,280
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know
and I leaked it to your dad.</font>

125
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,040
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stay quiet
out of worry for myself.</font>

126
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,950
<font color="yellow">Would you have stayed put if I told you?</font>

127
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,390
<font color="yellow">Hwi Chul, please.</font>

128
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,740
<font color="yellow">Hit me and end it.</font>

129
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,340
<font color="yellow">You can't do what Chi Soo wants.</font>

130
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,230
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

131
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,510
<font color="yellow">What about your daughter?</font>

132
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,360

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,050
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

154
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:28,500

and lost all his own money.</font>

155

do you have to pay off?</font>

158

159
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,600

160
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,530
<font color="yellow">You don't even have enough for that?</font>

161
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,050
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

162
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,330
<font color="yellow">Why is it like this?</font>

163
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,960
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

164
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,590

that this is happening to me?</font>

165
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did do a lot wrong.</font>

166
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,030
<font color="yellow">I know I didn't live a good life.</font>

167
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,690
<font color="yellow">I should, at least, get a chance.</font>

168

171
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,790

and you fall into the pit</font>

entire life in the dirt.</font>

to have such terrible parents.</font>

177

able to handle your kid.</font>

181
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,630
<font color="yellow">Fish oil?</font>

182
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,090
<font color="yellow">Why are you buying one at a time?</font>

183
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,390
<font color="yellow">You should buy 12 bottles all at once.</font>

184
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,500
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll drink it.</font>

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,370

186
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,210
<font color="yellow">I'll just do one shot of the fish oil...</font>

187
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,670
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

188
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,620
<font color="yellow">It was under the bed.</font>

189
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,870
<font color="yellow">You hid it and forgot about it.</font>

190
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,290
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

191
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,940
<font color="yellow">You want to drink right now.</font>

192
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,720
<font color="yellow">Do I seem like a joke to you?</font>

193
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,440
<font color="yellow">Are you playing me for a fool?</font>

194

<font color="yellow">What right do you have
to raise your voice?</font>

195
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,430
<font color="yellow">You lost all my money.</font>

196
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,180
<font color="yellow">- What?
- How did I know?</font>

197
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,360
<font color="yellow">How could I not know when
you're talking about it so loudly?</font>

198
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,640
<font color="yellow">The dog in the next neighborhood
must have heard too.</font>

199
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,860
<font color="yellow">That was my money.</font>

200
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,090
<font color="yellow">Even the owner of the money is fine,
so why are you throwing a fit, Lady?</font>

201
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,440
<font color="yellow">It's not even your money.</font>

202
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,440
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

203
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,210
<font color="yellow">How much money did you lose?</font>

204
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,430
<font color="yellow">1.5 billion won.</font>

205
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,740
<font color="yellow">How many bicycles could I buy with that?</font>

206
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,960
<font color="yellow">Bicycles?</font>

207
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,220
<font color="yellow">You could probably buy a plane.</font>

208
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,320
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now?</font>

209
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

210
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,270

and pay me back.</font>

211
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,580
<font color="yellow">You can only drink for today.
Should I pour it for you?</font>

212
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,240
<font color="yellow">What about this could taste so good?</font>

213
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,980
<font color="yellow">- Come over here.

214
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,200
<font color="yellow">Just come here.</font>

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,570

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,590

221
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,640

222

224
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,590

225
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,090

to someone stronger than him.</font>

weakness and threaten him</font>

307
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,140
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

308
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,340
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

309
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,730

around by yourself like this?</font>

310

311
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,730
<font color="yellow">You're sick.</font>

312
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,250

313
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,900

314
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,650
<font color="yellow">Worried? No.</font>

315
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,550

316
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,260

<font color="yellow">Did you come to see me on purpose
after my dad died?</font>

381
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,910
<font color="yellow">Because you felt bad?</font>

382
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,090
<font color="yellow">Whatever the case,
it happened because I was stupid.</font>

383
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,150
<font color="yellow">So, you felt bad and
wanted to watch out for me?</font>

384

<font color="yellow">I didn't know my own place.</font>

385
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,250
<font color="yellow">I turned you into a fraud in the end.</font>

I would've turned out worse.</font>

387
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,140
<font color="yellow">Why don't you act like you normally do?</font>

388
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,970

Geum Bi if I see her.</font>

<font color="yellow">Stressed?</font>

455
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,150
<font color="yellow">When children feel neglected
or don't feel protected enough</font>

456
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,040
<font color="yellow">they get very stressed.</font>

457
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,580
<font color="yellow">Though, I'm sure Geum Bi's illness
has a large part to do with it.</font>

458
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,040
<font color="yellow">I don't know where she was trying to go.</font>

459
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,200
<font color="yellow">It seems like the sleepwalking
manifested in an attempt to return home.</font>

460
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,490
<font color="yellow">Return home?</font>

461
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,920
<font color="yellow">A strong desire to return home.</font>

462
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,570
<font color="yellow">That's what it was.</font>

463
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,030
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to work today?</font>

464
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,670
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not.</font>

465
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,480
<font color="yellow">Is it okay not to?</font>

466
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,260
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can a person work every day?</font>

467
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,490
<font color="yellow">They need to play too.</font>

468
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,910
<font color="yellow">But you play all the time.</font>

469
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,100
<font color="yellow">I haven't played with you.</font>

470
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,820
<font color="yellow">Did you find anything?</font>

471
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,100
<font color="yellow">Is it that hard?</font>

472
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,780
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

473
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,780
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay. I'll come with you.</font>

474
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,910
<font color="yellow">Don't hit me!</font>

475
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,110
<font color="yellow">- Is he gone?
- Yes.</font>

476
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,920
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you have anything on him?</font>

477
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,130
<font color="yellow">Did you look into him back then?</font>

478
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,160
<font color="yellow">I lost him.</font>

479
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,960
<font color="yellow">Just go catch Mo Hwi Chul first, okay?</font>

480
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir!</font>

481
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,590
<font color="yellow"><i>This caller is unavailable...</i></font>

482
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,270
<font color="yellow">Hwi Chul.</font>

483
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:34,330
<font color="yellow">All I want... is for you to
live just like your name.</font>

484
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,540
<font color="yellow">I got it, okay?</font>

485
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,370
<font color="yellow">You and your lectures.</font>

486
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,650
<font color="yellow">Aren't you looking for me?</font>

487
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,750
<font color="yellow">Call Hwi Chul and tell him to run!</font>

488
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,540
<font color="yellow">Get him! Get him now!</font>

489
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,550
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

490
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,750
<font color="yellow">Not you again.</font>

491
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,450
<font color="yellow">Who told you to make that mess?</font>

492
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,050
<font color="yellow">What a pain this is.</font>

493
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,360
<font color="yellow">What about that Hwi Chul or Gye Chul?</font>

494
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,940
<font color="yellow">We have not found him yet.</font>

495
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,020
<font color="yellow">I've heard the situation.</font>

496
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,470
<font color="yellow">How did that happen?</font>

497
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,930
<font color="yellow"><i>[CHA CHI SOO]</i></font>

498
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,070
<font color="yellow"><i>This is Mo Hwi Chul, right?</i></font>

499
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,980
<font color="yellow"><i>Where are you?</i></font>

500
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,850
<font color="yellow">If you call the police or anyone...</font>

501
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,480
<font color="yellow">you will die.</font>

502
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,350
<font color="yellow">Hey! Stop!</font>

503
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,960
<font color="yellow">Are you Hwi Chul? Detective Mo's son?</font>

504
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is so absurd.</font>

505
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,330
<font color="yellow">Let that guy go.</font>

506
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,580
<font color="yellow">Stop showing off.</font>

507
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,240
<font color="yellow">Look, Detective Mo's son.</font>

508
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,510
<font color="yellow">You're not in a position to
tell me to do this or that.</font>

509
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,330
<font color="yellow">You killed my father, didn't you?</font>

510
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:26,540
<font color="yellow">But I'm here kneeling in front of you.</font>

511
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,950
<font color="yellow">Let that punk go.</font>

512
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,540
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

513
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,640
<font color="yellow">If you get to know him, he's not someone
who should be in a place like this.</font>

514
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,180
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

515
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,280
<font color="yellow">If it were not for me,
he'd be in the major leagues.</font>

516
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,720
<font color="yellow">Major leagues?</font>

517
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,640
<font color="yellow">Boss, do you have some time?</font>

518
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,660
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

519
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,270
<font color="yellow">If you have some time,
I'll tell you a fun story.</font>

520
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,980
<font color="yellow">It's kind of long though.</font>

521
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,780
<font color="yellow">If you're going to leave in
the middle, I won't even start.</font>

522
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,780
<font color="yellow">Get started, then.</font>

523
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,770
<font color="yellow">God is love.</font>

524
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:26,760
<font color="yellow">Today's mass is a daytime mass in
honor of the birth of Jesus Christ.</font>

525
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:33,030
<font color="yellow">As we joyfully greet Jesus who
came to us in the lowest form as a baby</font>

526
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,960
<font color="yellow">let us start this mass.</font>

527
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,450
<font color="yellow">Brothers and sisters.</font>

528
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:42,360
<font color="yellow">Let us partake in the wonder of
salvation by reflecting on our sins.</font>

529
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:22,710
<font color="yellow">Are we not allowed to eat that?</font>

530
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,700
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

531
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,200
<font color="yellow">Why are we here anyway?</font>

532
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,850
<font color="yellow">It's Christmas.</font>

533
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,830
<font color="yellow">It's a day when the
impossible can happen.</font>

534
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,510
<font color="yellow">And you know that person there?</font>

535
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,190
<font color="yellow">The priest?</font>

536
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,680
<font color="yellow">He looks very much
like your biological father.</font>

537
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,200
<font color="yellow">The kid... she has Alzheimer's?</font>

538
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,300
<font color="yellow">Hong Shil La?</font>

539
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,080
<font color="yellow">Hong Shil La?</font>

540
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,300
<font color="yellow">That was a lie.</font>

541
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,630
<font color="yellow">Shil La is a friend
in his daughter's class.</font>

542
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,010
<font color="yellow">Her dad is the chief prosecutor.</font>

543
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,740
<font color="yellow">To be precise...</font>

544
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,500
<font color="yellow">she doesn't have Alzheimer's.
It's called Neimann-Pick.</font>

545
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,620
<font color="yellow">Well, that's how it is.</font>

546
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:54,860
<font color="yellow">I'm in the wrong, so just let him go.</font>

547
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,670
<font color="yellow">Is he telling the truth?</font>

548
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:00,090
<font color="yellow">Stop pretending to be so cool
and go live well with your kid.</font>

549
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,110
<font color="yellow">I was very late.</font>

550
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,720
<font color="yellow">What changes if you show up now?</font>

551
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,210
<font color="yellow">If I had shown up earlier,
neither of us would be in this state.</font>

552
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,190
<font color="yellow">It's too late for that.</font>

553
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

554
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,400
<font color="yellow">Look at these two filming a
romance scene in front of me.</font>

555
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,260
<font color="yellow">I understand the whole issue.</font>

556
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,650
<font color="yellow">I have an image to uphold.</font>

557
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,040
<font color="yellow">I can't just stand by and
let people who mess with me go.</font>

558
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,750
<font color="yellow">Between the two of you, I need one.</font>

559
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,230
<font color="yellow">A finger... cut off a finger.</font>

560
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,280
<font color="yellow">Then I will just overlook everything.</font>

561
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,270
<font color="yellow">I'll send you both home.</font>

562
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,380
<font color="yellow">Fine, cut it off. Cut it off.</font>

563
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,910
<font color="yellow">Which one? This one?</font>

564
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,530
<font color="yellow">All right. Cut yours off, then.</font>

565
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can you say that?</font>

566
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,900
<font color="yellow">You don't play baseball anymore.
You don't need fingers.</font>

567
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,630
<font color="yellow">It'll hurt.</font>

568
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,860
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it hurt for me?
I'm very sensitive.</font>

569
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,630
<font color="yellow">You said you would do it.</font>

570
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,730
<font color="yellow">I was just saying it.</font>

571
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,660
<font color="yellow">I thought you would volunteer to do it.</font>

572
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,170
<font color="yellow">Shut up! Man, you are both cowards.</font>

573
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,530
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

574
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,500
<font color="yellow">I was there when your father died.</font>

575
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,290
<font color="yellow">It was not me who stabbed him.</font>

576
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,200
<font color="yellow">As for the person who really did...</font>

577
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,700
<font color="yellow">the same thing happened to him
and he got stabbed.</font>

578
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,070
<font color="yellow">He passed away five years ago.</font>

579
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,460
<font color="yellow">What do you say?</font>

580
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,620
<font color="yellow">Why don't we call it even with this?</font>

581
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,900
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to end it?</font>

582
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,120
<font color="yellow">Hey! You bastards are all dead.</font>

583
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,810
<font color="yellow">The cops will be here very soon.</font>

584
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:20,110
<font color="yellow">You'd better free these two
before they get here.</font>

585
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,380
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let them go now!</font>

586
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,350
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
Do they look tied up or something?</font>

00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,120
<font color="yellow">Hello, Father.</font>

589
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,340
<font color="yellow">Please pray for us.</font>

590
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,120
<font color="yellow">Father, please pray for my family.</font>

591
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,900
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will contact you soon.</font>

592
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,710
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Goodbye.</font>

593
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,550
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

594
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,590
<font color="yellow">Merry Christmas.</font>

595
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,440
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

596
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,000
<font color="yellow">Would you like a piece of candy?</font>

597
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

598
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,000
<font color="yellow">Have a merry Christmas.</font>

599
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,340
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

600
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,410
<font color="yellow">Why are you following me?</font>

601
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:29,810
<font color="yellow">What? I'm only going my way.
Why do you keep standing in front of me?</font>

602
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:34,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you following me?</font>

603
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,300
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

604
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you should go alone
today, so I was coming with you.</font>

605
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,670
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Why are you following that guy?</font>
