00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,701
<font color="yellow">In our bodies, there are things called lipids.</font>

10
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:46,971
<font color="yellow">They're stored in us to be later used as energy source.</font>

11
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,871
<font color="yellow">Which means, they're essential to keep our bodies...</font>

12
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:52,871
<font color="yellow">alive and moving.</font>

13
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,371
<font color="yellow">But?</font>

14
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:59,601
<font color="yellow">But even the best things in life can be harmful...</font>

15
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,101
<font color="yellow">when you have too much of them.</font>

16
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,201
<font color="yellow">When there are too much lipids to be broken down,</font>

17
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,471
<font color="yellow">they pile up in our brains,</font>

18
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,601
<font color="yellow">making us hard to remember things...</font>

19
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,371
<font color="yellow">and unable to move freely.</font>

20
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,201
<font color="yellow">So it's not because I lack something,</font>

21
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:23,801
<font color="yellow">but rather, I have too much of them?</font>

22
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,101
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

23
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,471
<font color="yellow">Will I not be able to remember anything?</font>

24

<font color="yellow">What are you staring at?</font>

38
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:26,641
<font color="yellow">Everything.</font>

39
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,171
<font color="yellow">- What? - Pretty things.</font>

40
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:33,741
<font color="yellow">Buildings.</font>

00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,271

52
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:17,971
<font color="yellow">Why do you want her?</font>

53
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,841
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to die? - I'm doing this to live.</font>

54

<font color="yellow">I want to save her and myself.</font>

55
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,041
<font color="yellow">Will she die when she's with me?</font>

56
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,371
<font color="yellow">Please leave her alone.</font>

57
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,971
<font color="yellow">I told you to take the inheritance. We don't need it.</font>

58
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,271
<font color="yellow">Your acting has gotten better.</font>

59
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,901
<font color="yellow">Do you think you have the rights?</font>

60
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,141
<font color="yellow">Money will give me the rights, you idiot.</font>

61
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:46,101
<font color="yellow">You're really annoying me.</font>

62
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:48,501
<font color="yellow">How much do you need?</font>

63
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,871
<font color="yellow">I'll come back for her, so have her things packed.</font>

64
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:57,371
<font color="yellow">If you ever show your disgusting face again...</font>

65
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:58,371
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

66
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,871
<font color="yellow">Throw away those junks.</font>

67
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,871
<font color="yellow">I'll buy her new things.</font>

68
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:09,271
<font color="yellow">Sure! You can try. Bring it on!</font>

69
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:11,171
<font color="yellow">Let's see who gets the rights!</font>

70
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,941
<font color="yellow">Regarding rights,</font>

71
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,841
<font color="yellow">there is no way you can win against her.</font>

72
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,571
<font color="yellow">I mean, she calls you dad,</font>

73
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,941
<font color="yellow">but you two are strangers on papers.</font>

74
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,141
<font color="yellow">That's exactly where you come in.</font>

75
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,401
<font color="yellow">I thought you are a legal agent.</font>

76
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,301
<font color="yellow">Does a legal agent legally give things away?</font>

77
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,201
<font color="yellow">Well, that's how the law works.</font>

78
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:36,301
<font color="yellow">Right of inheritance comes before a written will,</font>

79
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:39,141
<font color="yellow">and parental rights win against a good personality.</font>

80
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,001
<font color="yellow">There is no way you can win this fight.</font>

81
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:46,141
<font color="yellow">Why did you look for me, then?</font>

82
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,601
<font color="yellow">I don't need any of this inheritance.</font>

83
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,541
<font color="yellow">Just don't let her touch the kid.</font>

84
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:53,441
<font color="yellow">What's your use if you can't even do that?</font>

85
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:56,701
<font color="yellow">You're nothing more than a counselor.</font>

86
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:59,971
<font color="yellow">Please don't say that.</font>

87
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:02,441
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

88
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:06,641
<font color="yellow">The chances are slim to none,</font>

89
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,671
<font color="yellow">but there is one thing we can do.</font>

90
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,341
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

91
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:14,501
<font color="yellow">We can try to take away Ms. Yoo's parental rights.</font>

92
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,141
<font color="yellow">Do that, then.</font>

93
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,001
<font color="yellow">That's not up to me.</font>

94
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,741
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor has to claim for a loss of parent right.</font>

95
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:25,841
<font color="yellow">However, they won't make a move...</font>

96
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,441
<font color="yellow">without a clear evidence.</font>

97
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:30,241
<font color="yellow">She abandoned her and ran away.</font>

98
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,801
<font color="yellow">What's clearer than that?</font>

99
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,801
<font color="yellow">That's not going to cut it.</font>

100
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,971
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with these laws?</font>

101
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:43,041
<font color="yellow">We need to find something very fatal...</font>

102
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,901
<font color="yellow">that will make her lose her rights.</font>

103
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,541
<font color="yellow">You have a wonderful taste.</font>

104
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,741
<font color="yellow">Is this the best car you have?</font>

105
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:59,001
<font color="yellow">When will the new models come out?</font>

106
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,271
<font color="yellow">This is the latest model.</font>

107
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,871
<font color="yellow">We have a while until we release a new one.</font>

108
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,771
<font color="yellow">- Then... - What can you do for her?</font>

109
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,471
<font color="yellow">You can't live a day without drinking.</font>

110
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:23,141
<font color="yellow">It's not just because of money, is it?</font>

111
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:30,201
<font color="yellow">It's because you remember when she was born, right?</font>

112
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,611
<font color="yellow">It was the happiest year of your life.</font>

113
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:43,871
<font color="yellow">Go, before it's too late.</font>

114
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,241
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

115
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:52,971
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

116
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:55,571
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

117
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,041
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Ma'am.</font>

118
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:30,401
<font color="yellow">Hey, Geum Bi.</font>

119
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:37,301
<font color="yellow">Hey, we need to talk.</font>

120
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,141
<font color="yellow">Look at her.</font>

121
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:02,471
<font color="yellow">Hey, we're going to a TV station in Busan by subway.</font>

122
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,071
<font color="yellow">Where do we transfer?</font>

123
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:08,271
<font color="yellow">Don't be a bore. Tell us.</font>

124
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,871
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty.</font>

125
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,871
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this?</font>

126
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:23,611
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

127
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,271
<font color="yellow">Do you know how kids get cast for TV on the streets?</font>

128
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,741
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about an acting career?</font>

129
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,241
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

130
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:34,371
<font color="yellow">Never mind. It was your clothes, not your looks.</font>

131
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:35,671
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

132
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,671
<font color="yellow">I really want to be an actor.</font>

133
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,111
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

134
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,611
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

135
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,541
<font color="yellow">Eyes.</font>

136
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:47,901
<font color="yellow">Nose.</font>

137
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,241
<font color="yellow">Look at your chin.</font>

138
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:55,001
<font color="yellow">No. It'll take too much effort.</font>

139
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,201
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Is your dad rich?</font>

140
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:00,971
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. You're perfect.</font>

141
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:02,971
<font color="yellow">You'll look good on camera right now.</font>

142
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:07,441
<font color="yellow">Pretty eyes, nose, and chin.</font>

143
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,501
<font color="yellow">You look adorable.</font>

144
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,571
<font color="yellow">I love your freckles.</font>

145
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:15,571
<font color="yellow">She's ugly and mean.</font>

146
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:25,001
<font color="yellow">Who dressed you today?</font>

147
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,801
<font color="yellow">They did an awful job.</font>

148
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,341
<font color="yellow">You look like an old man.</font>

149
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:40,471
<font color="yellow">You come so often. I might start to love you.</font>

150
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:47,271
<font color="yellow">Did you say you knew something about Joo Young?</font>

151
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,941
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

152
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:51,871
<font color="yellow">Are you already old? Spain.</font>

153
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,971
<font color="yellow">Oh, Spain.</font>

154
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:57,971
<font color="yellow">You must be old, too.</font>

155
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:00,671
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

156
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,001
<font color="yellow">Nothing is free.</font>

157
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:04,671
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

158
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,671
<font color="yellow">- I'll owe you one. - Nonsense.</font>

159
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:10,071
<font color="yellow">You can't even do that at a restaurant.</font>

160
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,301
<font color="yellow">Then what? How much do you want?</font>

161
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,841
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you have any money?</font>

162
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:20,201
<font color="yellow">I know a great organ dealer.</font>

163
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,401
<font color="yellow">Do you want his number?</font>

164
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:25,171
<font color="yellow">I'm willing to do anything right now.</font>

165
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,241
<font color="yellow">I'll give you everything I got for everything you know.</font>

166
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,001
<font color="yellow">I have everything you need already.</font>

167
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,271
<font color="yellow">It's an address. Why don't you go over there?</font>

168
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,741
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty. Don't you think so?</font>

169
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:41,041
<font color="yellow">This color will suit you.</font>

170
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,801
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

171
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,401
<font color="yellow">This one looks nice.</font>

172
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,841
<font color="yellow">It's not your color.</font>

173
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:53,001
<font color="yellow">Let's find something else.</font>

174
00:12:58,901 --> 00:12:59,971
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

175
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,871
<font color="yellow">You look so pretty in it.</font>

176
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,801
<font color="yellow">It looks warm, too.</font>

177
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,101
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

178
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,471
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

179
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:35,601
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what you like, so I ordered everything.</font>

180
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:37,501
<font color="yellow">You can have whatever you want.</font>

181
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:49,971
<font color="yellow">There's probably a misunderstanding between us.</font>

182
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,641
<font color="yellow">Do you know what that word means? "Misunderstanding".</font>

183
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,041
<font color="yellow">She said my mom's dead.</font>

184
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:04,171
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

185
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:12,071
<font color="yellow">That's because I've been abroad for a while.</font>

186
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:13,101
<font color="yellow">Young Ji made a mistake.</font>

187
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,641
<font color="yellow">I even mourned for you.</font>

188
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:17,441
<font color="yellow">Because you were dead.</font>

189
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,971
<font color="yellow">What's your number again?</font>

190
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:25,941
<font color="yellow">I'm going to mourn for you next year as well.</font>

191
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,601
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

192
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:48,471
<font color="yellow">If you're going to do it,</font>

193
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,801
<font color="yellow">then you might as well serve the food that I like.</font>

194
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,471
<font color="yellow">I want pig's feet. From the front legs.</font>

195
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,971
<font color="yellow">I want cream spaghetti and spicy seafood tteokbokki.</font>

196
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,241
<font color="yellow">And I also want jamon.</font>

197
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,741
<font color="yellow">Do you know what that is?</font>

198
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:01,101
<font color="yellow">It's Spanish ham.</font>

199
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,201
<font color="yellow">They're served in very thin slices.</font>

200
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,271
<font color="yellow">What else? What else do you want to eat?</font>

201
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,301
<font color="yellow">I'll draw pictures of them and serve you.</font>

202
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:23,141
<font color="yellow">That's a small bill.</font>

203
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,601
<font color="yellow">I'll pay in full.</font>

204
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,301
<font color="yellow">Is there somewhere you want to go?</font>

205
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:33,401
<font color="yellow">I want to go home.</font>

206
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,701
<font color="yellow">It's way too early for that. The sun is still up.</font>

207
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,371
<font color="yellow">Do you have a honey jar waiting for you at home?</font>

208
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,941
<font color="yellow">What honey jar? It's not a bee hive.</font>

209
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,571
<font color="yellow">Aren't you too broke to be luxurious?</font>

210
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,301
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

211
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,841
<font color="yellow">What do you know about living a luxurious life?</font>

212
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:57,401
<font color="yellow">The clothes and jewelry you're wearing look expensive.</font>

213
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:59,171
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

214
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,471
<font color="yellow">Do you have a problem with my fashion?</font>

215
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:04,771
<font color="yellow">At what age did you start dressing like that?</font>

216
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:11,141
<font color="yellow">Now, I know what you're into.</font>

217
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,901
<font color="yellow">You want to dress like me, don't you?</font>

218
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:15,041
<font color="yellow">Then you should become a grown-up.</font>

219
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:18,041
<font color="yellow">What's so good about being a grown-up?</font>

220
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,901
<font color="yellow">Everything. You can do so many things.</font>

221
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:25,071
<font color="yellow">It really is too bad that you're a minor right now.</font>

222
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:28,801
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

223
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,271
<font color="yellow">Who says only grown-ups can dress like this?</font>

224
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:34,141
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

225
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,701
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Thank you.</font>

226
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:39,371
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

227
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:40,541
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

228
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,201
<font color="yellow">Is this too old for you?</font>

229
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:44,371
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

230
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,601
<font color="yellow">Maybe pink is your color.</font>

231
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:50,141
<font color="yellow">Why are your nails so ugly?</font>

232
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:55,471
<font color="yellow">Isn't it pretty?</font>

233
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,141
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty.</font>

234
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,201
<font color="yellow">Can you make it wavy?</font>

235
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,971
<font color="yellow">Let's give her head some more volume.</font>

236
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:05,971
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure about parting it to the side.</font>

237
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:09,371
<font color="yellow">I want it to look like my hair.</font>

238
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:15,771
<font color="yellow">You look pretty.</font>

239
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:22,641
<font color="yellow">You look really pretty.</font>

240
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,141
<font color="yellow">Some makeup can never go wrong.</font>

241
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,571
<font color="yellow">You look pretty.</font>

242
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,341
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

243
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,171
<font color="yellow">Surprise.</font>

244
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:52,871
<font color="yellow">What is this? I look weird.</font>

245
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:55,841
<font color="yellow">Hey. I know you like it.</font>

246
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,311
<font color="yellow">Don't try to hide your feelings.</font>

247
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,141
<font color="yellow">I don't like anything about it.</font>

248
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:01,341
<font color="yellow">I look like a mean brat.</font>

249
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:04,541
<font color="yellow">Exactly. Boys like that.</font>

250
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,101
<font color="yellow">Don't you know the fairy tales?</font>

251
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,771
<font color="yellow">Nothing good comes out of living as a good girl.</font>

252
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:11,141
<font color="yellow">It's better to be evil and have a fun life.</font>

253
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,701
<font color="yellow">Then you can be good and have a fun life, too.</font>

254
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:15,311
<font color="yellow">Hey, that's like...</font>

255
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,671
<font color="yellow">That's like saying a wolf only lives on carrots.</font>

256
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:20,871
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense.</font>

257
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,841
<font color="yellow">The way I see it, you're definitely evil.</font>

258
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:27,941
<font color="yellow">Like me.</font>

259
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,171
<font color="yellow">You look so evil.</font>

260
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:33,071
<font color="yellow">Evil little girl, evil mom.</font>

261
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,401
<font color="yellow">I'm not evil.</font>

262
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,001
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Do you notice the difference?</font>

263
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:42,241
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

264
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,401
<font color="yellow">To where?</font>

265
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,971
<font color="yellow">Anywhere. You're not settling down here, are you?</font>

266
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,741
<font color="yellow">It was fun being a grown-up, wasn't it?</font>

267
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,811
<font color="yellow">Boys can't have fun like we did.</font>

268
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:25,771
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Don't take them off.</font>

269
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,771
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that? You looked so pretty.</font>

270
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,771
<font color="yellow">I don't look pretty.</font>

271
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,941
<font color="yellow">And I can't go home looking like this.</font>

272
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,401
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

273
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,071
<font color="yellow">Do you care about what other people think of you?</font>

274
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,171
<font color="yellow">I need to get changed.</font>

275
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,641
<font color="yellow">Just go inside dressed like that.</font>

276
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,371
<font color="yellow">If I return home like this,</font>

277
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,311
<font color="yellow">they'll know I met you, lady.</font>

278
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:47,471
<font color="yellow">"Lady"?</font>

279
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,101
<font color="yellow">So what if they know?</font>

280
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:54,001
<font color="yellow">Did your dad tell you something about me?</font>

281
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,371
<font color="yellow">Was it that lady who owns the house?</font>

282
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,941
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

283
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,841
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, what happened to you?</font>

284
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,041
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

285
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:26,941
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

286
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:30,101
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're Geum Bi's stylist.</font>

287
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:33,841
<font color="yellow">No wonder she dresses you so poorly.</font>

288
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,101
<font color="yellow">Don't be rude. She's like a sister to me.</font>

289
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:36,901
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

290
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,311
<font color="yellow">Just look at her face. She's no sister.</font>

291
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:42,141
<font color="yellow">She's an old lady out of date.</font>

292
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:46,471
<font color="yellow">You look much older.</font>

293
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,541
<font color="yellow">What? You...</font>

294
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,941
<font color="yellow">You're ugly.</font>

295
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,371
<font color="yellow">Why you little... Come here.</font>

296
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:56,241
<font color="yellow">Don't you touch her.</font>

297
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:58,101
<font color="yellow">I won't hesitate to start a fight with you.</font>

298
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,001
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

299
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:03,541
<font color="yellow">What if I do touch her?</font>

300
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,811
<font color="yellow">What will you do then?</font>

301
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,901
<font color="yellow">Stop being mean to Kang Hee.</font>

302
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,241
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

303
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,071
<font color="yellow">You can't do this to me.</font>

304
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,311
<font color="yellow">That little brat.</font>

305
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:31,541
<font color="yellow">You ruined these expensive clothes.</font>

306
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,471
<font color="yellow">Are you mad at me?</font>

307
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:47,871
<font color="yellow">For meeting that lady?</font>

308
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,541
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

309
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:53,571
<font color="yellow">I won't see her anymore.</font>

310
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:59,241
<font color="yellow">How can you not? She's your mom.</font>

311
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:02,501
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

312
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:08,941
<font color="yellow">Did you want to wear these kinds of clothes?</font>

313
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:11,441
<font color="yellow">I wanted to try for once.</font>

314
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:15,171
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

315
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:18,841
<font color="yellow">Did that lady really look older than me?</font>

316
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:22,371
<font color="yellow">- What? - That's what you said back there.</font>

317
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:24,701
<font color="yellow">You said she looks older than me.</font>

318
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,741
<font color="yellow">You said that just now.</font>

319
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:48,841
<font color="yellow">Do you like putting on makeup?</font>

320
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,071
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

321
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:53,941
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

322
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,201
<font color="yellow">- That tickles. - My goodness.</font>

323
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:03,501
<font color="yellow">Wait, it really tickles.</font>

324
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,701
<font color="yellow">- It really tickles. - If you were going to do this,</font>

325
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:09,201
<font color="yellow">you should've done something classy.</font>

326
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:12,201
<font color="yellow">- Why? It's pretty. - It's not pretty.</font>

327
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:13,871
<font color="yellow">It's really tacky.</font>

328
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,171
<font color="yellow">My face will change...</font>

329
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,441
<font color="yellow">over time, right?</font>

330
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,941
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, should we do your makeup again?</font>

331
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,841
<font color="yellow">Let's make you look classy.</font>

332
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,641
<font color="yellow">Let's do it!</font>

333
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,741
<font color="yellow">It's been so long.</font>

334
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:45,341
<font color="yellow">You two look great together.</font>

335
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:47,941
<font color="yellow">Come often.</font>

336
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:51,201
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

337
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:52,741
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

338
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,271
<font color="yellow">Do you know Yoo Joo Young?</font>

339
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,501
<font color="yellow">- Who? - Yoo Joo Young.</font>

340
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:01,241
<font color="yellow">You worked with her in Spain.</font>

341
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,641
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's not like that.</font>

342
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,101
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

343
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:28,901
<font color="yellow">I'm not a police officer.</font>

344
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,041
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything.</font>

345
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,771
<font color="yellow">I just did it a few times with her.</font>

346
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:34,871
<font color="yellow">Tell me in detail.</font>

347
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:44,201
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

348
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:46,941
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

349
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,841
<font color="yellow">You ran away after getting caught trafficking drugs.</font>

350
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:57,101
<font color="yellow">The police takes reports on weekends.</font>

351
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,871
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and make a report.</font>

352
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,671
<font color="yellow">Will you say you were threatened?</font>

353
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,101
<font color="yellow">"I just carried it. I never did drugs."</font>

354
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:09,671
<font color="yellow">Police officers would never believe that.</font>

355
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:11,701
<font color="yellow">Don't you try your funny tricks on me.</font>

356
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:12,801
<font color="yellow">Is this a rumor?</font>

357
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,501
<font color="yellow">This is my only card.</font>

358
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,141
<font color="yellow">That's too bad.</font>

359
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,101
<font color="yellow">You can come and take her, then.</font>

360
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:43,001
<font color="yellow">That's 3 and 3 over 7.</font>

361
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,571
<font color="yellow">- Then one-third... - You're studying, Geum Bi.</font>

362
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:48,401
<font color="yellow">Did you get off work early?</font>

363
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:50,101
<font color="yellow">Did you cut work?</font>

364
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:51,801
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

365
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:54,041
<font color="yellow">I did something awesome today.</font>

366
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:56,271
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

367
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:59,771
<font color="yellow">You can continue to live here.</font>

368
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:01,541
<font color="yellow">This isn't your house.</font>

369
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,601
<font color="yellow">Exactly. But you can keep living here.</font>

370
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,201
<font color="yellow">I will even if you try to stop me.</font>

371
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:06,941
<font color="yellow">Yes, go ahead.</font>

372
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,541
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

373
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:12,041
<font color="yellow">Why are you two fighting? I should be speaking.</font>

374
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,471
<font color="yellow">If you two continue to bicker, I'll kick you both...</font>

375
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:18,901
<font color="yellow">I think she'll back down.</font>

376
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,571
<font color="yellow">- How? - What's going on?</font>

377
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:26,271
<font color="yellow">It just happened.</font>

378
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:27,701
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

379
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:30,141
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Geum Bi.</font>

380
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:31,701
<font color="yellow">Let's all go out together.</font>

381
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:35,341
<font color="yellow">Really? Yes. Let's all go out.</font>

382
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:38,001
<font color="yellow">Nonsense. All you ever do is play.</font>

383
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:42,301
<font color="yellow">Are you mad?</font>

384
00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:44,371
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the bathroom.</font>

385
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,801
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

386
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:48,641
<font color="yellow">Remember to put the seat cover down.</font>

387
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:49,941
<font color="yellow">You're splashing everywhere.</font>

388
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,871
<font color="yellow">I did not.</font>

389
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,401
<font color="yellow">You should go sitting down from now on.</font>

390
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,601
<font color="yellow">What? That is not happening.</font>

391
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:57,171
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything about men.</font>

392
00:26:57,171 --> 00:26:58,571
<font color="yellow">You take number two sitting down.</font>

393
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:00,401
<font color="yellow">Those are not the same.</font>

394
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:03,001
<font color="yellow">Also, don't splatter toothpaste on the mirror.</font>

395
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,341
<font color="yellow">You're the one who does that. Don't blame me.</font>

396
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:07,471
<font color="yellow">I'm too small to do that.</font>

397
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,571
<font color="yellow">You're disgusting.</font>

398
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,871
<font color="yellow">What an ugly kid.</font>

399
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,241
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

400
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:21,441
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

401
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:24,201
<font color="yellow">This house...</font>

402
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,601
<font color="yellow">used to bustle with people.</font>

403
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:30,501
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the food. - You love meat.</font>

404
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:31,971
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Eat meat, Joon Pil.</font>

405
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:33,071
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

406
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,501
<font color="yellow">- Joon Pil, no. - Kang Hee, have some.</font>

407
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,171
<font color="yellow">No, eat bean sprouts, Kang Hee.</font>

408
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,841
<font color="yellow">- Here, Jun Hee. - She eats so well.</font>

409
00:27:38,841 --> 00:27:40,141
<font color="yellow">You're on a diet. Eat a little.</font>

410
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:42,041
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Look at you.</font>

411
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,901
<font color="yellow">- Give me some, too. - Here.</font>

412
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,641
<font color="yellow">Here. Not.</font>

413
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,441
<font color="yellow">It's for Jun Hee.</font>

414
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:57,671
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Stop bothering me.</font>

415
00:27:57,671 --> 00:28:00,471
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. Go play with Joon Pil.</font>

416
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:15,241
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's a dog.</font>

417
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,001
<font color="yellow">You're adorable.</font>

418
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:32,541
<font color="yellow">Are you alone?</font>

419
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:45,841
<font color="yellow">- Jun Hee! - No!</font>

420
00:28:57,741 --> 00:29:00,141
<font color="yellow">Dad. Have some.</font>

421
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:18,041
<font color="yellow">Joon Pil thinks...</font>

422
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:22,471
<font color="yellow">that I think of Geum Bi like she's Jun Hee.</font>

423
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:28,101
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was like that at first.</font>

424
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,441
<font color="yellow">But now,</font>

425
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,001
<font color="yellow">she's just Geum Bi.</font>

426
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:40,271
<font color="yellow">She's not someone else.</font>

427
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,441
<font color="yellow">She doesn't remind me of anyone.</font>

428
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,801
<font color="yellow">- She's just our Geum Bi. - I know.</font>

429
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,801
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say it.</font>

430
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,801
<font color="yellow">No one can take...</font>

431
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,441
<font color="yellow">our Geum Bi away.</font>

432
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:12,301
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can do this?</font>

433
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:16,271
<font color="yellow">She'll lose her words...</font>

434
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,641
<font color="yellow">and her memory.</font>

435
00:30:20,971 --> 00:30:22,601
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to walk.</font>

436
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,901
<font color="yellow">Could I take care of her...</font>

437
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,771
<font color="yellow">even when those things happen?</font>

438
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,801
<font color="yellow">What if I get tired of her?</font>

439
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:39,071
<font color="yellow">What if I get sick of her?</font>

440
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,571
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

441
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,301
<font color="yellow">She's not even my own child.</font>

442
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:46,741
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid, too.</font>

443
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:50,571
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

444
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:56,141
<font color="yellow">But for now, let's think of this moment.</font>

445
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,241
<font color="yellow">Just this moment.</font>

446
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:23,101
<font color="yellow">I went to the shop.</font>

447
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:28,701
<font color="yellow">Then you must know.</font>

448
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:31,171
<font color="yellow">I haven't been working.</font>

449
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:34,641
<font color="yellow">Will you lend me money?</font>

450
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:36,401
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

451
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:40,901
<font color="yellow">Then I have no business with you.</font>

452
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:45,141
<font color="yellow">I want to be your man.</font>

453
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,741
<font color="yellow">I do not have any intentions...</font>

454
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:48,941
<font color="yellow">of becoming your finance.</font>

455
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,401
<font color="yellow">I have a daughter.</font>

456
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:00,941
<font color="yellow">I have to bring her to get money.</font>

457
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:09,401
<font color="yellow">Good for you. You have a daughter.</font>

458
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:10,401
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

459
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,701
<font color="yellow">She even mourns for me.</font>

460
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:19,201
<font color="yellow">She must be...</font>

461
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:21,601
<font color="yellow">with her dad.</font>

462
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:24,001
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

463
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:25,871
<font color="yellow">I didn't know.</font>

464
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:28,771
<font color="yellow">How did you meet her dad?</font>

465
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,041
<font color="yellow">I dated a few guys...</font>

466
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:34,841
<font color="yellow">when I was young.</font>

467
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,371
<font color="yellow">He's one of them.</font>

468
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,741
<font color="yellow">One of them?</font>

469
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:46,401

00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:46,001
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

628
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:47,501
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

629
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,341
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

630
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:51,301
<font color="yellow">Did you not enjoy that?</font>

631
00:45:52,671 --> 00:45:54,871
<font color="yellow">No. It was boring.</font>

632
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:56,571
<font color="yellow">I was enjoying it.</font>

633
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:01,001
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

634
00:46:08,471 --> 00:46:10,241
<font color="yellow">In the fairy tale...</font>

635
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:16,241
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing without me?</font>

636
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:17,941
<font color="yellow">We were playing Truth or Dare.</font>

637
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:20,641
<font color="yellow">That's such a childish game.</font>

638
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:24,271
<font color="yellow">Let's be childish and make him join us.</font>

639
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:26,401
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

640
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:27,741
<font color="yellow">Come over here.</font>

641
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,901
<font color="yellow">I don't want to join in.</font>

642
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:34,571
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi first.</font>

643
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:39,701
<font color="yellow">Who owned the pink bicycle?</font>

644
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:41,971
<font color="yellow">Don't ask such a thing.</font>

645
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:46,101
<font color="yellow">My younger sister.</font>

646
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,341
<font color="yellow">I'm okay now.</font>

647
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,001
<font color="yellow">Her name was Jun Hee.</font>

648
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:01,371
<font color="yellow">She was sweet and pretty just like you.</font>

649
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:04,771
<font color="yellow">She died when she was seven.</font>

650
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:08,541
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

651
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:13,401
<font color="yellow">I told her I couldn't be bothered to play with her,</font>

652
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,641
<font color="yellow">so she went out into the streets and got hurt.</font>

653
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:20,671
<font color="yellow">My mom and dad...</font>

654
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,841
<font color="yellow">didn't say anything.</font>

655
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:27,571
<font color="yellow">I guess they couldn't forgive me.</font>

656
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:33,371
<font color="yellow">For 20 years after that,</font>

657
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,271
<font color="yellow">no one in this house ever laughed.</font>

658
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:41,871
<font color="yellow">Until you moved in.</font>

659
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:51,441
<font color="yellow">Is it my turn?</font>

660
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:56,201
<font color="yellow">Tell me about your parents.</font>

661
00:47:56,871 --> 00:47:58,001
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

662
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,441
<font color="yellow">My mom died...</font>

663
00:48:09,741 --> 00:48:11,241
<font color="yellow">before I entered middle school.</font>

664
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:15,171
<font color="yellow">It was cancer or something.</font>

665
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:18,941
<font color="yellow">I don't remember.</font>

666
00:48:21,241 --> 00:48:24,141
<font color="yellow">I think she was a really sweet woman.</font>

667
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,141
<font color="yellow">My dad was a police officer.</font>

668
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:31,341
<font color="yellow">While chasing a criminal,</font>

669
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:35,641
<font color="yellow">he just...</font>

670
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:40,171
<font color="yellow">He should've been more careful.</font>

671
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:45,071
<font color="yellow">He talked a lot for a guy.</font>

672
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:51,671
<font color="yellow">He nagged so much.</font>

673
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:55,941
<font color="yellow">I hated listening to him nag.</font>

674
00:48:57,741 --> 00:48:59,201
<font color="yellow">But now,</font>

675
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:03,471
<font color="yellow">I miss the nagging.</font>

676
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,401
<font color="yellow">I should've recorded his voice.</font>

677
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:16,371
<font color="yellow">Now, you tell us.</font>

678
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:19,171
<font color="yellow">- What? - What happened earlier?</font>

679
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:21,901
<font color="yellow">- When? - During the puppet show.</font>

680
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:24,871
<font color="yellow">Why did you run out all of a sudden?</font>

681
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:30,641
<font color="yellow">I felt sorry for it.</font>

682
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:32,741
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

683
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:37,101
<font color="yellow">The puppet.</font>

684
00:49:38,301 --> 00:49:39,971
<font color="yellow">Did you feel sorry for the puppet?</font>

685
00:49:50,341 --> 00:49:52,601
<font color="yellow">Its arms and legs hung limply...</font>

686
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:55,501
<font color="yellow">and it couldn't move on its own.</font>

687
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,241
<font color="yellow">It would be scary if it could.</font>

688
00:49:58,341 --> 00:49:59,841
<font color="yellow">It would be like "Chucky".</font>

689
00:50:01,471 --> 00:50:02,471
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

690
00:50:03,871 --> 00:50:06,271
<font color="yellow">that's what I'd end up like.</font>

691
00:50:16,941 --> 00:50:18,171
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

692
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:21,741
<font color="yellow">It won't happen to you.</font>

693
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:29,641
<font color="yellow">You won't end up like that.</font>

694
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,801
<font color="yellow">Wherever you are,</font>

695
00:50:51,901 --> 00:50:53,341
<font color="yellow">whatever your situation,</font>

696
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,941
<font color="yellow">if you call me, I'll be there in an hour.</font>

697
00:50:57,841 --> 00:50:59,371
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

698
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,301
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

699
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:13,071
<font color="yellow">Did your parents have dimples, too?</font>

700
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:16,541
<font color="yellow">- What? - I have dimples just like you.</font>

701
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:23,301
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

702
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:24,771
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen them in years.</font>

703
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:26,741
<font color="yellow">What kind of a son doesn't know?</font>

704
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:30,601
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee.</font>

705
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:32,471
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

706
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:35,271
<font color="yellow">Can I have the bicycle?</font>

707
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:38,601
<font color="yellow">I'll wipe it every day...</font>

708
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:41,101
<font color="yellow">and take good care of it for a long time.</font>

709
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:51,041
<font color="yellow">You know,</font>

710
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:55,401
<font color="yellow">when I'm no longer able to recognize you...</font>

711
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:57,101
<font color="yellow">Whether it's now or then,</font>

712
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:59,001
<font color="yellow">I'll come whenever you call.</font>

713
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:12,971
<font color="yellow">I can't breathe.</font>

714
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:14,601
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

715
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:15,601
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

716
00:53:00,441 --> 00:53:02,671
<font color="yellow">(Hwi Cheol, Kang Hee, Geum Bi)</font>

717
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:18,441
<font color="yellow">(Hwi Cheol, Kang Hee, Geum Bi)</font>

718
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:59,341
<font color="yellow">The phone is turned off. Please leave a message.</font>

719
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:08,501
<font color="yellow">I told you to answer before the third chime.</font>

720
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:19,071
<font color="yellow">I have it on vibration.</font>

721
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:20,801
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

722
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:24,101
<font color="yellow">I won't kick you.</font>

723
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,771
<font color="yellow">If I break a rib, you'll have to take time off.</font>

724
00:54:32,471 --> 00:54:34,541
<font color="yellow">Can you see your performance rating?</font>

725
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,801
<font color="yellow">You are placed...</font>

726
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:38,141
<font color="yellow">second from the bottom.</font>

727
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:40,241
<font color="yellow">I'm bringing you money regularly.</font>

728
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:42,141
<font color="yellow">Our business is nothing...</font>

729
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:44,701
<font color="yellow">if we don't make 10 times the banks do.</font>

730
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:50,041
<font color="yellow">Who is Mo Hwi Cheol?</font>

731
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,371
<font color="yellow">You chase him around instead of working.</font>

732
00:54:56,801 --> 00:55:00,141
<font color="yellow">I hate idiots with too many secrets.</font>

733
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:04,441
<font color="yellow">I wondered why someone like you wanted to work for me.</font>

734
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:08,141
<font color="yellow">Are you a police informant or something?</font>

735
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:11,041
<font color="yellow">Look into my past, then.</font>

736
00:55:13,301 --> 00:55:16,041
<font color="yellow">Shall I deal with him?</font>

737
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:18,941
<font color="yellow">So you can focus on your work.</font>

738
00:55:20,271 --> 00:55:22,501
<font color="yellow">If you touch him, I'll come for you.</font>

739
00:55:23,141 --> 00:55:24,971
<font color="yellow">You want to do it yourself?</font>

740
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:27,571
<font color="yellow">You remind me of someone I met in prison.</font>

741
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:28,741
<font color="yellow">That's so boring.</font>

742
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:35,441
<font color="yellow">Work harder.</font>

743
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:39,871
<font color="yellow">Break his collarbone before you let him go.</font>

744
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:48,201
<font color="yellow">You said it was on vibrate.</font>

745
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:50,971
<font color="yellow">Joo Young, please.</font>

746
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:53,001
<font color="yellow">Give us some time.</font>

747
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:55,771
<font color="yellow">I'll send her to you like you wanted.</font>

748
00:55:56,171 --> 00:55:58,301
<font color="yellow">Give us more time. Please?</font>

749
00:56:09,071 --> 00:56:12,241
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised. You never call me first.</font>

750
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:23,871
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised.</font>

751
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:26,341
<font color="yellow">You never get beaten up.</font>

752
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:29,971
<font color="yellow">Don't get funny. Just do as you're told.</font>

753
00:56:30,271 --> 00:56:32,101
<font color="yellow">Don't get carried away.</font>

754
00:56:32,571 --> 00:56:34,841
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm following your orders?</font>

755
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:39,101
<font color="yellow">I need my plan to work to ruin Hwi Cheol.</font>

756
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:40,601
<font color="yellow">That's how you'll get back at him.</font>

757
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:42,701
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me?</font>

758
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:45,771
<font color="yellow">I need a loan.</font>

759
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,071
<font color="yellow">I quit work.</font>

760
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:52,271
<font color="yellow">Don't get into something you can't deal with.</font>

761
00:56:52,671 --> 00:56:54,441
<font color="yellow">Don't be so stingy.</font>

762
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,101
<font color="yellow">Once things settle down,</font>

763
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:58,241
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back with interest.</font>

764
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:01,001
<font color="yellow">Did you get something?</font>

765
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,101
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

766
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:06,001
<font color="yellow">It seems you got to Hwi Cheol.</font>

767
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:07,801
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

768
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:11,041
<font color="yellow">You viper. You smell it already?</font>

769
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:31,101
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

770
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:34,841
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

771
00:57:36,171 --> 00:57:37,241
<font color="yellow">No?</font>

772
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:38,871
<font color="yellow">Me, neither.</font>

773
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:41,241
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

774
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:44,771
<font color="yellow">There are too many bad guys.</font>

775
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,671
<font color="yellow">You're a bad guy, too.</font>

776
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:51,041
<font color="yellow">So I'm here to do something bad.</font>

777
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:55,271
<font color="yellow">Do that bad thing somewhere else.</font>

778
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,441
<font color="yellow">I'll do it somewhere else, too.</font>

779
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:04,471
<font color="yellow">When you were in school, did you have...</font>

780
00:58:04,471 --> 00:58:06,241
<font color="yellow">friends other than my dad?</font>

781
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:12,541
<font color="yellow">You didn't, right?</font>

782
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:15,701
<font color="yellow">Is he not at home?</font>

783
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:18,001
<font color="yellow">My dad?</font>

784

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

785
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:21,871
<font color="yellow">Your friend.</font>

786
00:58:22,241 --> 00:58:23,971
<font color="yellow">You mean my dad.</font>

787
00:58:24,741 --> 00:58:25,771
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

788
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:27,641
<font color="yellow">Your friend.</font>

789
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:30,941
<font color="yellow">Stop playing with words.</font>

790
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:33,101
<font color="yellow">No wonder you don't have friends.</font>

791
00:58:34,171 --> 00:58:35,871
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol isn't your dad.</font>

792
00:58:36,801 --> 00:58:39,801
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. Call him whatever you want.</font>

793
00:58:42,241 --> 00:58:43,401
<font color="yellow">Mo Hwi Cheol.</font>

794
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:52,301

<font color="yellow">(My Fair Lady 2016)</font>

796
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:30,541
<font color="yellow">I'm not Yoo Geum Bi. I'm Mo Geum Bi.</font>

797
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,241
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a conscience?</font>

798
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:34,601
<font color="yellow">Don't you know he barely makes a living?</font>

799
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:36,241
<font color="yellow">Why should he put up...</font>

800
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:37,701
<font color="yellow">with a kid that isn't his?</font>

801
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,201
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way.</font>

802
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:43,171
<font color="yellow">I can't let someone like you take Geum Bi.</font>

803
00:59:43,171 --> 00:59:45,271
<font color="yellow">We can't even cancel her parental rights?</font>

804
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:46,501
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

805
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:47,971
<font color="yellow">Considering the way I lived,</font>

806
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:49,771
<font color="yellow">even I wouldn't believe me.</font>

807
00:59:49,771 --> 00:59:51,741
<font color="yellow">You memorized the subway stations.</font>

808
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:52,901
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten them?</font>

809
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:54,241
<font color="yellow">Why would I forget?</font>

810
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:55,541
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's very sick.</font>

811
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,001
<font color="yellow">When her condition worsens,</font>

812
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,141
<font color="yellow">she won't recognize either of us.</font>

813
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:00,471

<font color="yellow">handle her.</font>

815
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:04,571
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to live with me?</font>

816
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:06,301
<font color="yellow">You're pretty.</font>

817
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:09,141
<font color="yellow">My dear daughter.</font>
