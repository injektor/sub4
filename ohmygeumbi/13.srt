15

even if we tried to adopt her</font>

<font color="yellow">Wait. No. No!</font>

21
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,970
<font color="yellow">Why would you throw that out?</font>

22
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,830
<font color="yellow">To be honest,
I have a mild stomachache right now.</font>

23
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,740
<font color="yellow">Then you should've just told me.
This is very expensive.</font>

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,960

I saw it on sale at the market.</font>

35
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,640
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me about it?</font>

36
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,310

too risky to tell you about it at all.</font>

129
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,550
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

130
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,690
<font color="yellow">It's called jamón.</font>

131
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,130

Like a sausage.</font>

132
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,670

you eat in thin slices, right?</font>

so I just bought it as a gift.</font>

136
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,260

137

143
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,400
<font color="yellow">So anyway, I need someone
who knows how to speak Spanish.</font>

144
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,910
<font color="yellow">The job won't be easy.</font>

145
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,400
<font color="yellow">But if you are interested...</font>

146
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,340
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to come with me.</font>

147
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,160
<font color="yellow">12 times...</font>

148
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,070
<font color="yellow">Not bad.</font>

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,860
<font color="yellow">I might not cook often,
but I'm quite amazing at it.</font>

150
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,100
<font color="yellow">- What has gotten into you?
- What do you mean?</font>

151
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,130
<font color="yellow">Can't a mother just
cook and feed her daughter?</font>

152
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,560
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

153
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,840
<font color="yellow">Patzzi's grandma.</font>

154
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,540
<font color="yellow">You two look alike. Even if you
had a rough relationship with her.</font>

155
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,760
<font color="yellow">She and you would've
had a wonderful relationship.</font>

156
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,390
<font color="yellow">See how she left her inheritance
to you and not to me?</font>

157
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,220
<font color="yellow">Maybe she did it so that
you could be my wake up call.</font>

158
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,270
<font color="yellow">Meanness runs in the family.</font>

159
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,820
<font color="yellow">Do you miss your mom?</font>

160
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,770
<font color="yellow">A little bit.</font>

161
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,820
<font color="yellow">A little bit?</font>

162
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,000
<font color="yellow">A lot.</font>

163
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,420
<font color="yellow">A lot?</font>

164
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,450
<font color="yellow">Very much.</font>

165
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:39,420
<font color="yellow">This is why people need to
express their love.</font>

166
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,820
<font color="yellow">If they say things they don't mean
and push others away</font>

167
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,700
<font color="yellow">other people will act out.</font>

168
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,030
<font color="yellow">I know she did what she did for me.</font>

169
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,230
<font color="yellow">You should have listened to your mother.</font>

170
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,240
<font color="yellow">Hey. I can be sure of this.</font>

171
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,580
<font color="yellow">As you grow older,
you probably won't listen to me either.</font>

172
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,670
<font color="yellow">You said it runs in the family.</font>

173
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,150
<font color="yellow">- I hate you so much.
- What are you doing?</font>

174
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,410
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to go to work today.
- What?</font>

175
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,260
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, "What"?</font>

176
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,240
<font color="yellow">Why are we here?</font>

177
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,270
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

178
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,550
<font color="yellow">It's pitiful if an adult
doesn't act like an adult.</font>

179
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,380
<font color="yellow">And it's creepy
if a kid doesn't act like a kid.</font>

180
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,450
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?
It's freaking cold out.</font>

181
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,160
<font color="yellow">What a creepy girl.</font>

182
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,220
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling creepy?
You're the ugly one.</font>

183
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,230
<font color="yellow">- That's enough.
- What do you mean?</font>

184
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,780
<font color="yellow">Stop worrying about me</font>

185
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,060
<font color="yellow">and worry about yourself first.</font>

186
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,010
<font color="yellow">Live in that house starting today.</font>

187
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,960
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

188
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,070
<font color="yellow">Live with your dad.</font>

189
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,170
<font color="yellow">- Dad?
- Yeah.</font>

190
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,430
<font color="yellow">Dad. Your dad.</font>

191
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,740
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

192
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,980
<font color="yellow">- I can live by myself now.
- What's wrong?</font>

193
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,780
<font color="yellow">Are you tired of living with me?</font>

194
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,090
<font color="yellow">I feel like I won't be
able to survive without you</font>

195
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,670
<font color="yellow">but I can.</font>

196
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,160
<font color="yellow">I heard you said...</font>

197
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,160
<font color="yellow">you felt like I'd die before you
if you just let me be.</font>

198
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,470
<font color="yellow">Now I can live without dying.</font>

199
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,760
<font color="yellow">So you can now go back to Dad.</font>

200
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,300
<font color="yellow">- Without me...
- Geum Bi.</font>

201
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,140
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to be
an actual adult this time.</font>

202
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,100
<font color="yellow">To do that, I need to pay my debt back.</font>

203
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,770
<font color="yellow">And I also need a reputable job.</font>

204
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,470
<font color="yellow">That's how things are.</font>

205
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,070
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

206
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,500
<font color="yellow">I... am going to go
somewhere far away.</font>

207
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,230
<font color="yellow">Until I come back</font>

208
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,170
<font color="yellow">live happily with your dad.</font>

209
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,340
<font color="yellow">You get what I'm saying, right?</font>

210
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,420
<font color="yellow">Hold on! Let go of me.</font>

211
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,960
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.</font>

212
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,920
<font color="yellow">Don't you take a step closer to me.</font>

213
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,600
<font color="yellow">Do you never want to see me again?</font>

214
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,540
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

215
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,360
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

216
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,150
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

217
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,710
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

218
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,010
<font color="yellow">Please be in here. Please.</font>

219
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,420
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What am I supposed to do?</font>

220
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,060
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad.</i></font>

221
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,900
<font color="yellow">I'm hearing things now.</font>

222
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,630
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

223
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,410
<font color="yellow">Can't you see? I'm home.</font>

224
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,060
<font color="yellow">What about your mother?</font>

225
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,490
<font color="yellow">She said she's leaving
to become an adult.</font>

226
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,210
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

227
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,840
<font color="yellow">Anyway.</font>

228
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,550
<font color="yellow">It's you. My Geum Bi.</font>

229
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,330
<font color="yellow">Include me in this, all right?</font>

230
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,220
<font color="yellow">Don't exclude me.</font>

231
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:26,244
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by DramaFever</font>

232
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,450
<font color="yellow">So what do you want to do?</font>

233
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,820
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? We need to go to bed.</font>

234
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,100
<font color="yellow">So why does Geum Bi
need to sleep in that room?</font>

235
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,050
<font color="yellow">Then you want her to sleep here?</font>

236
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,680
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, why don't you sleep
with your dad? It's been a while.</font>

237
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,760
<font color="yellow">That's gross.
Why would I sleep with you?</font>

238
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,360
<font color="yellow">Gross? I've done so much for you.
I even put up a tree for you.</font>

239
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,590
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to get pouty.
- Go ahead.</font>

240
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,640
<font color="yellow">Then we can all sleep together.</font>

241
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,630
<font color="yellow">How could all three of us...</font>

242
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,200
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's do this, then.</font>

243
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,050
<font color="yellow">Why would we act like homeless people?</font>

244
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,890
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

245
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,040
<font color="yellow">We even simulated boot camp training.</font>

246
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,570
<font color="yellow">If we had the raining effects,
it'd be perfect.</font>

247
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,180
<font color="yellow">We're camping out, why would it rain?</font>

248
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,460
<font color="yellow">- Is this tent waterproof?
- It should be.</font>

249
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,320
<font color="yellow">It's truly waterproof if it doesn't
let any water out once it pours in.</font>

250
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,740
<font color="yellow">- We need to spill ramen.
- And barf after eating pork cutlet.</font>

251
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,400
<font color="yellow">- You made me eat it.
- Be honest.</font>

252
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,150
<font color="yellow">You secretly ate something
without me, didn't you?</font>

253
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,390
<font color="yellow">No. That's not true.
I starved all day that day.</font>

254
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,620
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
- I can't believe you.</font>

255
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,120
<font color="yellow">I can't understand a thing.
Try to make some sense.</font>

256
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,310
<font color="yellow">- What are we going to do tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?</font>

257
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,670
<font color="yellow">Let's think about that
when tomorrow comes.</font>

258
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,090
<font color="yellow">- You never plan things ahead of time.
- I know, right?</font>

259
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,340
<font color="yellow">- You always have no plan.
- That's not true.</font>

260
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,950
<font color="yellow">I've been living by a plan for years.</font>

261
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,430
<font color="yellow">I'm a planning man.</font>

262
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,100
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you the opposite of that?
- You're right.</font>

263
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,020
<font color="yellow">- He's the opposite of that.
- Unplanned.</font>

264
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,270
<font color="yellow">You ugly people. Don't even talk.</font>

265
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,500
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stop by there.</font>

266
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,930
<font color="yellow">You should stay by our side
if at all possible.</font>

267
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,560
<font color="yellow">I need to buy gifts for my friends
since we're going on a break.</font>

268
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,750
<font color="yellow">- I'll come with you.
- Why are you treating me like a fool?</font>

269
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,770
<font color="yellow">- Are you worried that I'll get lost?
- It's not that.</font>

270
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,910
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi. Are you sure
you can go by yourself?</font>

271
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,290
<font color="yellow">Your dad and I will be
waiting for you at that cafe.</font>

272
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,010
<font color="yellow">Make sure you call us
if anything happens. Okay?</font>

273
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,300
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

274
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,210
<font color="yellow">It's still...</font>

275
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,870
<font color="yellow">Hwi Chul. I have something to tell you.</font>

276
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,140
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

277
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,190
<font color="yellow">In this state, Geum Bi legally
doesn't have any family or relatives.</font>

278
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,360
<font color="yellow">- You need to adopt her officially.
- Yeah.</font>

279
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,050
<font color="yellow">I could do it. Adoption.</font>

280
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,830
<font color="yellow">I guess she's Mo Geum Bi
from now on. Not Yoo Geum Bi.</font>

281
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,270
<font color="yellow">I'm at a loss for words.</font>

282
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,100
<font color="yellow">Do you not like Mo Geum Bi?</font>

283
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,230
<font color="yellow">Then shall we call her Go Geum Bi?</font>

284
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,850
<font color="yellow">Do you think they'd just
let anyone adopt her?</font>

285
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,880
<font color="yellow">I'm not just anyone.
I'm Geum Bi's father.</font>

286
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,740
<font color="yellow">There are adoption laws.</font>

287
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,970
<font color="yellow">You need to have a certain
amount of assets to adopt someone.</font>

288
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,630
<font color="yellow">You can't have a criminal
or substance abuse record.</font>

289
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,280
<font color="yellow">They check to see if you're qualified.</font>

290
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,390
<font color="yellow">Why would they be so picky?</font>

291
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,810
<font color="yellow">If a father and his daughter connect,
then they should live together.</font>

292
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,250
<font color="yellow">That's not all. It'll take numerous
qualification tests and steps.</font>

293
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,050
<font color="yellow">Also, it's even more difficult
for people who are single.</font>

294
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,240
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many documents?</font>

295
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,180
<font color="yellow">An application for adoption.</font>

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,480

adopt someone when you're single.</font>

301
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,260

304
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,010

Why would I propose to you?</font>

00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,490

give her some sort of penalty.</font>

329
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,750

330
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,280

<font color="yellow">- Geum Bi.
- What's wrong, Geum Bi?</font>

350
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,310
<font color="yellow">She has Niemann-Pick disease.</font>

351
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,930
<font color="yellow">- Niemann-Pick?
- Yes.</font>

352
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,790
<font color="yellow">Since she's having seizures,
give her anti-epileptics.</font>

353
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,580
<font color="yellow">- And keep checking her vitals.
- Okay. Got it.</font>

354
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,240
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

355
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,190
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Geum Bi! Geum Bi!</font>

356
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,120
<font color="yellow">- Are you her guardian?
- What's going on?</font>

357
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,050
<font color="yellow">- You need to stay back.
- Geum Bi!</font>

358
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,210
<font color="yellow">We've stabilized her by giving her
anti-epileptics. So she should be okay.</font>

359
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,050
<font color="yellow">Then can she go home?</font>

360
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,160
<font color="yellow">She has symptoms of pneumonia.</font>

361
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,330
<font color="yellow">It'd be best to have her stay here
so that we can monitor her closely.</font>

362
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,510
<font color="yellow">Pneumonia?</font>

363
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,520
<font color="yellow">I thought she was just having a seizure.</font>

364
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,400
<font color="yellow">Her immune system
has been greatly weakened.</font>

365
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,290
<font color="yellow">Comorbidities complicate this illness.
You need to be aware of it.</font>

366
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:12,750
<font color="yellow">Will this keep happening from now on?</font>

367
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,950
<font color="yellow">I believe her symptoms
will worsen from now on.</font>

368
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,180
<font color="yellow">Her brain functioning level
will especially decline.</font>

369
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:30,330
<font color="yellow">What is going on in Geum Bi's head?</font>

370
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,670
<font color="yellow">See, this is a picture of
a normal person's cerebrum.</font>

371
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,280
<font color="yellow">In a human brain, there are
nerve cells called neurons.</font>

372
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,250
<font color="yellow">Neurons connect at the synapse</font>

373
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,840
<font color="yellow">and memories are created at the synapse.</font>

374
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,780
<font color="yellow">Created memories are then
stored in the hippocampus.</font>

375
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,870
<font color="yellow">In Geum Bi's case, her hippocampus
and cerebrum are shrinking.</font>

376
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,750
<font color="yellow">This is a current scan of Geum Bi's
brain in comparison to a normal brain.</font>

377
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,080
<font color="yellow">How quickly does the disease progress?</font>

378
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,940
<font color="yellow">It differs based on the patient.</font>

379
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,480
<font color="yellow">Since it developed during her childhood</font>

380
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,780
<font color="yellow">she may live for about 10 more years.</font>

381
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,170
<font color="yellow">10 years?</font>

382
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,360
<font color="yellow">Only if her medications work very well.</font>

383
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,330
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

384
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,960
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's illness is progressing
faster than I had predicted.</font>

385
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,290
<font color="yellow">You need to emotionally prepare yourself
so that you don't fall apart.</font>

386
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,390
<font color="yellow">Her seizures will get worse.
It'll be hard for you to bear.</font>

387
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,140
<font color="yellow">As her awareness decreases</font>

388
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,680
<font color="yellow">she'll have difficulty
forming words in two years.</font>

389
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,480
<font color="yellow">Lastly, she'll lose her five senses.</font>

390
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,570
<font color="yellow">She may even show
symptoms of a split personality.</font>

391
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,640
<font color="yellow">That's enough. Enough.</font>

393
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,180
<font color="yellow">You can't just stand here like this.</font>

394
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,360
<font color="yellow">Get a hold of yourself.</font>

395
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,830
<font color="yellow">All right. I need to.</font>

396
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,920
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?</font>

397
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,770
<font color="yellow">You knew what was coming.
We knew what was coming!</font>

398
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,740
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

399
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,760
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully, Hwi Chul.</font>

400
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,440
<font color="yellow">Get a hold of yourself
and listen to me carefully.</font>

401
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,370
<font color="yellow">From now on, we're going
to see and experience</font>

402
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,630
<font color="yellow">the things we've been
reading and hearing about.</font>

403
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,480
<font color="yellow">You told me it was
going to be unbearable.</font>

404
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,690
<font color="yellow">So then what did I tell you?</font>

405
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,650
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you?</font>

406
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,360

because you have someone to..."</font>

408
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,420
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

409
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,580

410
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,280

about coming with me.</font>

445

cup ramen once a day.</font>

446
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,860
<font color="yellow">Fine. Whatever. I can't even bring you
pork cutlet anymore since I'm on a break.</font>

447
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,000
<font color="yellow">- Why is your back so dirty?
- What do you mean?</font>

448
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,670
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

449
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,480
<font color="yellow">Clean it off for me.</font>

450
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,800
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

451
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,520

Hurry and get going.</font>

452
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,980
<font color="yellow">You're so shameless. So shameless.</font>

453
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:29,380
<font color="yellow">- Are you cold, Dad?
- No. Not at all.</font>

454
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,370
<font color="yellow">- It's well-heated in here.
- Then why is your body shaking?</font>

455
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:39,100
<font color="yellow">That's because you're tickling my back.</font>

456
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,810
<font color="yellow">I am?</font>

457
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,220
<font color="yellow">You give me a piggyback ride
when you're older.</font>

458
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,050
<font color="yellow">You'll then understand.</font>

459
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,850
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to. Because you're heavy.
- You're so shameless. Shameless.</font>

460
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,940
<font color="yellow">Leave! I told you to go!
Why do you keep bothering me?</font>

461
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,290
<font color="yellow">Where would I go?
I need to take care of you.</font>

462
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,170

470
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:15,330
<font color="yellow">I was supposed to meet with her today.</font>

471
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,380
<font color="yellow">- Were you waiting for her?
- Yeah.</font>

472
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,420
<font color="yellow">I waited by the school until sunset.</font>

473
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,770
<font color="yellow">Because I knew she wasn't
the type to break her promise.</font>

places with Geum Bi.</font>

felt too, right? When I was sick.</font>

- What do you mean?</font>

and warm egg inside of my heart.</font>

00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:10,460
<font color="yellow">I can't describe it in words.
But there's this thing.</font>

482
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,210
<font color="yellow">I think I somewhat get it.</font>

483
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:19,130
<font color="yellow">- You should carry one, too.
- Maybe.</font>

484
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,670
<font color="yellow">Once I feel like I've earned it.</font>

- Take it to her for me.</font>

Dr. Huh Byung Soo.</font>

496
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,490
<font color="yellow">Look at this guy. You just can't.</font>

497
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,390
<font color="yellow">You've probably looked into
everything for your sick child.</font>

498
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:41,410
<font color="yellow">The medications she's taking
can't cure Niemann-Pick disease.</font>

499
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:46,360
<font color="yellow">Because of the blood-brain barrier,
her medications can't reach her brain.</font>

500
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,360
<font color="yellow">When you say the blood-brain barrier...</font>

501
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,190
<font color="yellow">He's talking about the specialized
structure between the brain and vessels.</font>

502
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:56,550
<font color="yellow">Because of it, her medications
have a minimal effect on her brain.</font>

503
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,300
<font color="yellow">No need to elaborate.
Only we'd understand these concepts.</font>

504
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,810
<font color="yellow">To tell you the main point,
she needs to keep taking her medications</font>

505
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,540
<font color="yellow">while we treat her brain separately.</font>

506
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,400
<font color="yellow">- Through a genetic neurology treatment?
- That's right.</font>

507
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,380
<font color="yellow">You seem to be well aware of it.</font>

508
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,370
<font color="yellow">In patients with Niemann-Pick disease</font>

509
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:20,730
<font color="yellow">inflammation is severe at the memory
associated region, the cerebral cortex</font>

510
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,470
<font color="yellow">and the movement
associated region, the cerebellum.</font>

511
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:26,830
<font color="yellow">So, if we can save those neurons
through a genetic treatment</font>

512
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,690
<font color="yellow">I'm saying we could
treat the regions of the brain</font>

513
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,190
<font color="yellow">that can't be treated
through her medications.</font>

514
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,870
<font color="yellow">Do you think that'd be possible?</font>

515
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,600
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because
I think it'd be possible.</font>

516
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,110
<font color="yellow">Even if it does work</font>

517
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:44,430
<font color="yellow">it may take 10 or 20 years
until it actually reaches the clinic.</font>

518
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,950
<font color="yellow">If it does work, who cares
about the time frame?</font>

519
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,660
<font color="yellow">Is there no way to shorten that time?</font>

520
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,270
<font color="yellow">In order to do so,
he'd need to test it on humans.</font>

521
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,700
<font color="yellow">It'd be too dangerous.</font>

522
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,270
<font color="yellow">Also, this person here...</font>

523
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,320
<font color="yellow">made a mistake during
his past clinical trials.</font>

524
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,920
<font color="yellow">A patient died.</font>

525
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,050
<font color="yellow">I can't forgive him.</font>

526
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,510
<font color="yellow">Dr. Park Woo Hyun.</font>

527
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,580
<font color="yellow">You may say that now</font>

528
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,150
<font color="yellow">but it seems like you're
very interested in this research.</font>

529
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,830
<font color="yellow">What do you think?
Would you like to join my research team?</font>

530
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:32,270
<font color="yellow">I think I could shorten the time frame
by five years if you work with me.</font>

531
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:36,900
<font color="yellow">If we could reduce it by five years</font>

532
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,080
<font color="yellow">I could create a treatment
in just five years.</font>

533
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,640
