so you could act this way?</font>

<font color="yellow">Geum Bi stepped up to try to save you.</font>

12
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,460
<font color="yellow">She felt like you would die before her
if she left things the way they were.</font>

13
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,100
<font color="yellow">She couldn't stand by and watch.</font>

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
<font color="yellow">What's the point of
saving someone like me?</font>

15
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,870
<font color="yellow">Because you want to change!</font>

16
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,780
<font color="yellow">You want to be different.</font>

17
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,290

18
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,590

20
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,910
<font color="yellow">It was all my fault.</font>

21
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,730
<font color="yellow">You don't need to change.</font>

22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,990
<font color="yellow">You just need to go back
to the way you used to be.</font>

23
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,230
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

24
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,410
<font color="yellow">When you got pregnant with Geum Bi,
you came to look for me, right?</font>

25
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,250
<font color="yellow">I pretended not to know.</font>

26
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,830
<font color="yellow">I knew you were there, looking at me.</font>

27
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,970
<font color="yellow">But I laughed it up with other girls
and I pretended not to know.</font>

28
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,270
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

29
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,120
<font color="yellow">Still, you had Geum Bi.</font>

30
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,030
<font color="yellow">You knew how hard it would be,
yet you still gave birth to her.</font>

31
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
<font color="yellow">You're that kind of woman.</font>

32
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,190
<font color="yellow">Yeah, if I had embraced you back then</font>

33
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,090
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi would've
grown up well by my side.</font>

34
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,260
<font color="yellow">It wasn't you.</font>

35
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,350
<font color="yellow">It was me who nearly killed Geum Bi.</font>

36
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,600
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything wrong.</font>

37
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,610
<font color="yellow">So return to Geum Bi now.</font>

38
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,590
<font color="yellow">If you disappear again like this...</font>

39
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,300
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi would be so pitiful.</font>

40
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,010
<font color="yellow">What's with you?</font>

41
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,340
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have a drop of your blood.</font>

42
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,340
<font color="yellow">You're not her dad or anything.</font>

43
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,620
<font color="yellow">So why have you put
your life on the line for her?</font>

44
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,420
<font color="yellow">Even while we're here like this...</font>

45
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,180
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi is running out of time.</font>

46
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,730
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi...</font>

47
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,060
<font color="yellow">She's using up pieces of her
precious time to find you.</font>

48
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,860
<font color="yellow">I can't go.</font>

49
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,890
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi won't even see me as her mom...</font>

50
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,090
<font color="yellow">She won't even see me as a human being.</font>

51
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,930
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi doesn't know anything.</font>

52
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,190
<font color="yellow">Chi Soo stopped
those men from telling her.</font>

53
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,810
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep following me?</font>

54
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,390
<font color="yellow">Your mom owes me something.</font>

55
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,650
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

56
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,030
<font color="yellow">She ran off and I can't find her.</font>

57
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,970
<font color="yellow">Of course you can't find her.
That's her specialty.</font>

58
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,080
<font color="yellow">She showed up this time after nine years.</font>

59
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,730
<font color="yellow">Next time, I don't know
how long she'll take.</font>

60
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

61
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,460
<font color="yellow">Wherever.</font>

62
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,450
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live here then?</font>

63
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,880
<font color="yellow">Do you have money?</font>

64
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,920
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

65
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,150
<font color="yellow">What will you do then?</font>

66
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,710
<font color="yellow">You said my mom owes you money.</font>

67
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,500
<font color="yellow">- So?
- You can add this to that.</font>

68
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,730
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

69
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,820
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating?
You're probably hungry.</font>

70
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,020
<font color="yellow">Put Geum Bi on the phone.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[MO HWI CHUL]</i></font>

72
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,890
<font color="yellow">She doesn't want to talk.
What about Joo Young?</font>

73
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,710
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

74
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,900
<font color="yellow">Tell him I'll be there soon.</font>

75
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,780
<font color="yellow">She'll be home soon.</font>

76
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,300
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi is okay, isn't she?</font>

77
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,450
<font color="yellow">Just worry about yourself.
I'll going to end you...</font>

78
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,790
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about
hiding behind a child.</font>

79
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,980
<font color="yellow">It won't work.</font>

80
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,410
<font color="yellow">Your mom will be coming.</font>

81
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,250
<font color="yellow">- How did you know?
- Know what?</font>

82
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,900
<font color="yellow">You knew that my mom
was alive and my dad...</font>

83
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,870
<font color="yellow">You knew he wasn't my dad.</font>

84
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,230
<font color="yellow">You can find out if you investigate.</font>

85
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,870
<font color="yellow">Then do you know who my real father is?</font>

86
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,850
<font color="yellow">You can ask your mom that stuff.</font>

87
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,260
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm sure you thought she was mine.</font>

88
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,140
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bring myself
to get an abortion.</font>

89
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,690
<font color="yellow">It was the baby of someone I liked.</font>

90
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,180
<font color="yellow">I figured I could handle it
once I had the baby.</font>

91
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,160
<font color="yellow">I wasn't fit to take care a baby.</font>

92
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,930
<font color="yellow">Making a living was a secondary concern.</font>

93
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,950
<font color="yellow">Whenever the baby would cry</font>

94
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,950
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was going insane
and I couldn't deal with it.</font>

95
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,990
<font color="yellow">I lost my mind a few times.</font>

96
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,290
<font color="yellow">I cut my wrists.</font>

97
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,050
<font color="yellow">I started to think I might
really kill the baby.</font>

98
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,490
<font color="yellow">So, I left Geum Bi with Young Ji.</font>

99
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,560
<font color="yellow">I asked for a ticket to
any flight going far away.</font>

100
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,630
<font color="yellow">By the way, who is it?</font>

101
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,210
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's real dad.</font>

102
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,710
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly asking that?</font>

103
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,520
<font color="yellow">I was just curious. That's all.</font>

104
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,240
<font color="yellow">What's the point?</font>

105
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,010
<font color="yellow">Yeah, why is that important?</font>

106
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,500
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi is my daughter.</font>

107
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,640
<font color="yellow">You've changed a little.</font>

108
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,090
<font color="yellow">I don't really know why,
but I can't live like I did before.</font>

109
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,080
<font color="yellow">You should go home.</font>

110
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,090
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

111
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,910
<font color="yellow">She seems like a good woman.</font>

112
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,870
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

113
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,200
<font color="yellow">Don't pretend you don't know, punk.</font>

114
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,820
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that rotten woman.</font>

115
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,850
<font color="yellow">You still have 10,000 years to go
before you become a real human being.</font>

116
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,130
<font color="yellow">Do you really not know?</font>

117
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

118
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,910
<font color="yellow">What I asked you earlier.</font>

119

going to come out of your eyes?</font>

122
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,170

123
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,190

- Why are you changing the subject?</font>

124
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,790

125
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,390

Aren't you going home?</font>

<font color="yellow">What a pain. Why didn't you eat earlier?</font>

130
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,480
<font color="yellow">- Be quiet.
- I already ate.</font>

131
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,520
<font color="yellow">Just eat again.</font>

132
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,280

Why wouldn't you be?</font>

doing that to Hwi Chul?</font>

157
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,780
<font color="yellow">You're going to instigate him to avenge
his dad's murder and end his own life?</font>

158
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,820
<font color="yellow">You have no idea how
scary Jong Won is, do you?</font>

159

you won't be safe either.</font>

160

161
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,530
<font color="yellow">He's been living in the pits
as an orphan his whole life.</font>

162
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,840
<font color="yellow">He's just barely starting
to form a life for himself.</font>

163
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,470
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm ending him now.</font>

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

165
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,760

so how can he live a normal life?</font>

166

<font color="yellow">You harassed him endlessly for years.</font>

167
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,810
<font color="yellow">Why does that matter?</font>

168
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,900
<font color="yellow">He hasn't paid for it.</font>

169
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,110
<font color="yellow">You crazy bastard!</font>

170
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,290

unless you want to be crushed too.</font>

171
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,680
<font color="yellow">Don't do it. Don't.</font>

172
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,550

and don't do anything.</font>

181
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,740

186

Why did you bring me?</font>

302
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,160
<font color="yellow">My mom and dad could be
around here somewhere.</font>

303
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,800
<font color="yellow">If they happen to be here...</font>

304
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,180
<font color="yellow">If they are here?</font>

305
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,700
<font color="yellow">I brought a good person with me,
so I wanted them to see her.</font>

306
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,760
<font color="yellow">Did I do something useless
without even asking you first?</font>

307
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,850
<font color="yellow">If Joon Hui were sick
like Geum Bi, my father...</font>

308
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,110
<font color="yellow">he would never have given up.</font>

309
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,250
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to
give up on Geum Bi either.</font>

310
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,260
<font color="yellow">You feel the same, right?</font>

311
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,470
<font color="yellow">It will be so hard, you'll want to die.</font>

312
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,170
<font color="yellow">I have someone to go through that with.</font>

313
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,250
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask to see me?</font>

314
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,300
<font color="yellow">You said I wouldn't be able to handle it.</font>

315
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,810
<font color="yellow">I did and I still feel that way.</font>

316
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,960
<font color="yellow">Then what is different?</font>

317
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,880
<font color="yellow">I can't be certain that I will be able to
endure it when things get extreme.</font>

318
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,820
<font color="yellow">Still, I know what Geum Bi's illness is.</font>

319
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,720
<font color="yellow">I know what Geum Bi's end will be like.</font>

320
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,160
<font color="yellow">I've reflected on it repeatedly
and prepared myself.</font>

321
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
<font color="yellow">You haven't.</font>

322
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,970
<font color="yellow">What do I have to do?</font>

323
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,160
<font color="yellow">What do I have to do from now on?</font>

324
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,450
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

325
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,080
<font color="yellow">I don't want to fight
and pull out your hair.</font>

326
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,710
<font color="yellow">I'm asking because
I don't know where to start.</font>

327
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,770
<font color="yellow">First, I suppose you
need to know the facts.</font>

328
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,870
<font color="yellow">Still, there must be a treatment.</font>

329
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,250
<font color="yellow">There is none.</font>

330
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,520
<font color="yellow">How can a doctor say that?</font>

331
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,930
<font color="yellow">How can there not be, in this world?</font>

332
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,730
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there's one if you look.</font>

333
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,570
<font color="yellow">Medicine. There are medications.
Geum Bi's been taking them.</font>

334
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,820
<font color="yellow">They are only delaying the symptoms.</font>

335
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,320
<font color="yellow">It is not a cure.</font>

336
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,240
<font color="yellow">Then what about surgery?</font>

337
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,750
<font color="yellow">She can get surgery.</font>

338
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,820
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

339
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,850
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
She's going to die.</font>

340
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,820
<font color="yellow">Did you come this far
without realizing that?</font>

341
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,470
<font color="yellow">Should I just watch it happen
with my eyes open?</font>

342
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,170
<font color="yellow">Did you try another hospital?
It could be an error.</font>

343
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,990
<font color="yellow">What about going abroad?
If she goes abroad...</font>

344
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,910
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be like this
in front of her?</font>

345
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,890
<font color="yellow">Are you going to cry and
whine in front of Geum Bi, too?</font>

346
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,030
<font color="yellow">If you can't handle it,
don't even start.</font>

347
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,100
<font color="yellow">Right now, it would be best to let her
feel at ease and give her stability.</font>

348
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,210
<font color="yellow">I heard there is a clinical trial.</font>

349
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,130
<font color="yellow">I also heard there could be
a treatment within 10 years.</font>

350
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,680
<font color="yellow">What is that about?</font>

351
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,260
<font color="yellow">The effectiveness of it
hasn't been proven.</font>

352
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,150
<font color="yellow">There could be adverse side effects,
and the costs are very high.</font>

353
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,700
<font color="yellow">Who told you to worry about money?</font>

354
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,450
<font color="yellow">I'll give you what you need.
Just fix her.</font>

355
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,370
<font color="yellow">The treatment method is only
a chance, and it's hypothetical.</font>

356
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,460
<font color="yellow">I hope they succeed more than anyone.</font>

357
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,930
<font color="yellow">But I cannot tell you something
you want to hear because I wish to.</font>

358
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,160
<font color="yellow">Stop saying it can't be done!</font>

359
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,480
<font color="yellow">You should be trying to make her better.
You're a doctor!</font>

360
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,320
<font color="yellow">Calm down and listen.</font>

361
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,130
<font color="yellow">But we can try the
clinical trials, right?</font>

362
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,300
<font color="yellow">What is taking so long?</font>

363
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,340
<font color="yellow">It's not even real estate. It's cash.</font>

364
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,390
<font color="yellow">The money in the bank won't go anywhere.</font>

365
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,160
<font color="yellow">All of the inheritance is now yours,
Yoo Joo Young.</font>

366
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,220
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you're in such a rush.</font>

367
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,510
<font color="yellow">How can I not be?
A child's life is on the line.</font>

368
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,680
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

369
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,410
<font color="yellow">Are you, perhaps,
trying to keep that money from me?</font>

370
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,450
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

371
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

372
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,920
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I am not satisfied
with the inheritance going to you.</font>

373
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,370
<font color="yellow">I knew there was no chance.</font>

374
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,230
<font color="yellow">Regarding the issue of custody</font>

375
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,090
<font color="yellow">I wanted Geum Bi
to live with Mo Hwi Chul.</font>

376
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,660
<font color="yellow">I just cannot trust you.</font>

377
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,720
<font color="yellow">I am Geum Bi's mom.</font>

378
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,310
<font color="yellow">I would never harm her.</font>

379
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,700
<font color="yellow">Can I really trust you with her?</font>

380
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,100
<font color="yellow">Who are you to determine
whether I'm trustworthy or not?</font>

381
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,660
<font color="yellow">Just give me the money!</font>

382
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,600
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it soon.</font>

383
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,110
<font color="yellow">Did Geum Bi take that?</font>

384
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

385
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,960
<font color="yellow">It was inside the tent.</font>

386
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,640
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

387
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,700
<font color="yellow">You have her hanging around the place
you ran off to when you were homeless.</font>

388
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,670
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see it?</font>

389
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,750
<font color="yellow">"Mo Geum Bi."</font>

390
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,860
<font color="yellow">It feels completely different because
she changed that one character.</font>

391
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,020
<font color="yellow">What do you think Geum Bi was thinking
when she changed her surname?</font>

392
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,340
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

393
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,490
<font color="yellow">Through life or death,
Hwi Chul is her dad.</font>

394
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,210
<font color="yellow">That's probably what she was thinking.</font>

395
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,070
<font color="yellow">That makes me feel good.</font>

396
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,840
<font color="yellow">When I was looking at that,
it made me think to myself...</font>

397
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,950
<font color="yellow">If I were Geum Bi,
I would wonder who my real dad was.</font>

398
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,910
<font color="yellow">I would've wondered that, at least once.</font>

399
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,770
<font color="yellow">Even if she doesn't say it,
Geum Bi is probably curious.</font>

400
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,160
<font color="yellow">Some things are better left unknown.</font>

401
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,320
<font color="yellow">I think it would be good to show Geum Bi
her father's face before it's too late.</font>

402
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,280
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep bringing up
this useless topic?</font>

403
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,030
<font color="yellow">What's the point of bringing that up now?</font>

404
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,780
<font color="yellow">Don't raise your voice.</font>

405
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,870
<font color="yellow">Just help me find what Geum Bi wants.</font>

406
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,110
<font color="yellow">We should do something.</font>

407
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,940
<font color="yellow">How do you know
that's what Geum Bi wants?</font>

408
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,180
<font color="yellow">Then who is Patzzi's dad?</font>

409
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,810
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.
Is there anything you remember?</font>

410
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,250
<font color="yellow">Anything you can recall.</font>

411
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,570

416
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,520
<font color="yellow">I asked the lady.</font>

417
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,160
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

418
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
<font color="yellow">I had some questions to ask you.</font>

419
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,050
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

420
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,330
<font color="yellow">Are you close to my mom?</font>

421
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,690
<font color="yellow">Why would I be close to her?</font>

422
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,210
<font color="yellow">She's a mean, awful person.</font>

423
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,050
<font color="yellow">Then why are you always meeting her?</font>

424
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,980
<font color="yellow">When have I "always" met her?</font>

425
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,310
<font color="yellow">I just meet her when
I have business to discuss.</font>

426
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,600
<font color="yellow">You must have a lot of business with her.</font>

427
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,560
<font color="yellow">What do you want to know?</font>

428
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,130
<font color="yellow">How did you meet her 10 years ago?</font>

429
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,620
<font color="yellow">What nonsense are you...</font>

430

<font color="yellow">You're not possibly thinking...</font>

431
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,470
<font color="yellow">Run, Geum Bi!</font>

432
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,780
<font color="yellow">Hurry!</font>

433
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,510
<font color="yellow">You're stabbing me
in the back. Is that it?</font>

434
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,060
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

435
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,390
<font color="yellow">She was with him so we brought her, Boss.</font>

436
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,740
<font color="yellow">You... who are you?</font>

437
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,300
<font color="yellow">Don't tell him.</font>

438
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,830
<font color="yellow">Stop that!</font>

439
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,730
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

442
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,360
<font color="yellow">No. Shil La spelled differently.</font>

443
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,500
<font color="yellow">Hong Shil La.</font>

444
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,670
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see. Hong Shil La.</font>

445
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,200
<font color="yellow">Is she your daughter?</font>

446
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,810
<font color="yellow">Is my surname Hong?</font>

447
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,720
<font color="yellow">Then what's your
relationship to this kid?</font>

<font color="yellow">What? You little brat.</font>

450
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,390
<font color="yellow">We're your elders. Is that how
your father taught you to speak?</font>

451
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,080
<font color="yellow">You ugly thing.</font>

452
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,040
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is just...</font>

453
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,870
<font color="yellow"><i>It was when things were
really bad between us.</i></font>

454
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,690
<font color="yellow"><i>I had something for
one night with a guy.</i></font>

455
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,930
<font color="yellow"><i>He was shy and couldn't drink well.</i></font>

456
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,310
<font color="yellow"><i>He was different than the guys
I usually saw, so I was drawn to him.</i></font>

457
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,060
<font color="yellow"><i>He had a unique name,
so I still remember it.</i></font>

458
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,810
<font color="yellow"><i>I remember the school he went to.</i></font>

459
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,880
<font color="yellow">What? Oh, you're not him.</font>

460
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,330
<font color="yellow">Then do you happen to know the contact
info of the person who used this number?</font>

461
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,430
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

462
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,200
<font color="yellow">I was in the middle of talking.</font>

463
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,080
<font color="yellow">You probably wouldn't know.</font>

464
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,080
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

465
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,840
<font color="yellow">You're an alumnus of
Myungsung University, right?</font>

466
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,830
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for someone.</font>

467
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:43,730
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to you later.</font>

468
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:51,400
<font color="yellow">Are you related to that cop somehow?
You say I killed Detective Mo?</font>

469
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,730
<font color="yellow">Talk now, you punk.
I want to leave before the sun goes down.</font>

470
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,020
<font color="yellow">Everyone here has family at home.</font>

471
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,700
<font color="yellow">I heard that your siblings
don't treat you like a human being</font>

472
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,230
<font color="yellow">since your parents died.</font>

473
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,860
<font color="yellow">You have no wife or child.
No friend in the world.</font>

474
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,370
<font color="yellow">You used the money you had left
to become a loan shark.</font>

475
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,760
<font color="yellow">You live a screwed up life,
taking money from people.</font>

476
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,210
<font color="yellow">You lived crawling in dirt like a bug.</font>

477
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:27,480
<font color="yellow">You haven't lived to see a good day,
and today is the end!</font>

478
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,770
<font color="yellow">The end! Is that what you want?</font>

479
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:32,920
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

480
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,260
<font color="yellow">What is the big secret that you're
keeping that stinky mouth shut?</font>

481
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,260
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

482
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,910
<font color="yellow">Tell me now, you punk!</font>

483
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,540
<font color="yellow">Let the kid go and we'll talk.</font>

484
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,790
<font color="yellow">I want to do that too.</font>

485
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,870
<font color="yellow">Why did you do something so stupid?</font>

486
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:01,530
<font color="yellow">The kid! Why would you bring a kid here?</font>

487
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,580
<font color="yellow">She has nothing to do with this,
so let her go!</font>

488
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,720
<font color="yellow">How can we just send her away?
She's seen all of our faces.</font>

489
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,250
<font color="yellow">Put Chi Soo deep in the ground tonight.</font>

490
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,930
<font color="yellow">- And you...
- I said she has nothing to do with this.</font>

491
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,470
<font color="yellow">She looks very smart with a good memory.</font>

492
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,430
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

493
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

494
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,600
<font color="yellow">I have a disease, so I forget everything.</font>

495
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:39,220
<font color="yellow">My memories will start to disappear
and I won't be able to move my body.</font>

496
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,060
<font color="yellow">So, you don't need to worry.</font>

497
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,040
<font color="yellow">What is she saying?</font>

498
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,160
<font color="yellow">Are you people playing a joke here?</font>

499
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,870
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey! Kid.</font>

500
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:05,260
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's wrong? What's wrong with her?</font>

501
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,940
<font color="yellow">Hey, wake up.</font>

502
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,390
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

503
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,410
<font color="yellow">Are you going to kill a child?</font>

504
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,390
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you following him?</font>

505
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,730
<font color="yellow">I can't have that happening here.</font>

506
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,970
<font color="yellow">Put me down.</font>

507
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,790
<font color="yellow">I said, put me down.</font>

508
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,000
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Hurry up and run.</font>

509
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,230
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

510
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,970
<font color="yellow">I think I can breathe now.</font>

511
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,230
<font color="yellow">You... you just had a seizure.</font>

512
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,040
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you tell?
I was faking it.</font>

513
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,980
<font color="yellow">What could I do?</font>

514
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,260
<font color="yellow">They were hitting you, Mister.</font>

515
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,630
<font color="yellow">You really...</font>

516
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,070
<font color="yellow">It wasn't all a lie though.</font>

517
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,040
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

518
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,550
<font color="yellow">They say I will get like that later on.</font>

519
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

520
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,390
<font color="yellow">Once my illness gets worse,
my body will get stiff and I'll shake.</font>

521
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,830
<font color="yellow">What did you call it before?</font>

522
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,570
<font color="yellow">A seizure?</font>

523
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,410
<font color="yellow">I'll get those.</font>

524
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:51,060
<font color="yellow">If it gets worse than that,
I won't be able to swallow my food.</font>

525
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,950
<font color="yellow">Is this a storage space?</font>

526
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,850
<font color="yellow">You don't live here, do you?</font>

527
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,560
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't say I live here.</font>

528
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,120
<font color="yellow">It's so dark and gloomy.</font>

529
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,680
<font color="yellow">I feel like a ghost might pop out.</font>

530
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,950
<font color="yellow">If you are sick...</font>

531
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,080
<font color="yellow">are you taking medicine?</font>

532
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,640
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. I have to take it.</font>

533
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:43,820
<font color="yellow">By the way, how come you're not
answering the question I asked before?</font>

534
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,580
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

535
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,120
<font color="yellow">How did you meet my mom 10 years ago?</font>

536
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,990
<font color="yellow">I just met her while
I was coming and going.</font>

537
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,410
<font color="yellow">You're saying the same thing as her.</font>

00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,880
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

540
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,660
<font color="yellow">Please help out the poor.</font>

541
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,070
<font color="yellow">Please donate to the poor.</font>

542

<font color="yellow">Please donate to the poor.</font>

543
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,080
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

544
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,210
<font color="yellow">I actually called you earlier.</font>

545
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,000
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. You came quickly.</font>

546
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,270
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for him anyway?</font>

547
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,290
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen him in about
seven or eight years either.</font>

548
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:48,410
<font color="yellow">I have to find him and
have him meet someone.</font>

549
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,670
<font color="yellow">Please help me.</font>

550
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,680
<font color="yellow">What are you people doing?
Why are destroying my house?</font>

551
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,970
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?
This isn't a house.</font>

552
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,670
<font color="yellow">How can you pitch a tent at a park?</font>

553
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,580
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know that but...</font>

554
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,290
<font color="yellow">You just can't take it down now.</font>

555
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:37,480
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous.</font>

556
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,810
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up and take it down.
- Yes, sir.</font>

557
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,380
<font color="yellow">Hey, seriously!</font>

558
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,440
<font color="yellow">- You can't do this!
- Don't interrupt our work.</font>

559
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,310
<font color="yellow">You can't remove it!</font>

560
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,410
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and remove it.</font>

561
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,430
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Hurry it up.</font>

562
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,290
<font color="yellow">Hold this.</font>

563
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,720
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and get rid of it.</font>

564
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,580
<font color="yellow">Little Miss Geum Bi.</font>

565
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,960
<font color="yellow">Have you still been
kissing Jae Ha lately?</font>

566
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,720
<font color="yellow">What about Shil La?</font>

567
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,930
<font color="yellow">Is she still jealous?</font>

568
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,310
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

569
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,320
<font color="yellow">Your dad is...</font>

570
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,510
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi?</font>

571
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,100
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Say something.</font>

572
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,740
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you mad again?</font>

573
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,670
<font color="yellow">Who are you, Mister?</font>

574
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:15,780
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

575
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,100
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

576
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, Geum Bi.</font>

577
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,540
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?
Did you follow me?</font>

578
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,670
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

579
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,370
<font color="yellow">I came because I missed you, Geum Bi.</font>

580
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,590
<font color="yellow">You're okay, right?</font>

581
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,440
<font color="yellow">Why? Did something happen?</font>

582
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,730
<font color="yellow">Oh no.</font>

583
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,960
<font color="yellow">By any chance, did I not recognize you?</font>

584
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,010
<font color="yellow">No, that didn't happen.</font>

585
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,540
<font color="yellow">It did happen.</font>

586
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,460
<font color="yellow">I told you it didn't.</font>

587
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

588
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

589
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,100
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

590
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,450
<font color="yellow">Can you see Dad?</font>

591
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,500
<font color="yellow">I see you.</font>

592
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:49,930
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

593
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,070
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened. It's okay.</font>

594
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:58,400
<font color="yellow">What happens if I can't recognize you?</font>

595
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,710
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It doesn't matter.</font>

596
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,380
<font color="yellow">Whether you recognize me or not,
it doesn't matter.</font>

597
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,770
<font color="yellow">Even if the sky splits in two
or the world ends...</font>

598
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,750
<font color="yellow">I am still Geum Bi's dad.</font>

599
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,870
<font color="yellow">You understand, right?</font>

600
