00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,900
<font color="yellow">I have to speak with my guests,
so go and wait inside, Geum Bi.</font>

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,900
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, these people?
They're here to help me with something.</font>

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,490
<font color="yellow">What, exactly?</font>

7
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,600
<font color="yellow">Just... something complicated.</font>

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,800
<font color="yellow">- That mister over there is...
- Hey, no, Geum Bi!</font>

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,600
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,100
<font color="yellow">How did you know to
come here, my Geum Bi?</font>

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
<font color="yellow">Do you know Geum Bi?</font>

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
<font color="yellow">He's trying to...</font>

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,800
<font color="yellow">Why do you have stuff
all over your mouth?</font>

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,310
<font color="yellow">You're 10 years old.
You should know better.</font>

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,600
<font color="yellow">- Get off me!
- Hey!</font>

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,690
<font color="yellow">What a good girl.</font>

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,300
<font color="yellow">I told you to get off me!</font>

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,100
<font color="yellow">- You know, this mister...
- Hey!</font>

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling your dad "Mister"?</font>

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,000
<font color="yellow">"Dad"?</font>

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,300
<font color="yellow">Looks like my Geum Bi is
upset about something again.</font>

22
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,800
<font color="yellow">She calls me "Dad" when she's happy,
but I'm "Mister" otherwise.</font>

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,000
<font color="yellow">Since when have you been a dad to me?</font>

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,300
<font color="yellow">Dad will yell at you if you
keep acting this way, Geum Bi.</font>

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,280
<font color="yellow">What are you doing
in front of all these adults?</font>

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
<font color="yellow">Oh, this won't do. Come with me!</font>

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
<font color="yellow">You need a scolding.</font>

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,410
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee!</font>

30
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,390
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Wait, sir! Wait!</font>

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,100
<font color="yellow">This won't do. Strike.</font>

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,360
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,890
<font color="yellow">You know, that thing you're great at.</font>

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,690
<font color="yellow">When I give you the signal, strike.
I'll take care of the rest.</font>

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,300
<font color="yellow">I told you, let go!
I have to talk to her!</font>

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,890
<font color="yellow">That lady and mister over there
planned all this, and...</font>

<font color="yellow">Child!</font>

38

<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang Hee.</font>

41
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,190
<font color="yellow">Don't agree to this deal.</font>

42
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
<font color="yellow">Those people seem a bit suspicious to me.</font>

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,690
<font color="yellow">I feel that they may be
trying to scam you.</font>

45
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,290
<font color="yellow">And this weighed on my conscience,
so I couldn't just sit and watch.</font>

46
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,500
<font color="yellow">Those terrible con artists.</font>

47
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,000
<font color="yellow">You bastard!</font>

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,600
<font color="yellow">I knew something
seemed a bit off about you.</font>

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,790
<font color="yellow">You think you'll be safe after
stabbing us in the back like this?</font>

50
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,790
<font color="yellow">Strike!</font>

51
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,290
<font color="yellow">You asshole.</font>

52
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,530
<font color="yellow">That's a nice couch you've got there.</font>

53
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,600
<font color="yellow">I'm going to end things here
since he's found me out</font>

54
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,690
<font color="yellow">so don't blow things
out of proportion.</font>

55
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,040
<font color="yellow">If I hear anything about you telling
people that we're scammers...</font>

56
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
<font color="yellow">I'll make you regret it.</font>

57
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,000
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever show your
face in front of me again.</font>

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,900
<font color="yellow">If you do, I'll throw you
to the wolves on Jiri Mountain.</font>

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,690
<font color="yellow">Just try me!</font>

60
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,190
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

61
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,100
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's go!</font>

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,400
<font color="yellow">Wait, you...</font>

63
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,100
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

64
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,600
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

65
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,030
<font color="yellow">Geez! Why did you go all-out?</font>

66
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,000
<font color="yellow">Were you trying to kill him,
or something?</font>

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,400
<font color="yellow">I can't control myself
once I'm in the air.</font>

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,190
<font color="yellow">You're like a damned bear on a rampage!</font>

69
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,780
<font color="yellow">He's weird in the head as it is.
What if he has terrible aftereffects?</font>

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,290
<font color="yellow">You'll have to take
responsibility for him!</font>

71
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,100
<font color="yellow">The hell?</font>

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,190
<font color="yellow">You're the one who told me to do that!</font>

73
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,100
<font color="yellow">Shut it!</font>

74
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,400
<font color="yellow">To hell with him.</font>

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,200
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

76
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
<font color="yellow">Mister!</font>

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
<font color="yellow">You should lie down for a bit longer.</font>

78
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,990
<font color="yellow">Oh... I'm fine now. Yes.</font>

79
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,900
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,
I was able to avoid something terrible.</font>

80
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,600
<font color="yellow">But because of me, you...</font>

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

82
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,790
<font color="yellow">I mean, I am an appraiser, so I can't
stand to see people toying with artwork.</font>

83
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,990
<font color="yellow">Yeah, that's it.</font>

84
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,400
<font color="yellow">Are you really all right?</font>

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,900
<font color="yellow">Yes. But...</font>

86
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,600
<font color="yellow">don't report them please.</font>

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,120
<font color="yellow">If you do, they might try to
do something against you.</font>

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,790
<font color="yellow">So I think it'd be best
to just let the matter drop.</font>

89
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,290
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

90
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,400
<font color="yellow">So are you telling me that you were
deceived by those people, too, Mister?</font>

91
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop calling me "Mister."</font>

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,600
<font color="yellow">It's making your dad upset
to hear such a thing.</font>

93
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,600
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.
I really can't.</font>

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,290
<font color="yellow">It seems that I've
stayed here far too long.</font>

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,100
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Geum Bi.</font>

96
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
<font color="yellow">Um, wait.
That's not the way out.</font>

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,490
<font color="yellow">- It's this way.
- Oh, yes.</font>

98
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,700
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that way.</font>

99
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,100
<font color="yellow">- It's that way.
- Yes, I see.</font>

100
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,900
<font color="yellow">- I'll give you a call again!
- Yes, yes.</font>

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,110
<font color="yellow">Don't even dream of it.</font>

102
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,810
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

103
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,290
<font color="yellow">You're making it way too obvious.</font>

104
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, squirt.
Be a bit more specific.</font>

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,990
<font color="yellow">Even a puppy would know that
you've fallen hard for Kang Hee.</font>

106
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,730
<font color="yellow">Your eyes are all over the place
and your mouth has a stupid grin on it.</font>

107
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,990
<font color="yellow">I thought you were drooling,
for a second there!</font>

108
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,400
<font color="yellow">What do you know, punk?</font>

109
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,290
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you,
you'll just end up hurt in the end.</font>

110
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,450
<font color="yellow">Geez, you ugly little...</font>

111
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,290
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

112
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,990
<font color="yellow">You were about to con the woman you like.</font>

113
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,640
<font color="yellow">Is this supposed to be some
sort of twisted, romantic surprise?</font>

114
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,200
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare try to con Kang Hee.</font>

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,290
<font color="yellow">If you do, I'll report you
to the cops right away.</font>

116
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,200
<font color="yellow">You're the con artist, here!</font>

117
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

118
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,790
<font color="yellow">At the buffet restaurant at that hotel.</font>

119
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,900
<font color="yellow">You told her a fake fortune
and got money off her.</font>

120
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,010
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to
get money to pay for our meal.</font>

121
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,790
<font color="yellow">Also, I didn't tell her a fake fortune!</font>

122
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,580
<font color="yellow">You have no right to say anything
if you have no experience in it.</font>

123
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,290
<font color="yellow">So what did you say to
Ms. Kang Hee back then, anyway?</font>

124
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,990
<font color="yellow">I told you. That's not something
to discuss with other people.</font>

125
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,600
<font color="yellow">Come on, tell me already!</font>

126
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,520
<font color="yellow">Hey! You ugly little...</font>

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,400
<font color="yellow">You're even uglier, Mister!</font>

128
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,790
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

129
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,900
<font color="yellow">Hey, what is this?</font>

130
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,020
<font color="yellow">They can't do this just because
we're a little behind on rent!</font>

131
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,490
<font color="yellow">To be honest, letting us off the hook for
six months straight was quite generous.</font>

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,610
<font color="yellow">Let's split up and live alone, for now.</font>

133
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,910
<font color="yellow">We need to get a new contract
signed as soon as we can.</font>

134
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,600
<font color="yellow">Oh, what a cutie.</font>

135
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,900
<font color="yellow">Prepare yourself.</font>

136
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,790
<font color="yellow">You and I have hit rockbottom.</font>

137
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,900
<font color="yellow">If we fail this one,
we're done for. You got that?</font>

138
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,990
<font color="yellow">Are you mad at me because
I unleashed my flying kick on him?</font>

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,890
<font color="yellow">How could you think of
a guy like him as your dad?</font>

140
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, here. Here.</font>

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,390
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

142
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,700
<font color="yellow">Sorry, okay?</font>

143
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,800
<font color="yellow">Where do we go now?</font>

144
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,890
<font color="yellow">"We?"</font>

145
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,200
<font color="yellow"><i>[SKY ORPHANAGE -
ONE KILOMETER AWAY]</i></font>

146
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,600
<font color="yellow">Don't go! Don't go!</font>

147
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,940
<font color="yellow">I told you, I don't want to
go to an orphanage!</font>

148
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,250
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

149
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,080
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

150
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,200
<font color="yellow">I asked you where we're going.</font>

151
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:58,300
<font color="yellow">Yeah, so, isn't there a way I could
send her off to an orphanage?</font>

152
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,800
<font color="yellow">If I just drop her off,
she'll report me to the cops!</font>

153
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,100
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

154
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,600
<font color="yellow">Bye for now.</font>

155
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, peel those eggs later.</font>

156
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,800
<font color="yellow">Now I want you to give me a
straight answer to all of my questions.</font>

157
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,410
<font color="yellow">Sincerely, and with gusto.
You got that?</font>

158
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,800
<font color="yellow">I do, but what part of that makes it
necessary for me to stop peeling eggs?</font>

159
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,300
<font color="yellow">Fine. You can keep peeling them.</font>

160
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,300
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

161
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,950
<font color="yellow">About your mom.</font>

162
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,390
<font color="yellow">You really don't remember her?</font>

163
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,990
<font color="yellow">How could I, when I've never seen her?</font>

164
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,890
<font color="yellow">You've seen her, though, Mister.
You even slept with her.</font>

165
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,390
<font color="yellow">So why can't you remember?</font>

166
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,200
<font color="yellow">What did you have for lunch a week ago?</font>

167
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
<font color="yellow">Who would remember
little details like that?</font>

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

169
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,990
<font color="yellow">You can't even remember
what you ate a week ago</font>

170
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,890
<font color="yellow">so how do you expect me to
remember something from 10 years ago?</font>

171
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,990
<font color="yellow">I've slept with tons of women in my life.</font>

172
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,100
<font color="yellow">Your aunt really didn't
tell you anything?</font>

173
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

174
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,740
<font color="yellow">You may be a little punk,
but you have a sharp wit</font>

175
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,070
<font color="yellow">so I'm sure you've realized
the nature of the situation.</font>

176
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,480
<font color="yellow">- You know, you and I...
- I know.</font>

177
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,890
<font color="yellow">You got evicted, right?</font>

178
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,990
<font color="yellow">Because you couldn't
pay your rent, Mister.</font>

179
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,990
<font color="yellow">But how come you can't
make any money, Mister?</font>

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,490
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm trying to make some now.</font>

181
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:50,100
<font color="yellow">But if I'm to take care of you properly,
I can't make money how I usually do.</font>

182
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
<font color="yellow">So, that's why...</font>

183
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,990
<font color="yellow">Why are you beating around the bush?</font>

184
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,490
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

185
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,490
<font color="yellow">You're telling me to go to an orphanage.</font>

186
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,890
<font color="yellow">Well, um... yeah.</font>

187
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,890
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

188
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,890
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this since you
seem to understand, but...</font>

189
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,390
<font color="yellow">I'm not going.</font>

190
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,890
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

191
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,650
<font color="yellow">I said, I'm not going to an orphanage.</font>

192
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,890
<font color="yellow">You don't know what a dire
situation we're in right now, do you?</font>

193
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,990
<font color="yellow">This isn't the time for you
to be having a tantrum.</font>

194
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,100
<font color="yellow">You're saying that because
you don't know this</font>

195
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,890
<font color="yellow">but I can't afford to waste
any time at a place like that.</font>

196
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,800
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

197
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,300
<font color="yellow">I have to hurry and go to sleep
since I have school tomorrow.</font>

198
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,890
<font color="yellow">Feel free to run away while
I'm asleep, if you want to.</font>

199
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,300
<font color="yellow">You think I won't be able to?</font>

200
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,990
<font color="yellow">46-du-1985.</font>

201
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,200
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

202
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,800
<font color="yellow">You don't even know your
own license plate number?</font>

203
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,940
<font color="yellow">Want me to recite your
social security number, too?</font>

204
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,100
<font color="yellow">Why, you little...</font>

205
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,800
<font color="yellow">Did you look through my wallet?</font>

206
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,300
<font color="yellow">- Yep.
- When?</font>

207
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
<font color="yellow">Why does that even matter?</font>

208
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, you...</font>

209
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,990
<font color="yellow">Wow, that little...</font>

210
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,590
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

211
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,890
<font color="yellow">What do I do with her?</font>

212
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,990
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

213
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,600
<font color="yellow"><i>[POLICE]</i></font>

214
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't you dare call that number.</font>

215
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,990
<font color="yellow">You should've been here on time
if you made a promise!</font>

216
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,600
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many
bad guys are out there?</font>

217
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,540
<font color="yellow">They kidnap kids, and things like that.</font>

218
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,550
<font color="yellow">They have bad hearts, not bad eyes.</font>

219
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,300
<font color="yellow">Where did you go?</font>

220
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
<font color="yellow">To get us a place to live.</font>

221
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,990
<font color="yellow">It's supposed to rain today, though.</font>

222
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,990
<font color="yellow">Do you really believe that?</font>

223
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:22,014
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd

224
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,700
<font color="yellow">We're not supposed
to have an open flame here.</font>

225
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,460
<font color="yellow">You know, the thing
about the adult world</font>

226
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,800
<font color="yellow">is that you really can't get by
if you always follow the rules.</font>

227
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,800
<font color="yellow">You're so lucky.</font>

228
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,990
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

229
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,990
<font color="yellow">Because you're a child.</font>

230
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,390
<font color="yellow">What if you start a fire?</font>

231
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,890
<font color="yellow">There's nothing flammable around here.
It's completely desolate.</font>

232
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,890
<font color="yellow">Turn the stove off.</font>

233
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,700
<font color="yellow">- It's fine.
- It's not that.</font>

234
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,390
<font color="yellow">You're overcooking the ramen!</font>

235
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,990
<font color="yellow">Ramen isn't good unless
you overcook it a little!</font>

236
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,300
<font color="yellow">What's so great about
disgustingly overcooked noodles?</font>

237
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,270
<font color="yellow">It only tastes good when
it still has a bit of a bite!</font>

238
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,990
<font color="yellow">Why would you even
bother cooking it, then?</font>

239
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,100
<font color="yellow">You might as well eat it raw,
like a biscuit!</font>

240
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,580
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

241
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,650
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

242
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,800
<font color="yellow">Why, you...</font>

243
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

244
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,390
<font color="yellow">You little!</font>

245
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,190
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about this?</font>

246
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,890
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd do this! I knew it!</font>

247
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,990
<font color="yellow">That was the last packet of ramen we had!</font>

248
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,890
<font color="yellow">I don't even have money to buy ramen!</font>

249
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,600
<font color="yellow">See, I told you that it'd rain!</font>

250
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,600
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It's a waterproof tent.</font>

251
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,600
<font color="yellow">Waterproof, huh?</font>

252
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,990
<font color="yellow">Yeah. It is.</font>

253
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,390
<font color="yellow">See? The water that's
in here isn't draining.</font>

254
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,300
<font color="yellow">What is this? Are we going
to sit like this all night?</font>

255
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, squirt.</font>

256
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,200
<font color="yellow">Elementary schoolers go to boot camps
and the like during vacations, right?</font>

257
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,800
<font color="yellow">And you even pay to go to those things.</font>

258
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,300
<font color="yellow">So you should be able to
handle at least this much.</font>

259
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,890
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right,
Little Miss Geum Bi?</font>

260
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,800
<font color="yellow">Sure, fine. Let's do it,
then, and try to have fun.</font>

261
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,800
<font color="yellow">Gee, what a fun-filled
boot camp experience!</font>

262
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,690
<font color="yellow">I'm starving!</font>

263
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,890
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep, then! None of that
will matter when you're asleep!</font>

264
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,300
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to sleep in here
when it's all flooded?</font>

265
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,840
<font color="yellow">You're so annoying.
And ugly, to boot!</font>

266
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,100
<font color="yellow">Stop moving!
You're making the tent shift!</font>

267
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,500
<font color="yellow">Geez, you...</font>

268
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,800
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep!</font>

269
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,300
<font color="yellow">What did you have for dinner
last night, Jae Ha?</font>

270
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,890
<font color="yellow">I had risotto at a restaurant.</font>

271
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,600
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

272
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,300
<font color="yellow">I had beef.</font>

273
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,690
<font color="yellow">I had steak.</font>

274
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, take a shower once in
a while, why don't you?</font>

275
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,800
<font color="yellow">Do you not even have
running water at home?</font>

276
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,800
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I have water?
My place is practically flooded with it.</font>

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,100
<font color="yellow">You reek!</font>

278
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,600
<font color="yellow">No, she doesn't.</font>

279
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,800
<font color="yellow">Take a good whiff.
She smells like a sewer!</font>

280
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
<font color="yellow">How is this a sewer smell?</font>

281
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,390
<font color="yellow">Ew, get that out of my face!
How disgusting!</font>

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,190
<font color="yellow">Hello, Teacher!</font>

283
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,600
<font color="yellow">Why, you little...</font>

284
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,600
<font color="yellow">Shil La.</font>

285
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,500
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

286
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,390
<font color="yellow">Bring all your agenda
books to me, everyone.</font>

287
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,500
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi. Did something happen at home?</font>

288
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

289
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,890
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

290
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,100
<font color="yellow">Enjoy!</font>

291
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

292
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,800
<font color="yellow">Enjoy, or something.</font>

293
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,100
<font color="yellow">Hey! These are way too small!</font>

294
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,510
<font color="yellow">Give me one more!</font>

295
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,300
<font color="yellow">How could I do that?
It's two per person.</font>

296
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,150
<font color="yellow">You should do it fairly!</font>

297
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,130
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I did.
I gave you two.</font>

298
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,800

when you turn on the water.</font>

444
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,300
<font color="yellow">If it is, water will get everywhere.</font>

445
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,600
<font color="yellow">Um, yes. I will.</font>

446
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,690
<font color="yellow">So your face gets hot when
you take a bath too, huh?</font>

447
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,890
<font color="yellow">The lady living next door
to us was like that, too.</font>

448
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,400
<font color="yellow">Huh? Oh.</font>

449
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,890
<font color="yellow">But still, your face is
way too overheated.</font>

450
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,100
<font color="yellow">Aren't you tired, Geum Bi?</font>

451
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,300
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

452
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,190
<font color="yellow">Want to get changed
and go to sleep?</font>

453
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,890
<font color="yellow">We're sleeping together?</font>

454
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,300
<font color="yellow">Why? You don't want to?</font>

455
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,800
<font color="yellow">No, I want to!</font>

456
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,390
<font color="yellow">Yes! Great job, Hwi Chul.
Great, great job.</font>

457
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,000
<font color="yellow">This means that our sacrifice
wasn't for naught.</font>

458
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah, exactly!</font>

459
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,390
<font color="yellow">If you've gotten in there,
you're almost done!</font>

460
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,890
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

461
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,600
<font color="yellow">Oh, yeah. Are you okay, even after
taking Jae Kyung's flying kick?</font>

462
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,000
<font color="yellow">You're so annoying! Why are
you calling so early in the morning?</font>

463
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,390
<font color="yellow">My ears are ringing. Bye.</font>

464
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,600
<font color="yellow">I said all right, already!
Do you have dementia, or something?</font>

465
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,300
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to
tell you the same thing?</font>

466
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,600
<font color="yellow">Yeah!</font>

467
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

468
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,190
<font color="yellow">Geez. Oh man.</font>

469
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,190
<font color="yellow"><i>Come and eat!</i></font>

470
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes!</font>

471
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,500
<font color="yellow">I got this for lunch today,
but I don't really like pork or milk.</font>

472
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,690
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure have a
healthy appetite!</font>

473
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,610
<font color="yellow">You like milk, don't you?</font>

474
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,600
<font color="yellow">But still, you need to
have a proper breakfast.</font>

475
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,790
<font color="yellow">So no more milk, okay?</font>

476
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,190
<font color="yellow">- Go and get your dad.
- Okay!</font>

477
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,900
<font color="yellow">Mister!</font>

478
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,690
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

479
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,290
<font color="yellow">She wants you to come and eat.</font>

480
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,500
<font color="yellow">Yeah, sure.</font>

481
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,500
<font color="yellow">I only got rice for us two.</font>

482
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,900
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you mad
that you get no rice?</font>

483
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,790
<font color="yellow">This is even better than rice.</font>

484
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,000
<font color="yellow">You don't even know.</font>

485
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,510
<font color="yellow">Really? Then trade with me.</font>

486
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,190
<font color="yellow">Stop being ridiculous.</font>

487
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,600
<font color="yellow">- Come on, let's trade.
- I said no!</font>

488
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,000
<font color="yellow">- I'll give you 500 won.
- I don't need it!</font>

489
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,000
<font color="yellow">Then hurry up and eat,
and earn your keep.</font>

490
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,290
<font color="yellow">The hell are you
going on about, now?</font>

491
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,500
<font color="yellow">You really don't need to do that.</font>

492
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:06,190
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine. You made me porridge,
so I should pay you back somehow.</font>

493
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,400
<font color="yellow">I thought we were meeting outside.</font>

494
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
<font color="yellow">Well, I had some extra time,
so I came to get you.</font>

495
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,100
<font color="yellow">And the front door was wide open, too.</font>

496
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,820
<font color="yellow">- I'll wait inside.
- Um...</font>

497
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,100
<font color="yellow">Take your time getting ready.</font>

498
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,600
<font color="yellow">Jae Jin, I'll meet you later.</font>

499
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,790
<font color="yellow">I'm done fixing your shower.</font>

500
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,290
<font color="yellow">Who's this guy?</font>

501
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,600
<font color="yellow">Well, yes. Your situation
does sound grim.</font>

502
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,290
<font color="yellow">But, still.</font>

503
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,400
<font color="yellow">I never thought that someone
like an art appraiser</font>

504
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,600
<font color="yellow">would have to be
living out of their car.</font>

505
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,000
<font color="yellow">Mr. Jae Jin!</font>

506
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,130
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of debt, you see...</font>

507
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,290
<font color="yellow">Oh, debt?</font>

508
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,900
<font color="yellow">But, you know...</font>

509
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,580
<font color="yellow">even people who build skyscrapers don't
finance all of that with their money.</font>

510
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,100
<font color="yellow">They all take on debts to do that.</font>

511
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,790
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

512
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,790
<font color="yellow">37.</font>

513
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,600
<font color="yellow">So you're practically 40 already.</font>

514
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
<font color="yellow">And yet, you have a
10-year-old daughter.</font>

515
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,000
<font color="yellow">And you live out of your car?</font>

516
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,600
<font color="yellow">Jae Jin, let's leave now.</font>

517
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,600
<font color="yellow">What, and leave these people in here?</font>

518
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,000
<font color="yellow">Do you want to reschedule
our plans for today, then?</font>

519
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,500
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

520
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,090
<font color="yellow">To have a male stranger staying in a home
where a woman lives alone for this long</font>

521
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,190
<font color="yellow">is not unacceptable,
don't you think?</font>

522
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,900
<font color="yellow">Yes, and I was actually on my way out.</font>

523
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
<font color="yellow">Why don't you do this, then?</font>

524
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,600
<font color="yellow">I'll get you a room in our hospital.</font>

525
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,290
<font color="yellow">You can receive treatment there.</font>

526
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,600
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'm not quite okay with
letting you stay there for free.</font>

527
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,400
<font color="yellow">So when you make
a full recovery, you can...</font>

528
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,320
<font color="yellow">do some odd jobs around the
hospital to pay your bill off.</font>

529
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,600
<font color="yellow">How about it?</font>

530
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,940
<font color="yellow">No. I'm fine now.</font>

531
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,400
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry
about your pride, here!</font>

532
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,000
<font color="yellow">It's okay to lean on others a bit
when you're in a bind.</font>

533
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,400
<font color="yellow">And you disregarded all that by
staying here yesterday, anyway.</font>

534
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, well...</font>

535
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,000

536
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,100
<font color="yellow">Little Miss Geum Bi. Let's go.</font>

537
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,790
<font color="yellow">Um, I'll be in touch with you.</font>

538
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,290
<font color="yellow">No, don't contact me.</font>

539
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,000
<font color="yellow">Are you angry?</font>

540
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,100
<font color="yellow">Angry? I have no right to be angry.</font>

541
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,100
<font color="yellow">Come over and play again, Geum Bi.</font>

542

who introduced that con artist to you.</font>

Someone more trustworthy.</font>

548
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,500

since my father was around.</font>

549
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sure this was just an
honest mistake on his part.</font>

550
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,360
<font color="yellow">Find someone with a conscience
who will give you a fair price</font>

551
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,620

fall for the lies of some scamming thugs!</font>

money to a trustworthy bank!</font>
