00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,480
<font color="yellow">I'd like to make some business propositions.</font>

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,450
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

316
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,050
<font color="yellow">What will happen to her?</font>

317
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,350
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

318
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,050
<font color="yellow">There is a gene called NPC1.</font>

319
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,950
<font color="yellow">It's a disease where that gene malfunctions.</font>

320
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,620
<font color="yellow">When it does, her cholesterol level rises abnormally.</font>

321
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,950
<font color="yellow">Since there are no enzymes to metabolize the lipids,</font>

322
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,880
<font color="yellow">it'll keep on piling up...</font>

323
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,750
<font color="yellow">in her liver, spleen, and brain.</font>

324
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
<font color="yellow">And what?</font>

325
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,150
<font color="yellow">When it develops,</font>

326
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,620
<font color="yellow">she'll have something called a myotonia.</font>

327
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,750
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard for her to walk.</font>

328
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,980
<font color="yellow">Her pronunciation will be unclear...</font>

329
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,820
<font color="yellow">and she will lose her ability to speak.</font>

330
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,950
<font color="yellow">Then her muscles will weaken rapidly.</font>

331
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,080
<font color="yellow">She may experience some seizures.</font>

332
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,950
<font color="yellow">Her intellectual ability will gradually decline...</font>

333
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,380
<font color="yellow">and display symptoms similar to Alzheimer's.</font>

334
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
<font color="yellow">Alzheimer's...</font>

335
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,650
<font color="yellow">Isn't that dementia?</font>

336
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,920
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

337
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,550
<font color="yellow">She's only 10 years old.</font>

338
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,220
<font color="yellow">She is very bright and has a great memory.</font>

339
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,920
<font color="yellow">My gosh. You must be mistaken.</font>

340
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,550
<font color="yellow">Let's say you're right.</font>

341
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,320
<font color="yellow">What will happen now?</font>

342
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,450
<font color="yellow">If this breaks out in babies,</font>

343
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,950
<font color="yellow">they'll die before preschool.</font>

344
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,180
<font color="yellow">If it breaks out after that, most die during teenage...</font>

345
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,950
<font color="yellow">Darn it. What are you talking about?</font>

346
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,250
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that she will die...</font>

347
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,250
<font color="yellow">before she turns 20?</font>

348
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,850
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

349
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,750
<font color="yellow">After the onset of this disease and the symptoms...</font>

350
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,820
<font color="yellow">develop, it will test your limit.</font>

351
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,120
<font color="yellow">Even if she's your own child,</font>

352
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,820
<font color="yellow">you'd want to abandon her and run away.</font>

353
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,580
<font color="yellow">Mr. Mo!</font>

354
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,220
<font color="yellow">Get a hold of yourself.</font>

355
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,680
<font color="yellow">And be honest with me.</font>

356
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

357
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,720
<font color="yellow">Are you capable of managing her?</font>

358
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

359
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,780
<font color="yellow">Can you take care of her until the end?</font>

360
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,550
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

361
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,120
<font color="yellow">What's with you?</font>

362
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,950
<font color="yellow">- What? - Why are you acting weird?</font>

363
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,050
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

364
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,520
<font color="yellow">Tell me the subway stations on line one.</font>

365
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,180
<font color="yellow">Tell me!</font>

366
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,120
<font color="yellow">Which direction?</font>

367
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
<font color="yellow">Forget about that.</font>

368
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,280
<font color="yellow">Where's the place where we first ate?</font>

369
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,320
<font color="yellow">A buffet at a hotel.</font>

370
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
<font color="yellow">Name...</font>

371
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,950
<font color="yellow">What's my name?</font>

372
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,520
<font color="yellow">Mo Hwi Cheol.</font>

373
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,320
<font color="yellow">Who's the owner of this house? What's her name?</font>

374
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,980
<font color="yellow">Why? You don't know? Can't you remember?</font>

375
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,550
<font color="yellow">Can't you?</font>

376
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,250
<font color="yellow">She's Go Kang Hee.</font>

377
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,720
<font color="yellow">Why are you cooking a toothbrush?</font>

378
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,550
<font color="yellow">You need to sterilize it once in a while.</font>

379
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,420
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many germs are in a toothbrush?</font>

380
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,020
<font color="yellow">You still can't microwave it. It'll melt.</font>

381
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,550
<font color="yellow">You're suppose to microwave it for a minute.</font>

382
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,420
<font color="yellow">You don't even know anything.</font>

383
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,950
<font color="yellow">Bring your toothbrush, too.</font>

384
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sure your toothbrush is the dirtiest in town.</font>

385
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,020
<font color="yellow">Do we have ice cream?</font>

386
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,450
<font color="yellow">What are you making?</font>

387
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,020
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

388
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,780
<font color="yellow">There are some things you can only know in the end.</font>

389
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,820
<font color="yellow">How do you make it?</font>

390
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,420
<font color="yellow">Teach me.</font>

391
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
<font color="yellow">This?</font>

392
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,420
<font color="yellow">It's not for stupid kids.</font>

393
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,250
<font color="yellow">Not to mention ugly kids.</font>

394
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,250
<font color="yellow">But you can do it.</font>

395
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,020
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee.</font>

396
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,120
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

397
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going out to make some money.</font>

398
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,250
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

399
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,820
<font color="yellow">I told you I'd give you 1,000 dollars.</font>

400
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,380
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll need this.</font>

401
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,450
<font color="yellow">Let us stay here for just a little longer.</font>

402
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,550
<font color="yellow">If I work hard, I might be able to rent a room.</font>

403
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,450
<font color="yellow">This is good, right? I don't know the details, but...</font>

404
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,520
<font color="yellow">wouldn't studying abroad benefit you when you return?</font>

405
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,080
<font color="yellow">It's not exactly like that.</font>

406
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,350
<font color="yellow">You should go when you have the chance.</font>

407
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,120
<font color="yellow">Don't regret it later.</font>

408
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,820
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

409
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,950
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which,</font>

410
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,420
<font color="yellow">I can't let a stranger look after this house.</font>

411
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,220
<font color="yellow">I want you to live here and take care of it.</font>

412
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,150
<font color="yellow">You must pity me.</font>

413
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,820
<font color="yellow">Homes are bound to break down without people living in.</font>

414
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,820
<font color="yellow">I'd rather have you and Geum Bi live here,</font>

415
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,420
<font color="yellow">and look after this house.</font>

416
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
<font color="yellow">You don't need to pay any rent.</font>

417
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:33,980
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to?</font>

418
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,820
<font color="yellow">I'm in no position to refuse.</font>

419
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,920
<font color="yellow">I'll accept the offer gladly.</font>

420
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,250
<font color="yellow">It's settled, then.</font>

421
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,320
<font color="yellow">Turn left.</font>

422
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,520
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Make a left turn.</font>

423
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,850
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

424
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,220
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

425
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,580
<font color="yellow">Try to get some sleep. You'll be home in no time</font>

426
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,980
<font color="yellow">Shut it and drive.</font>

427
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,320
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

428
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,420
<font color="yellow">- What? - I asked you how old you are.</font>

429
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,290
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

430
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,420
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Good.</font>

431
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,880
<font color="yellow">I got my keys back.</font>

432
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,520
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

433
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,450
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. It's 10 dollars short.</font>

434
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,620
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

435
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,850
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - What?</font>

436
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,980
<font color="yellow">It's 10 more dollars for the extra distance traveled.</font>

437
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,080
<font color="yellow">10 dollars, my foot.</font>

438
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,450
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a fool?</font>

439
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,980
<font color="yellow">How dare you try to con me?</font>

440
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,020
<font color="yellow">What did you say? I'm not conning you.</font>

441
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

442
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,920
<font color="yellow">Give me my 10 dollars!</font>

443
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,820
<font color="yellow">Give me that 10 dollars!</font>

444
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,050
<font color="yellow">Give me that 10 dollars.</font>

445
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,580
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me. - My goodness.</font>

446
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,790
<font color="yellow">I know martial arts, you fool.</font>

447
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,350
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's dad went to prison once.</font>

448
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,950
<font color="yellow">Is her dad broke?</font>

449
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,150
<font color="yellow">- There she is. - She's here.</font>

450
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,580
<font color="yellow">I heard your dad's been to prison once.</font>

451
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,880
<font color="yellow">Your dad might end up there, too. Tell him to behave.</font>

452
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,020
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

453
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,520
<font color="yellow">Hey. Why are you so rude?</font>

454
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,980
<font color="yellow">You guys must be a bad influence on me.</font>

455
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Hey!</font>

456
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,580
<font color="yellow">Guys. Don't even bother wasting your breath.</font>

457
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,520
<font color="yellow">The more you do, the more you'll become like her.</font>

458
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
<font color="yellow">Sil La.</font>

459
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,750
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good night sleep?</font>

460
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,180
<font color="yellow">- What? - What did you have for breakfast?</font>

461
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,880
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, guys.</font>

462
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,620
<font color="yellow">Eat well and sleep well.</font>

463
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,720
<font color="yellow">Listen to your teacher.</font>

464
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,020
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Hey!</font>

465
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,220
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to your after-school lessons?</font>

466
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,520
<font color="yellow">I'm not going.</font>

467
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,450
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

468
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,220
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

469
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,350

<font color="yellow">Let her watch.</font>

472
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,420
<font color="yellow">You should get along with her.</font>

473
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,850

479
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

<font color="yellow">So this is what it looks like.</font>

485
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,320
<font color="yellow">It's nothing much.</font>

486

<font color="yellow">You're brave.</font>

<font color="yellow">You still brought me here despite that.</font>

<font color="yellow">You don't know what you're talking about.</font>

505
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,620
<font color="yellow">So this is what it feels like.</font>

506

<font color="yellow">Yes, this is what it feels like.</font>

507
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,350

514
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,420
<font color="yellow">You told me not to mention her.</font>

515
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,620
<font color="yellow">If she were like you, she'd have loved to drink.</font>

516

<font color="yellow">What are you up to now?</font>

517

<font color="yellow">You can sell the antiques.</font>

525
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,420
<font color="yellow">I'll do as you say.</font>

<font color="yellow">Where will you go?</font>

529
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,250
<font color="yellow">Far away.</font>

530
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,450

531
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,950
<font color="yellow">I'll see when I get there.</font>

532
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,620
<font color="yellow">She'd have liked bitter coffee.</font>

533
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,520
<font color="yellow">Just like you.</font>

534
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,750
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't have liked to drink.</font>

535
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,380
<font color="yellow">Just like Dad.</font>

536
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,820
<font color="yellow">She would have, right?</font>

537
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,120
<font color="yellow">It was all my fault.</font>

538
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,450
<font color="yellow">You were only 15 years old.</font>

539
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,720
<font color="yellow">I was old enough to look after my six-year-old sister.</font>

<font color="yellow">That little girl...</font>

541

<font color="yellow">Are you caring for her for Jun Hee's sake?</font>

542
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,480
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

543
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,750
<font color="yellow">It's wrong to be nice to a girl...</font>

544
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,480
<font color="yellow">hoping she'll fill the void of a dead sister.</font>

545
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,080
<font color="yellow">What if it's not like that?</font>

546
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,680
<font color="yellow">It's like that.</font>

547
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,820
<font color="yellow">It may have been in the beginning,</font>

548
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,050
<font color="yellow">but what if I just want to keep her around...</font>

549
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,750
<font color="yellow">regardless of the circumstances?</font>

550
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,080
<font color="yellow">You said you're going far away.</font>

551
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,580
<font color="yellow">I hadn't seen it in 17 years.</font>

553
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,150
<font color="yellow">It had been 17 years.</font>

554

<font color="yellow">Don't delude yourself and look closely.</font>

555

<font color="yellow">You may be deceived into smiling.</font>

556
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,050
<font color="yellow">You should learn to smile as well.</font>

557

<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

558
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,650
<font color="yellow">I won't see you off.</font>

559
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,680
<font color="yellow">I think we got off at the wrong station.</font>

560
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,580
<font color="yellow">I don't just think so.</font>

561
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it.</font>

562

<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

563
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,150
<font color="yellow">Is she not home?</font>

576
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,420
<font color="yellow">She should be.</font>

577
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,850
<font color="yellow">She isn't. The house is empty.</font>

578
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,880
<font color="yellow">Where did that girl go?</font>

579
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,850
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

580
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's 10 years old and in 3rd grade.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes, Yoo Geum Bi.</font>

582
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,380

<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

585
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,820

590
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,320
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

591
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,620
<font color="yellow">Was this deliberate?</font>

592
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,620

595
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:47,380
<font color="yellow">What time is it? You didn't call or pick up!</font>

596
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,180
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this on purpose?</font>

597
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,450
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make me angry?</font>

598
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,050
<font color="yellow">It wasn't that.</font>

599
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,680
<font color="yellow">You're scaring her.</font>

600
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,720
<font color="yellow">Is this funny?</font>

601
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,550
<font color="yellow">Do you think making people upset is funny?</font>

602
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,180

00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,180
<font color="yellow">How dare you call me mister?</font>

606
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,480
<font color="yellow">I'm your dad!</font>

607
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,350
<font color="yellow">Can I call you that?</font>

608
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,420
<font color="yellow">What kind of question is that? Of course, you can!</font>

609
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,350
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

610
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,580
<font color="yellow">If you call me mister one more time,</font>

611
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,250
<font color="yellow">I'll sew your mouth shut!</font>

612
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,420
<font color="yellow">Who said you can cry?</font>

613
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,180
<font color="yellow">I'm crying because I'm sorry.</font>

614
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,120
<font color="yellow">I won't let you off, though.</font>

615

<font color="yellow">If you're going to cry, make some noise!</font>

616
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,180
<font color="yellow">Don't keep it all bottled up!</font>

617
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,520
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep.</font>

618
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,680
<font color="yellow">How can I when you're staring at me like that?</font>

619
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,020
<font color="yellow">Sleep now.</font>

620
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,380
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to sit there for?</font>

621
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,780
<font color="yellow">Why? Should I go out?</font>

622
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:26,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

623
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,080
<font color="yellow">How long do you want me to stay?</font>

624
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,850
<font color="yellow">Until I fall asleep.</font>

625
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,320
