<font color="yellow">which occurs when both parents are carriers.</font>

138
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,740
<font color="yellow">Half of Geum Bi's illness is...</font>

139

140
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,410

141
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,540
<font color="yellow">let someone like you have her.</font>

142
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,940
<font color="yellow">I will annul your petty parental rights.</font>

143
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,040
<font color="yellow">I only have knowledge about trees,</font>

144
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,940
<font color="yellow">so let me talk a little bit about them.</font>

145
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,770
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, two trees are fused by a branch.</font>

146
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,170
<font color="yellow">We dig them up to see if they have the same roots,</font>

147
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,210
<font color="yellow">but they each have their own roots.</font>

148
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,840
<font color="yellow">In human terms, they are strangers...</font>

149
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,940
<font color="yellow">living together as one.</font>

150
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
<font color="yellow">Hugging trees.</font>

151
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,940
<font color="yellow">That's what we call these two trees.</font>

152
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,040
<font color="yellow">Hugging trees.</font>

153
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,170
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi and you are like these trees.</font>

154
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,510
<font color="yellow">You two may not be blood-related,</font>

155
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,670
<font color="yellow">but you two are a loving dad and a daughter.</font>

156
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,340
<font color="yellow">That's what you and Geum Bi are.</font>

159
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,870
<font color="yellow">"Princess Elizabeth lived in a castle."</font>

161
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,970
<font color="yellow">Come to school on time. You are not in college.</font>

162

163
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,840
<font color="yellow">Did it stop somewhere?</font>

164
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,540
<font color="yellow">Why? Don't you remember?</font>

165
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,370
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I remember?</font>

166
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,140

<font color="yellow">Yes, Geum Bi. Say hello.</font>

171
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,070
<font color="yellow">I got this for lunch at school,</font>

172
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,940
<font color="yellow">but I don't like pork or milk.</font>

173

<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

175
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,670
<font color="yellow">And one more thing.</font>

176
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,540
<font color="yellow">Don't call me Mister. I'm your dad!</font>

179
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,940
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

180
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,640
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

181
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,740
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. What's your name again?</font>

182
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
<font color="yellow">Eun Bi?</font>

183
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,170
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

184

<font color="yellow">Okay. Geum Bi.</font>

185
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,240
<font color="yellow">You like your name because it means gold, right?</font>

186
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,940
<font color="yellow">No, it doesn't mean gold. It means silk.</font>

187
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Silk.</font>

188
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,540
<font color="yellow">What about Bi? Does that mean the rain?</font>

189
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,210
<font color="yellow">It means a crescent moon.</font>

190
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,540
<font color="yellow">My gosh, why doesn't it stand for a full moon?</font>

191
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,140
<font color="yellow">A crescent moon is so tiny.</font>

192
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,570
<font color="yellow">No, a crescent moon is prettier.</font>

193
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,470

195
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,240
<font color="yellow">A silky, crescent moon.</font>

196

200
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,870
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it if it's not funny.</font>

201
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,340
<font color="yellow">Just listen.</font>

202
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,410
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, two trees...</font>

203
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,270
<font color="yellow">are fused by a branch.</font>

204
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,410
<font color="yellow">When it's dug up to see if they have the same roots,</font>

205
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,640
<font color="yellow">they see that the two trees have different roots.</font>

206
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,110
<font color="yellow">If those trees were people...</font>

207

210
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880

211
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,210

466
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,640
<font color="yellow">That's a warning.</font>

467
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,570
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

468
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,340
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you a non-foul question.</font>

469
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
<font color="yellow">Ms. Yoo.</font>

470
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,370
<font color="yellow">Why did you give birth to her?</font>

471
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,710
<font color="yellow">You disappeared after leaving her with strangers.</font>

472
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,110
<font color="yellow">Why did you give birth to her...</font>

473
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,540
<font color="yellow">in the first place?</font>

474
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,240
<font color="yellow">How could I kill her?</font>

475
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,870
<font color="yellow">You may have offended the prosecutor,</font>

476
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,970
<font color="yellow">but it's not enough to overturn the verdict.</font>

477
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,280
<font color="yellow">We need something more critical.</font>

478
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,470
<font color="yellow">I didn't know. I didn't know those were drugs.</font>

479
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,370
<font color="yellow">I just did it a few times with Joo Young.</font>

480
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,870
<font color="yellow">I said no. Why should I see you?</font>

481
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
<font color="yellow">For you and me to live together,</font>

482
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,240
<font color="yellow">she has to give up her parental rights.</font>

483
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,840
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

484
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,470
<font color="yellow">she's never going to do that.</font>

485
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,070
<font color="yellow">Unless she gets herself into a huge trouble.</font>

486
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,810
<font color="yellow">I thought you didn't want to see me?</font>

487
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,940
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep calling? I'm busy.</font>

488
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,940
<font color="yellow">You know the prosecutor, so go and ask him.</font>

489
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,810
<font color="yellow">Kids should live with people with the same surname.</font>

490
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,710
<font color="yellow">I said I'm Mo Geum Bi.</font>

491
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,710
<font color="yellow">What kind of a name is that?</font>

492
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,940
<font color="yellow">If you were a Mo, I wouldn't have named you Geum Bi.</font>

493
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you bugging my dad?</font>

494
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,870
<font color="yellow">Your dad's the one bugging us.</font>

495
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,640
<font color="yellow">He's tearing us apart.</font>

496
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,710
<font color="yellow">He's ignoring the law, too.</font>

497
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,070
<font color="yellow">What kind of law is that?</font>

498
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,910
<font color="yellow">It won't let me stay with the people I like.</font>

499
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,370
<font color="yellow">I don't need laws like that.</font>

500
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,970
<font color="yellow">Even when you and Hwi Cheol aren't related,</font>

501
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,910
<font color="yellow">you grew to like him by living together.</font>

502
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,440
<font color="yellow">If you live with me...</font>

503
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,780
<font color="yellow">You didn't like your mom, either.</font>

504
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,040
<font color="yellow">When did I say that?</font>

505
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,910
<font color="yellow">You said you glared at her like I glared at you.</font>

506
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,610
<font color="yellow">Your memory's way too good.</font>

507
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,340
<font color="yellow">My eyes hurt.</font>

508
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,170
<font color="yellow">Are you thirsty?</font>

509
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,940
<font color="yellow">Stop glaring or your eyeballs will get cramps.</font>

510
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,340
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can shoot lasers?</font>

511
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,510
<font color="yellow">You have to live with me whether you live or die.</font>

512
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,470
<font color="yellow">- Why? - How many times do I have to tell you?</font>

513
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,710
<font color="yellow">I know, I know.</font>

514
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,870
<font color="yellow">What right do I have when I abandoned you?</font>

515
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,370
<font color="yellow">That's what you want to say, right?</font>

516
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of hearing that.</font>

517
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,370
<font color="yellow">I don't need a mom.</font>

518
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,370
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you don't.</font>

519
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,040
<font color="yellow">I felt the same once.</font>

520
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,570
<font color="yellow">But you need a mom until you're at least 20.</font>

521
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,410
<font color="yellow">I won't live that long.</font>

522
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,140
<font color="yellow">You're too young to drink coffee.</font>

523
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,840
<font color="yellow">Do you even like the taste?</font>

524
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,710
<font color="yellow">I'll find out when I try it.</font>

525
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,310
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

526
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,610
<font color="yellow">Is it bitter?</font>

527
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,740
<font color="yellow">That's what adults drink.</font>

528
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,740
<font color="yellow">We add tons of sugar and cream...</font>

529
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,040
<font color="yellow">because it's so bitter.</font>

530
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,110
<font color="yellow">We keep mixing things in.</font>

531
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,640
<font color="yellow">In the end,</font>

532
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,940
<font color="yellow">we forget what it originally tasted like.</font>

533
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,740
<font color="yellow">What does that taste like?</font>

534
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,910
<font color="yellow">This?</font>

535
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,870
<font color="yellow">I don't know how to explain what this is.</font>

536
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,210
<font color="yellow">Liquor's an adult drink, though.</font>

537
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,940
<font color="yellow">So what does it taste like?</font>

538
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,140
<font color="yellow">It tastes bitter like coffee,</font>

539
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,240
<font color="yellow">but it's a different kind of bitter.</font>

540
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,810
<font color="yellow">If the coffee is as bitter as it can be,</font>

541
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,280
<font color="yellow">the more awake you feel.</font>

542
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,310
<font color="yellow">If it dulls your senses, it's liquor.</font>

543
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,340
<font color="yellow">Give me some.</font>

544
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,070
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

545
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,410
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

546
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,570
<font color="yellow">Your life isn't bad enough for you to need this.</font>

547
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,240
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

548
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,910
<font color="yellow">Even if I am, stick to your coffee for today.</font>

549
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,940
<font color="yellow">You're drunk already.</font>

550
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,710
<font color="yellow">You pretend you can drink when you're a lightweight.</font>

551
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,110
<font color="yellow">Hey. I didn't drink that much.</font>

552
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,370
<font color="yellow">It's never-ending once I really start drinking.</font>

553
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,140
<font color="yellow">How much can you drink?</font>

554
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,840
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

555
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,940
<font color="yellow">I have to see.</font>

556
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,370
<font color="yellow">I think you're drunk. You should stop drinking.</font>

557
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,410
<font color="yellow">I'm just getting started. I can't stop already.</font>

558
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,410
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Can I have another bottle of this?</font>

559
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,240
<font color="yellow">Silly thing.</font>

560
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,510
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

561
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,110
<font color="yellow">It's great to be going home together.</font>

562
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,870
<font color="yellow">Walk properly, will you?</font>

563
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,670
<font color="yellow">I am walking properly.</font>

564
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,110
<font color="yellow">What's inside that makes people line up?</font>

565
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,710
<font color="yellow">Why are they wearing short skirts in this cold weather?</font>

566
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,540
<font color="yellow">Those places are more fun than you think.</font>

567
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,940
<font color="yellow">It's such a pity I can't show you around.</font>

568
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,810
<font color="yellow">I can.</font>

569
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

570
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,610
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

571
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,780
<font color="yellow">Do you like to dance?</font>

572
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,170
<font color="yellow">Dance?</font>

573
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you do.</font>

574
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,870
<font color="yellow">Whether you're good or not.</font>

575
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,870
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

576
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,410
<font color="yellow">Can I go inside?</font>

577
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,940
<font color="yellow">Of course. Your mom will take you inside.</font>

578
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,840
<font color="yellow">If my daughter wants to go inside,</font>

579
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,710
<font color="yellow">I'll take you with me. Come along.</font>

580
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,170
<font color="yellow">Move aside.</font>

581
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,710
<font color="yellow">Can't you see the line?</font>

582
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,070
<font color="yellow">The line? I'll stand in line.</font>

583
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,710
<font color="yellow">Then can I go in?</font>

584
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,110
<font color="yellow">Not with a kid.</font>

585
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,710
<font color="yellow">Minors under 18 aren't allowed inside.</font>

586
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,870
<font color="yellow">Age limits are nonsense.</font>

587
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,210
<font color="yellow">Aren't kids allowed to dance?</font>

588
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,340
<font color="yellow">Why aren't I allowed?</font>

589
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,140
<font color="yellow">This place isn't for children.</font>

590
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,310
<font color="yellow">What a joke.</font>

591
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

592
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,440
<font color="yellow">Anyone can have fun, adults and kids alike.</font>

593
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,610
<font color="yellow">So what if she's under 18?</font>

594
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,740
<font color="yellow">The law isn't everything. Step aside.</font>

595
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,570
<font color="yellow">Stop testing my patience.</font>

596
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,040
<font color="yellow">Get out of here.</font>

597
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,910
<font color="yellow">Too bad. We'll have to go.</font>

598
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,170
<font color="yellow">Did you think I meant that, you idiot?</font>

599
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,010
<font color="yellow">Move. Get out of the way.</font>

600
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,210
<font color="yellow">Get out of the way. You're so ugly.</font>

601
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:35,770
<font color="yellow">You're so fat.</font>

602
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,840
<font color="yellow">You witch.</font>

603
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,210
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

604
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,970
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Are you hurt?</font>

605
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,010
<font color="yellow">We can try again some other time.</font>

606
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,010
<font color="yellow">How dare you hurt my daughter, you jerk?</font>

607
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,810
<font color="yellow">What have you done? Are you out of your mind?</font>

608
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,940
<font color="yellow">How dare you hurt her?</font>

609
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,770
<font color="yellow">Did you just push me?</font>

610
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,670
<font color="yellow">I need to teach you a lesson.</font>

611
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,670
<font color="yellow">Get up, Geum Bi.</font>

612
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,970
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

613
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,170
<font color="yellow">If you want a fight, you've got one.</font>

614
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,970
<font color="yellow">- Fight me. - What's wrong with you?</font>

615
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,240
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

616
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,340
<font color="yellow">You jerk. Come back here.</font>

617
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,940
<font color="yellow">(Daddy Hwi Cheol)</font>

618
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:28,740
<font color="yellow">Is she not picking up?</font>

619
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,110
<font color="yellow">The silly thing...</font>

620
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,010
<font color="yellow">gets into trouble every day.</font>

621
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,070
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we go and look for her?</font>

622
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,770
<font color="yellow">Where would we even start?</font>

623
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,410
<font color="yellow">Let me...</font>

624
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

625
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,270
<font color="yellow">- See you later. - Let go of me.</font>

626
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,410
<font color="yellow">I said let me go.</font>

627
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,740
<font color="yellow">I will in a bit.</font>

628
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What did I do wrong?</font>

629
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,340
<font color="yellow">Everyone's pushing me around today.</font>

630
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,870
<font color="yellow">I've never seen a woman like you before.</font>

631
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
<font color="yellow">Is she your mom?</font>

632
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,340
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong?</font>

633
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,870
<font color="yellow">It hurts.</font>

634
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,010
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

635
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,970
<font color="yellow">Yoo Geum Bi.</font>

636
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,540
<font color="yellow">Do you know where you got that name?</font>

637
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,970
<font color="yellow">Geum means silk...</font>

638
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,370
<font color="yellow">and Bi means a crescent moon.</font>

639
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,270
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed to say this...</font>

640
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,010
<font color="yellow">but I don't know the Chinese characters for your name.</font>

641
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,110
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

642
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,840
<font color="yellow">I named you.</font>

643
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,710
<font color="yellow">I paid someone to come up with some names,</font>

644
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,170
<font color="yellow">but none of them suited you.</font>

645
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,140
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

646
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,140
<font color="yellow">You were so pretty when you were a baby.</font>

647
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,640
<font color="yellow">How dare he come up with such stupid names?</font>

648
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,540
<font color="yellow">One of them was "Sam Soon".</font>

649
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,340
<font color="yellow">You had...</font>

650
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,770
<font color="yellow">long and dark eyelashes.</font>

651
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,340
<font color="yellow">Just like a crescent moon.</font>

652
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:40,140
<font color="yellow">I could stare at you all day...</font>

653
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,140
<font color="yellow">and not get sick of you.</font>

654
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,410
<font color="yellow">So I named you Geum Bi.</font>

655
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,370
<font color="yellow">Hoping that...</font>

656
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,840
<font color="yellow">you'd have a life as smooth as silk.</font>

657
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,540
<font color="yellow">And grow up to be as pretty as a crescent moon.</font>

658
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,570
<font color="yellow">I found out later that...</font>

659
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,040
<font color="yellow">your name...</font>

660
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,940
<font color="yellow">isn't a good one at all.</font>

661
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,870
<font color="yellow">I should have called you Sam Soon.</font>

662
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,610
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

663
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,840
<font color="yellow">maybe you wouldn't have had this horrible illness.</font>

664
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

665
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,370
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Geum Bi.</font>

666
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,470
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

667
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,940
<font color="yellow">What? What did I do wrong?</font>

668
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,940
<font color="yellow">Can't I dance when I want to?</font>

669
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,440
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

670
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,770
<font color="yellow">Your daughter's the reason you aren't in a cell.</font>

671
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,040
<font color="yellow">Why should I be locked up for going to a club?</font>

672
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,110
<font color="yellow">That's just nonsense.</font>

673
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:26,910
<font color="yellow">That hurt.</font>

674
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,010
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, can you get Mom some water?</font>

675
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,570
<font color="yellow">I'm so thirsty.</font>

676
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,740
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

677
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,440
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

678
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,840
<font color="yellow">He isn't your dad.</font>

679
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,910
<font color="yellow">You're such a mess.</font>

680
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
<font color="yellow">You can go.</font>

681
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,070
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

682
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,440
<font color="yellow">Where's the water?</font>

683
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,010
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you pick up?</font>

684
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,170
<font color="yellow">You should've told me where you'd be.</font>

685
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

686
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,740
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

687
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,040
<font color="yellow">Where were you? We were so worried.</font>

688
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,270
<font color="yellow">Why don't you listen?</font>

689
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you shouting? You're so noisy.</font>

690
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,270
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

691
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:04,870
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

692
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,070
<font color="yellow">Do you think glaring will make you shoot lasers?</font>

693
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,210
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Why you...</font>

694
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,940
<font color="yellow">That brat.</font>

695
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,140
<font color="yellow">Hugging trees.</font>

696
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,940
<font color="yellow">She wasn't just disorderly. She fought a policeman.</font>

697
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,870
<font color="yellow">Obstruction of justice.</font>

698
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,510
<font color="yellow">She slipped up just when we needed her to.</font>

699
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,170
<font color="yellow">Will she lose her parental rights?</font>

700
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,810
<font color="yellow">Trying to take a child into a club is no small issue.</font>

701
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,940
<font color="yellow">If we're lucky...</font>

702
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,740
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Sir.</font>

703
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,340
<font color="yellow">- What? - I have...</font>

704
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,940
<font color="yellow">something important to do today.</font>

705
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,170
<font color="yellow">My insides hurt, too.</font>

706
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,570
<font color="yellow">Can you order me some soup?</font>

707
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:10,570
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

708
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,910
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

709
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,040
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

710
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:27,340
<font color="yellow">Based on what we've discussed so far...</font>

711
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,970
<font color="yellow">and the information that was given,</font>

712
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,610
<font color="yellow">I have serious doubts as to whether you should...</font>

713
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,010
<font color="yellow">keep your parental rights.</font>

714
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,270
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

715
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:49,240
<font color="yellow">you, the child's mother, seem to show remorse,</font>

716
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,910
<font color="yellow">the child is still young,</font>

717
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,770
<font color="yellow">and...</font>

718
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:58,770
<font color="yellow">our society values maternal love and instinct highly.</font>

719
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,940
<font color="yellow">I will make my decision after speaking with the child.</font>

720
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,070
<font color="yellow">You have a good taste in fashion.</font>

721
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:40,410
<font color="yellow">Try them on.</font>

722
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,670
<font color="yellow">Why? Don't you like them?</font>

723
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,170
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

724
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,340
<font color="yellow">I like them.</font>

725
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,210
<font color="yellow">Where did you get the money for this?</font>

726
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:04,210
<font color="yellow">I earned enough by reading fortunes.</font>

727
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,740
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

728
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,470
<font color="yellow">It's your hard-earned money.</font>

729
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,470
<font color="yellow">Consider it accepted.</font>

730
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,340
<font color="yellow">Let's get a refund tomorrow.</font>

731
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,670
<font color="yellow">Just say you don't like them.</font>

732
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,970
<font color="yellow">I'll throw them out.</font>

733
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:23,110
<font color="yellow">Don't do that. I'll wear them.</font>

734
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>
