<font color="yellow"><i>[FINAL EPISODE]</i></font>

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,660
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's mom.</font>

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,690
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,600
<font color="yellow">Someone sent a donation to my account.</font>

5
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,870
<font color="yellow">That person knew that my circumstances
weren't so good at the hospital.</font>

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,520
<font color="yellow">Was that you, by any chance?</font>

7
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,800
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,690
<font color="yellow">How would I be able
to afford such a thing?</font>

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,220
<font color="yellow">Then who?</font>

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,370
<font color="yellow">I don't know who it was,
but I'm grateful to that person.</font>

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,630
<font color="yellow">You can be grateful later.
Take a look at this.</font>

12
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,530
<font color="yellow">Niemann-Pick causes severe inflammation</font>

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,550
<font color="yellow">in the cerebral cortex
and the cerebellum.</font>

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,030
<font color="yellow">In order to treat the
cerebral cortex and cerebellum</font>

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,300
<font color="yellow">what would you look at?</font>

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,630
<font color="yellow">I would look at the nerve cells attached
to the cerebral cortex and cerebellum.</font>

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,050
<font color="yellow">Thalamus.</font>

18
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,670
<font color="yellow">The thalamus connects to the
cerebral cortex and the cerebellum.</font>

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,550
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,730
<font color="yellow">You found something important, right?</font>

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,460
<font color="yellow">I think we have.</font>

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,110
<font color="yellow">Let's split the mice up
into two groups and test this.</font>

23
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,270
<font color="yellow">You handle the mice that
have been fed the drugs.</font>

24
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,440
<font color="yellow">I'll handle the mice that have been
treated with the thalamus gene.</font>

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,600
<font color="yellow">Let's get on it quickly.</font>

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,750
<font color="yellow">If this works out...</font>

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,760
<font color="yellow">we could run clinical trials
within five years.</font>

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,420
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Geum Bi's Mom?</font>

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,430
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

30
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,520
<font color="yellow">You should split up the mice.</font>

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,050
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

32
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,860
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you asleep?</font>

33
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,830
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

34
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,030
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,240
<font color="yellow">I feel like I know all these people.</font>

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,670
<font color="yellow">But I don't remember them at all.</font>

37
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,030
<font color="yellow">Sometimes...</font>

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,090
<font color="yellow">the memories can come and go.</font>

39
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,630
<font color="yellow">I really wish I could remember.</font>

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,870
<font color="yellow">I think they were people I liked.</font>

41
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,600
<font color="yellow">Pick anyone you want.</font>

42
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,910
<font color="yellow">I'll bring that person to you right away.</font>

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,480
<font color="yellow">What good is that?</font>

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,160
<font color="yellow">I won't know who it is
even if I see the person.</font>

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,820
<font color="yellow">Later, I worry I might not
remember you or Mom.</font>

46
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,570
<font color="yellow">I get scared and I cry too.</font>

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,710
<font color="yellow">That's how I feel.</font>

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,490
<font color="yellow">Have I already forgotten you before?</font>

49
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,460
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep.</font>

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,320
<font color="yellow">You'll remember everything
once you wake up.</font>

52
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,560
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

53
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,090
<font color="yellow">Who is she that she's
been there this whole time?</font>

54
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,830
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

55
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,970
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's dad!</font>

56
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,970
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, I have good news.</font>

57
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,350
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

58
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,200
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

59
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,320
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,460
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

61
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,180
<font color="yellow">Why are you playing strange pranks?</font>

62
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,660
<font color="yellow">It's not funny.</font>

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,220
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

64
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,790
<font color="yellow">A girl I don't know is in our house.</font>

65
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,120
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, take a good look.</font>

66
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,020
<font color="yellow">You don't know who this is?</font>

67
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,440
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes properly
and take a good look.</font>

68
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,780
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this?</font>

69
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,330
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

70
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,020
<font color="yellow">I said I don't know her.</font>

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,660
<font color="yellow">Take another good look.</font>

72
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,000
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

73
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,490
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

74
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,240
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

75
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,870
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, where?</font>

76
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,120
<font color="yellow">This is your house.</font>

77
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,120
<font color="yellow">Who are you, Mister?</font>

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,150
<font color="yellow">Who are you, Lady?</font>

79
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,580
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, please get it together.</font>

80
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,960
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

81
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,240
<font color="yellow">- Geum Bi.
- I said, who is she?</font>

82
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,020
<font color="yellow">- Geum Bi.
- Who is she?</font>

83
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,180
<font color="yellow">- Geum Bi.
- Who is she!</font>

84
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,430
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

85
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,910
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Geum Bi.</font>

86
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,030
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

87
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,890
<font color="yellow">- Geum Bi!
- Who are you?</font>

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,370
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, please focus.</font>

89
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,960
<font color="yellow">- Geum Bi, Geum Bi.
- Let me go!</font>

90
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,740
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, wake up!</font>

91
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,260
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, Geum Bi!</font>

92
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,220
<font color="yellow">Wake up, Geum Bi!</font>

93
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,470
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, Geum Bi!</font>

94
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,180
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

95
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,290
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

96
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,010
<font color="yellow">If her cognitive level has decreased
so that she doesn't recognize herself...</font>

97
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,090
<font color="yellow">she is at a critical stage now.</font>

98
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,540
<font color="yellow">How can she suddenly
be in critical stage now?</font>

99
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,010
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi will be in a great deal
of physical discomfort.</font>

100
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,030
<font color="yellow">Rather than focusing on her memories</font>

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,420
<font color="yellow">you need to focus on
her physical well-being.</font>

102
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,670
<font color="yellow">Then what about Geum Bi?</font>

103
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,800
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even know who she is
and only her body will be left.</font>

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,150
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

105
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,500
<font color="yellow">We wanted to help Geum Bi
get through this without hardship.</font>

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,450
<font color="yellow">That was our job.</font>

107
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,330
<font color="yellow">This is the same thing.</font>

108
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,260
<font color="yellow">How is this the same thing?
Her memories will be gone.</font>

109
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,680
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi will disappear.</font>

110
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,090
<font color="yellow">Why would our Geum Bi disappear?</font>

111
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,960
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even know her own face,
so how is that our Geum Bi?</font>

112
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,560
<font color="yellow">Whether she has her memories or not,
Geum Bi is still Geum Bi.</font>

113
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,420
<font color="yellow">We are Geum Bi's mom and dad.</font>

114
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,940
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi told me that
she wants to remember.</font>

115
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,850
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't anyone believe me?</font>

116
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,460
<font color="yellow">She has lost more of her brain matter.</font>

117
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,080
<font color="yellow">It is getting quite severe.</font>

118
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,350
<font color="yellow">We need to work quickly.</font>

119
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,600
<font color="yellow">If things don't work out,
the treatments will all be useless.</font>

120
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,490
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, can you close
and open your hand for me?</font>

121
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,270
<font color="yellow">Can you move your index finger for me?</font>

122
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,650
<font color="yellow">Now, how about your thumb?</font>

123
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,740
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

124
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,960
<font color="yellow">I can't even recognize myself.</font>

125
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Your trip is coming to an end.</i></font>

126
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,360
<font color="yellow"><i>You will live here now and
only watch over them once in a while.</i></font>

127
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,560
<font color="yellow">From here? By myself?</font>

128
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,070
<font color="yellow"><i>You have all your memories
from the trip you took there.</i></font>

129
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,570
<font color="yellow">Can't I stay on my trip a little longer?</font>

130
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,640
<font color="yellow">I can only meet my dad
if I leave this place.</font>

131
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,000
<font color="yellow"><i>No, you can't.</i></font>

132
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,760
<font color="yellow"><i>It's hard for you to even breathe.</i></font>

133
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,290
<font color="yellow"><i>You may not realize this</i></font>

134
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,230
<font color="yellow"><i>but this place is a protective
shield you've made for yourself.</i></font>

135
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,190
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave.</font>

136
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,000
<font color="yellow"><i>No... you can't.</i></font>

137
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,390
<font color="yellow">I left so many things unsaid to my dad.</font>

138
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,600
<font color="yellow">I haven't even told him
how much I like him.</font>

139
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,300
<font color="yellow"><i>You'll die though.</i></font>

140
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,400
<font color="yellow">Then I'd rather die.</font>

141
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,110
<font color="yellow">If I don't know who I am,
I'm not even myself.</font>

142
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,890
<font color="yellow">I'm going to find a way out and leave.</font>

143
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,520
<font color="yellow">You'll help me, won't you?</font>

144
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,530
<font color="yellow"><i>You really shouldn't.</i></font>

145
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,040
<font color="yellow"><i>It's dangerous to go any further!</i></font>

146
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,800
<font color="yellow"><i>You and I will die if you keep going!</i></font>

147
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,540
<font color="yellow"><i>Geum Bi!</i></font>

148
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Court, prison...</i></font>

149
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,410
<font color="yellow"><i>Han River Park.</i></font>

150
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Hotel buffet.</i></font>

151
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,890
<font color="yellow"><i>Campground.</i></font>

152
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,850
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.
How many days has it been now?</font>

153
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,410
<font color="yellow">You already flew a kite at

157
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,630
<font color="yellow">You like your ramen chewy
and slightly cooked?</font>

158
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,550
<font color="yellow">Then why do you cook it at all?
Why not eat it raw?</font>

159
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,990
<font color="yellow">It ought to be cooked just right
with the noodles thick.</font>

160
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,350
<font color="yellow">The broth needs to be boiled down
for the ramen to taste right.</font>

<font color="yellow">Gosh! Hey, look at this.</font>

163
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,530
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

164
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,570
<font color="yellow">Why didn't the lipid level
decrease in the thalamus group?</font>

165
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,960
<font color="yellow">The therapy gene did not
affect the inflammation.</font>

166
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,970
<font color="yellow">Your hypothesis about the
thalamus nerve was incorrect.</font>

167
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,350
<font color="yellow">No, that can't be possible.</font>

168

170
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,970

305
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,050
<font color="yellow">Try another place.</font>

306
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,990
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi nearly died but
came back three days ago.</font>

307
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,280
<font color="yellow">She's having trouble breathing
due to muscular deterioration.</font>

308
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,550
<font color="yellow">She went into cardiac arrest
and barely managed to survive.</font>

309
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,260
<font color="yellow">They attached a breathing
machine to her small body.</font>

310
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,640
<font color="yellow">She survived by getting
shocks from a defibrillator.</font>

311
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,170
<font color="yellow">Why do you think she held on?</font>

312
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,300
<font color="yellow">It would have been easier for her to go.</font>

313
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,380
<font color="yellow">Because she wanted to live.</font>

314
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,670
<font color="yellow">She's telling us she wants to live
with all the strength she has left.</font>

315
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,280
<font color="yellow">Are you going to ignore that?</font>

316
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,550
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can do.</font>

317
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,750
<font color="yellow">It's not that you want to give up
because you're tired?</font>

318
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,870
<font color="yellow">You can see right through me.
You scare me.</font>

319
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:23,000
<font color="yellow">I'm a mother who just saw my child
nearly die right in front of me.</font>

320
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,330
<font color="yellow">How could I not be scary?</font>

321
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,500
<font color="yellow">What should I do then?</font>

322
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,020
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

323
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,520
<font color="yellow">Get up and keep doing
what you have been doing.</font>

324
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,440
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

325
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,950
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

326
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, I should.</font>

327
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,000
<font color="yellow">How far did I get yesterday?</font>

328
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
<font color="yellow">- Geum Bi.
- Geum Bi.</font>

329
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,380
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

330
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,720
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

331
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,400
<font color="yellow">It's... it's Dad.</font>

332
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,390
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

333
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,610
<font color="yellow">Dad...</font>

334
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,930
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

335
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,230
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

336
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,160
<font color="yellow">It's Mom. Can you recognize me?</font>

337
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,740
<font color="yellow">You recognize me?</font>

338
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

339
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,070
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd come back.</font>

340
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,340
<font color="yellow">Little Miss Geum Bi,
I knew you'd come back.</font>

341
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,210
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

342
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,990
<font color="yellow">Yes, Geum Bi?</font>

343
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,420
<font color="yellow">I met my aunt.</font>

344
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,040
<font color="yellow">Aunt?</font>

345
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,670
<font color="yellow">Joon Hui?</font>

346
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,680
<font color="yellow">She wanted me to give you a message.</font>

347
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:52,250
<font color="yellow">She says she's doing fine,
so she wants you to live happily.</font>

348
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:09,390
<font color="yellow">But... I only have one day here.</font>

349
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,250
<font color="yellow">One day?</font>

350
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,400
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

351
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,190
<font color="yellow">Aunt Joon Hui said that
once I fall asleep at night...</font>

352
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,490
<font color="yellow">I have to go back.</font>

353
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,570
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

354
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,130
<font color="yellow">Then what should we do first?</font>

355
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,610
<font color="yellow">Anything...</font>

356
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,990
<font color="yellow">with Mom and Dad.</font>

357
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,330
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Okay.</font>

358
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,400
<font color="yellow">Today, I'll do whatever it is you want.</font>

359
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,800
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

360
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,000
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

361
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,710
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

362
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,010
<font color="yellow">We love you!</font>

363
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,270
<font color="yellow">What took you so long to come?
We waited for you?</font>

364
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,580
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the sea
together again, Geum Bi.</font>

365
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,950
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, look behind you.</font>

366
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,260
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

367
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,930
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

368
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,040
<font color="yellow">Where did you go off to?</font>

369
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,050
<font color="yellow">You didn't say anything before leaving.</font>

370
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,630
<font color="yellow">You little thing.</font>

371
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,830
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

372
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,460
<font color="yellow">How could this be?</font>

373
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,790
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, I'm happy to see you again.</font>

374
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,900
<font color="yellow">Doctors.</font>

375
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,220
<font color="yellow">You'll fix me, won't you?</font>

376
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,090
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

377
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,660
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

378
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,560
<font color="yellow">If I can't fix you,
your mom won't let me live.</font>

379
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,820
<font color="yellow">If I continue to live,
you can use me in clinical trials.</font>

380
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,720
<font color="yellow">It could be dangerous.</font>

381
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,960
<font color="yellow">It would take time, too.</font>

382
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,800
<font color="yellow">Please do it.</font>

383
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,690
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

384
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,600
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

385
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,440
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, should we get going now?</font>

386
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:46,270
<font color="yellow">Is this what they call a miracle
or something like that?</font>

387
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,680
<font color="yellow">Still, we are scientists,
so we should look at the evidence.</font>

388
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,180
<font color="yellow">Let's take a look at the MRI
Geum Bi took when she woke up.</font>

389
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,420
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

390
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,430
<font color="yellow">I like it chewy and slightly cooked.</font>

391
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,510
<font color="yellow">It needs to cooked more.</font>

392
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,650
<font color="yellow">Dad had me sit here and
he knocked the pot over on purpose.</font>

393
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,630
<font color="yellow">I saw the whole thing.</font>

394
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,720
<font color="yellow">It was the only ramen we had.</font>

395
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,540
<font color="yellow">What a waste that was.</font>

396
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,350
<font color="yellow">You... that was your fault.</font>

397
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,870
<font color="yellow">Chewy noodles.</font>

398
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,540
<font color="yellow">It needs to be cooked and softer.</font>

399
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,860
<font color="yellow">Chewy!</font>

400
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,530
<font color="yellow">Stop fighting, you two.</font>

401
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,520
<font color="yellow">I'll tip this pot over.</font>

402
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,730
<font color="yellow">- No.
- You can't!</font>

403
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,240
<font color="yellow">Still, the noodles should be cooked more.</font>

404
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,660
<font color="yellow">It's all your fault, Dad.</font>

405
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:46,880
<font color="yellow">Ramen ought to be cooked well
or it's better to eat it raw.</font>

406
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,160
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

407
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,290
<font color="yellow">If I were born again</font>

408
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,530
<font color="yellow">you would be my dad again, right?</font>

409
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,590
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

410
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,580
<font color="yellow">Why? Were you going to
look for a different dad?</font>

411
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,290
<font color="yellow">That's good, then.</font>

412
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,240
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

413
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,770
<font color="yellow">Hwi Chul.</font>

414
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,290
<font color="yellow">I love you both.</font>

415
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,860
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

416
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,410
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy.</font>

417
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,970
<font color="yellow">Sleep if you're tired.</font>

418
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,290
<font color="yellow">Mom and Dad will be by your side.</font>

419
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,360
<font color="yellow">Tell me a story.</font>

420
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,510
<font color="yellow">What story?</font>

421
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,360
<font color="yellow">The story of when we first met and
everything that happened until today.</font>

422
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,010
<font color="yellow">Dad had been going around,
doing some bad things.</font>

423
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,300
<font color="yellow">It looked like I would
be going to prison.</font>

424
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,790
<font color="yellow">You showed up out of nowhere.</font>

425
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,320
<font color="yellow">At first, you were so strange to me.</font>

426
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,100
<font color="yellow">I thought to myself,
what kind of child is this?</font>

427
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,610
<font color="yellow">Then your mom and I made
a promise to marry each other.</font>

428
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,820
<font color="yellow">You officiated the ceremony, Geum Bi.</font>

429
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,920
<font color="yellow">Suddenly, you told us to kiss.</font>

430
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,540
<font color="yellow">It was so embarrassing.</font>

431
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,420
<font color="yellow">Then your mom came at me like a wolf.</font>

432
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,290
<font color="yellow">And then...</font>

433
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,740
<font color="yellow">Then you...</font>

434
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,640
<font color="yellow">you asked us to give you a younger
sibling that would take after you.</font>

435
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,640
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

436
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,560
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep.</font>

437
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,520
<font color="yellow">You should sleep now.</font>

438
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,860
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to recognize
either of you from now on.</font>

439
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,110
<font color="yellow">No matter where you are...</font>

440
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,420
<font color="yellow">No matter what you're doing and where...</font>

441
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,660
<font color="yellow">Whether you are here or not...</font>

442
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,100
<font color="yellow">To Mom and Dad...</font>

443
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,330
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, you are just Geum Bi.</font>

444
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,630
<font color="yellow">Life or death...</font>

445
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,080
<font color="yellow">the three of us together.</font>

446
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:07,780
<font color="yellow">You know that, right?</font>

447
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,070
<font color="yellow">Life or death,
the three of us together.</font>

448
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,970
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, you're tired now,
so go to sleep.</font>

449
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,130
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

450
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,090
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

451
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,110
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

452
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,170
<font color="yellow">Even if I'm not here...</font>

453
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,580
<font color="yellow">you two have to be happy together.</font>

454
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,320
<font color="yellow">Don't fight with each other.</font>

455
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,530
<font color="yellow">Also, I have a wish.</font>

456
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,200
<font color="yellow">Tell us.</font>

457
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:09,580
<font color="yellow">Dad will get you the moon and stars
if that's what you want.</font>

458
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,880
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

459
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,820
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

460
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,420
<font color="yellow">Dad?</font>

461
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, Geum Bi.</font>

462
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,350
<font color="yellow">Dad, you are my dad, right?</font>

463
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,630
<font color="yellow">Of course, I am.</font>

464
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,730
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

465
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,970
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi?</font>

466
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,830
<font color="yellow">Our child.</font>

467
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,550
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're here.</font>

468
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:25,070
<font color="yellow">By the way, you've been depositing
the donation to Geum Bi's doctor, right?</font>

469
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,810
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about such things.</font>

470
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,210
<font color="yellow">We're even making donations
for the benefit of others now.</font>

471
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,880
<font color="yellow">Who knew this day would come?</font>

472
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:40,460
<font color="yellow">If Geum Bi would get all better</font>

473
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,050
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't wish for anything more
and it'd be a good world.</font>

474
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,720
<font color="yellow">Do well with the interview.</font>

475
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,680
<font color="yellow">Don't ruin this beautiful world.</font>

476
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,740
<font color="yellow">A person like me doing an interview?</font>

477
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,270
<font color="yellow">I feel a little shy.</font>

478
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,270
<font color="yellow">He's here for the interview.</font>

479
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:59,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that right?
Please sit for a moment.</font>

480
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:07,720
<font color="yellow">People will be in line to buy limited
edition sneakers if you go here.</font>

481
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,640
<font color="yellow">You need to go here and stand in line.</font>

482
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,560
<font color="yellow">When the client shows up,
give the spot to the client and leave.</font>

483
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,140
<font color="yellow">Can you do that?</font>

484
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,340
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

485
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:19,130
<font color="yellow">You can't let people
butt in front of you.</font>

486
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,930
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
- Okay.</font>

487
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,970
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

488
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,690
<font color="yellow">What do you do here?</font>

489
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,080
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
It's a place of business.</font>

490
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,950
<font color="yellow">In a legal and law-abiding manner.</font>

491
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,160
<font color="yellow">Is it a place where you hire people
like that, pay crap, and overwork them?</font>

492
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,840
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a thing?</font>

493
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,600
<font color="yellow">It's suspicious that you only
hire ex-convicts and the disabled.</font>

494
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,850
<font color="yellow">We are open to hiring
ex-convicts and the disabled.</font>

495
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,200
<font color="yellow">We do not discriminate.</font>

496
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,860
<font color="yellow">It's quite obvious to me what this is.</font>

497
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,700
<font color="yellow">You pretend to care about society on
the surface while sucking people dry.</font>

498
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,710
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

499
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:06,980
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to work here,
please leave quietly.</font>

500
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,900
<font color="yellow">Please do not ruin this beautiful day.</font>

501
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,560
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're con artists.</font>

502
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,760
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

503
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,220
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry you got the wrong idea.</font>

504
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,980
<font color="yellow">We stopped running scams long ago.</font>

505
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,400
<font color="yellow">What a joke.</font>

506
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,700
<font color="yellow">Can a leopard change its spots?</font>

507
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,620
<font color="yellow">It can.</font>

508
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,030
<font color="yellow">We can help you do it, too.</font>

509
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,270
<font color="yellow">Are you insulting me?</font>

510
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,070
<font color="yellow">You can sit down and listen
or you can leave.</font>

511
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,480
<font color="yellow">You'll never forget it if you
take a beating in front of this woman.</font>

512
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,770
<font color="yellow">What should I do, Min Ah?
I'll do what you tell me to.</font>

513
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,290
<font color="yellow">Why did you let him hit you?
I told you to hit him.</font>

514
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,420
<font color="yellow">You said to hold myself back.</font>

515
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,430
<font color="yellow">When did I do that?</font>

516
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:13,110
<font color="yellow">You told me to hold back
with your facial expression.</font>

517
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,720
<font color="yellow">No, that was me telling you to hit him.</font>

518
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,940
<font color="yellow">Oh, that stings.</font>

519
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,840
<font color="yellow">That was you telling me to hit him?</font>

520
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,990
<font color="yellow">You're no match for her.
You should give up on Chi Soo.</font>

521
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,840
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

522
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,810
<font color="yellow">Do you have to say that
and make me feel bad about it?</font>

523
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,580
<font color="yellow">What is it that happened
in Geum Bi's head?</font>

524
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,020
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

525
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,230
<font color="yellow">I think I figured something out.</font>

526
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,080
<font color="yellow">I think I did too.</font>

527
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,400
<font color="yellow">Should we both say it?</font>

528
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,520
<font color="yellow">Sounds good.</font>

529
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:14,840
<font color="yellow">Inflammation?</font>

530
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,600
<font color="yellow">What about the inflammation?</font>

531
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,450
<font color="yellow">We have to treat that first.</font>

532
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,710
<font color="yellow">And then?</font>

533
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,960
<font color="yellow">We have to remove that first
and then go after the thalamus.</font>

534
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,120
<font color="yellow">It's so simple.</font>

535
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,750
<font color="yellow">Why didn't we think of it before?</font>

536
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,420
<font color="yellow">Let's start again.</font>

537
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,850
<font color="yellow">Our Geum Bi didn't leave us.</font>

538
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,390
<font color="yellow">She looks like a baby in a mother's womb.</font>

539
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,170
<font color="yellow">She does.</font>

540
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:28,720
<font color="yellow">Would we be wronging Geum Bi if
she ended up with a younger sibling?</font>

541
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,110
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi said she
wanted a younger sibling.</font>

542
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,090
<font color="yellow">What if I grew apart from Geum Bi
after a baby came?</font>

543
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,810
<font color="yellow">The Go Kang Hee that I know
is not that kind of woman.</font>

544
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,170
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

545
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,670
<font color="yellow">Hi! Jae Ha, Shil La.</font>

546
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:10,090
<font color="yellow">Wow, you two!</font>

547
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,640
<font color="yellow">How did the time go by so fast?</font>

548
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,250
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

549
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,660
<font color="yellow">Are you happy being back with
the wife that you divorced before?</font>

550
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:25,030
<font color="yellow">Happy? I'm dying from all her nagging.</font>

551
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,940
<font color="yellow">Is your husband still not working?</font>

552
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,470
<font color="yellow">Damn it. What can I do? That's my life.</font>

553
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,650
<font color="yellow">By the way, that kid grew up so much.</font>

554
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,510
<font color="yellow">Wow. You can really see his facial
features starting to form now.</font>

555
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,840
<font color="yellow">Does he look like his mom?</font>

556
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,680
<font color="yellow">Many people say that.</font>

557
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,950
<font color="yellow">If you look at him carefully,
he has some of his dad's features.</font>

558
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,970
<font color="yellow">You don't want him to look like his dad.</font>

559
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:50,020
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

560
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,530
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to be a dad?</font>

561
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:54,250
<font color="yellow">It's like you said.</font>

562
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,500
<font color="yellow">Did I say something?</font>

563
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,300
<font color="yellow">It's warm and feels like
there's a big egg in my heart.</font>

564
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,620
<font color="yellow">I said something like that?</font>

565
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,190
<font color="yellow">Never mind. I guess I heard it elsewhere.</font>

566
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,550
<font color="yellow">I said some good words to you.</font>

567
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,160
<font color="yellow">Oh! Here she comes.</font>

568
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's Geum Bi.</font>

569
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,780
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

570
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,020
<font color="yellow"><i>[MO GEUM BI]</i></font>

571
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,960
<font color="yellow">Have you been doing well, Geum Bi?</font>

572
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,820
<font color="yellow">You look happy today.</font>

573
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,160
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, I brought you a present.</font>

574
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,340
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

575
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,040
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, we were able to
have a 17th birthday party.</font>

576
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,680
<font color="yellow">I am more thankful.</font>

577
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,110
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Geum Bi,
we made a lot of progress in research.</font>

578
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:56,130
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll take a picture now.
Everyone gather around.</font>

579
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,030
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's get together.</font>

580
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,340
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

581
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,140
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

582
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,990
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's mom.</font>

583
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,550
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's mom.</font>

584
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,700
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Geum Bi's dad.</font>

585
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,120
<font color="yellow">No need to thank me.</font>

586
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,060
<font color="yellow">Why do you say that every time you come?</font>

587
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,160
<font color="yellow">It's unnecessary.</font>

588
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,430
<font color="yellow">Here, I will take the picture.</font>

589
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,250
<font color="yellow">Go stand there.</font>

590
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,590
<font color="yellow">If I am still alive
on my 17th birthday...</font>

591
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,740
<font color="yellow">dress me in pretty clothes.</font>

592
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:38,040
<font color="yellow">Make my hair look pretty.</font>

593
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,840
<font color="yellow">Then I want to take
a picture with you, Dad.</font>

594
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,420
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

595
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,150
<font color="yellow">Look this way.</font>

596
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,950
<font color="yellow">One, two...</font>
