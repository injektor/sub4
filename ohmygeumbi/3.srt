00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying so much in the middle of the night?</font>

6
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,300
<font color="yellow">Stop crying.</font>

7
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,060
<font color="yellow">People may think I'm dying.</font>

8
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,430
<font color="yellow">Will you die?</font>

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,360
<font color="yellow">Of course, I will.</font>

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,260
<font color="yellow">Not now, though.</font>

11
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,330
<font color="yellow">I'll die in 50 years.</font>

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,660
<font color="yellow">You'll probably be 60 by then.</font>

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,960
<font color="yellow">You'll be an old witch.</font>

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,900
<font color="yellow">What? Do you want me to die soon?</font>

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,500
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you die or live.</font>

16
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,660
<font color="yellow">You are so ungrateful.</font>

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,460
<font color="yellow">What did the doctor say? Are you hurt?</font>

18
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,060
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you to save me.</font>

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're right.</font>

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,430
<font color="yellow">You never said that.</font>

21
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,560
<font color="yellow">I should have left you.</font>

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,930
<font color="yellow">You're so ugly.</font>

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,530
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop. My head hurts.</font>

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,400
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- Stop. He has a concussion.</font>

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,500
<font color="yellow">- A concussion?
- Yes.</font>

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,630
<font color="yellow">It's nothing serious, but you'll feel nauseous.</font>

28
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,300
<font color="yellow">You also sprained your neck. Please don't move.</font>

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,130
<font color="yellow">The doctor will be here soon.</font>

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,700
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,800
<font color="yellow">I have a concussion and a sprained neck.</font>

32
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,430
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

33
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,530
<font color="yellow">I don't think you should get angry right now.</font>

34
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,260
<font color="yellow">Just you wait until I get better.</font>

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,830
<font color="yellow">I'll tie you from the ceiling and...</font>

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,600
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee.</font>

37
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,660
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

38
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,900
<font color="yellow">Did you call her?</font>

39
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,730
<font color="yellow">Who else would I call?</font>

40
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,000
<font color="yellow">I couldn't call those con artists.</font>

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth.</font>

42
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,630
<font color="yellow">What will you do now?</font>

43
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,630
<font color="yellow">She got me into an accident and now this.</font>

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,130
<font color="yellow">It's getting colder. What will you do with...</font>

45
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,100
<font color="yellow">How dare you jump in front of a truck?</font>

46
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,430
<font color="yellow">I didn't jump.</font>

47
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,500
<font color="yellow">The truck came out from nowhere.</font>

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,200
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi needs a CT scan.</font>

49
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,330
<font color="yellow">A CT scan?</font>

50
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,800
<font color="yellow">You don't know, do you?</font>

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,930
<font color="yellow">That really hurts.</font>

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,530
<font color="yellow">I won't do it.</font>

53
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,130
<font color="yellow">I found this in her stomach area.</font>

54
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,000
<font color="yellow">Her liver and spleen are swollen up.</font>

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,330
<font color="yellow">There is a possibility that it's a metabolic disease...</font>

56
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,460
<font color="yellow">or leukemia.</font>

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,860
<font color="yellow">Leukemia?</font>

58
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,300
<font color="yellow">No, we did a CT scan and a blood test.</font>

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,860
<font color="yellow">She seems to be fine.</font>

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,130
<font color="yellow">You shocked me.</font>

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
<font color="yellow">But we should do a biopsy.</font>

62
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,230
<font color="yellow">I thought she was fine.</font>

63
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,930
<font color="yellow">That's according to the CT scan and the blood test.</font>

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,660
<font color="yellow">Then why?</font>

65
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,730
<font color="yellow">I am concerned about her swollen liver and spleen.</font>

66
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,730
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure about her spleen,</font>

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,460
<font color="yellow">but she already acts like she has a huge liver.</font>

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,730
<font color="yellow">If you sign this consent,</font>

69
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,460
<font color="yellow">we'll conduct the biopsy right away.</font>

70
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,300
<font color="yellow">- May I use the pen?
- Sure.</font>

72
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,200
<font color="yellow">I hope you're not ripping us off.</font>

73
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, kid!</font>

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,830
<font color="yellow">Why is she so fast?</font>

75
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,460
<font color="yellow">- What's her name?
- Yoo Geum Bi.</font>

76
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,930
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

77
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,200
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi!</font>

78
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,930
<font color="yellow">Yoo Geum Bi?</font>

79
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,330
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

80
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,300
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, you have to do this.</font>

81
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,960
<font color="yellow">I said, no.</font>

82
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,230
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

83
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,000
<font color="yellow">You have to get a checkup.</font>

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,860
<font color="yellow">Never.</font>

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,730
<font color="yellow">It won't hurt that much.</font>

86
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,100
<font color="yellow">They are all lying. I know that.</font>

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
<font color="yellow">How do you know?</font>

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,730
<font color="yellow">I just know.</font>

89
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,300
<font color="yellow">Your dad has some business to take care of.</font>

90
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,960
<font color="yellow">Why don't you come back to my house with me?</font>

91
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,770
<font color="yellow">The door is opening.</font>

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to come along?</font>

93
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,460
<font color="yellow">I do. But...</font>

94
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,300
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

95
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,030
<font color="yellow">Okay. I understand.</font>

99
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,030

100
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,900
<font color="yellow">Then why are you so persistent?</font>

101
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,460
<font color="yellow">I want to ask you the same question.</font>

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,630
<font color="yellow">You're being so persistent about having...</font>

<font color="yellow">two strangers in your house.</font>

104

106

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,760

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,760
<font color="yellow">You're already here. Why?</font>

109
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,800
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,430
<font color="yellow">You haven't looked at me once since yesterday.</font>

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,200
<font color="yellow">Look into my eyes.</font>

112
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,200
<font color="yellow">I only look at pretty women.</font>

113
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,860
<font color="yellow">Then why did you draw the ugly woman's face?</font>

114
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,530
<font color="yellow">My goodness, forget about it.</font>

115
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,230

116
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
<font color="yellow">I never said you were ugly.</font>

117
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,730
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring juice?</font>

118
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,230
<font color="yellow">You should've brought soju.</font>

119
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,300
<font color="yellow">Did Chi Soo call you again?</font>

120
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,000
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you feel nauseous?</font>

121
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,500
<font color="yellow">I'm running away tonight.</font>

122
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,800
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

123
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,760
<font color="yellow">A concussion is a serious medical condition.</font>

124
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,200

125
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,800
<font color="yellow">It looks like she'll take care of her for a while.</font>

126
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the kid won't tell the police.</font>

127
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,560
<font color="yellow">And if she forgets me, it's all for the best.</font>

128
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,800
<font color="yellow">Who's she?</font>

129
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,700
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee?</font>

130
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,130
<font color="yellow">You should go with her. Don't run away.</font>

131
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,330
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to betray us...</font>

132
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
<font color="yellow">because you're smitten by her?</font>

133
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,360
<font color="yellow">Did I ever ruin anything because of a woman?</font>

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,760
<font color="yellow">Then just go to her house!</font>

135
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,760
<font color="yellow">Seize your opportunity while you have a chance.</font>

136
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,360
<font color="yellow">Darn it. I'm just saying.</font>

137
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,900
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get involved with her.</font>

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,130
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- I don't know. Just because.</font>

139
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,400
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving this planet. Don't look for me.</font>

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,960
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth, you idiot.</font>

141
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,700
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you asleep?</font>

142
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,260
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

143
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

144
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,330
<font color="yellow">I'm just getting some air.</font>

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,730
<font color="yellow">The nurse told you not to move.</font>

146
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,900
<font color="yellow">Nonsense. How can I not move around?</font>

147
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,870
<font color="yellow">Go in and sleep.</font>

148
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,530
<font color="yellow">If you were going to run away, don't get caught.</font>

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

150
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,000
<font color="yellow">That is not right. I'm not running away.</font>

151
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,130
<font color="yellow">I won't run away, so go sleep.</font>

152
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,870
<font color="yellow">Put your cast back on.</font>

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,630
<font color="yellow">You should worry about yourself.</font>

154
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,370
<font color="yellow">Don't get caught.</font>

155
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,200
<font color="yellow">I'll look out for you.</font>

156
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,960
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Don't worry.</font>

159
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,130
<font color="yellow">That you abandoned me.</font>

166
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,870

167
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,960
<font color="yellow">and an orphanage doesn't sound so bad.</font>

168

<font color="yellow">I will keep my promise.</font>

169

<font color="yellow">What promise?</font>

170
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,370
<font color="yellow">I prayed for you when you were unconscious.</font>

171
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,500
<font color="yellow">That I'll go to the orphanage if you wake up.</font>

172
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,870
<font color="yellow">So go.</font>

173
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,130
<font color="yellow">It'll be embarrassing for me if you get caught.</font>

174

175

177

178
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,700

179
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,830

188
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,330
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to go there.</font>

189
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,060
<font color="yellow">I said I'm not going.</font>

190

216
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,460
<font color="yellow">I was suspicious of you, too.</font>

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,760
<font color="yellow">we have to find ourselves a new financial.</font>

313
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,230
<font color="yellow">It takes money to plan our next move.</font>

314
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,100
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll replace it when I get the chance.</font>

315
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

316
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,660
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

317
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,930
<font color="yellow">- Get up.
- What?</font>

318
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,360
<font color="yellow">You're going right now!</font>

319
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,860
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

320
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,070
<font color="yellow">Do you have to do this?</font>

321
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

322
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,860
<font color="yellow">Jae Gyung does have a drive to get things done.</font>

323
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,930
<font color="yellow">What drive?</font>

324
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,760
<font color="yellow">What are you waiting for?</font>

325
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,460
<font color="yellow">Give me that.</font>

326
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,130
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

327
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,900
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

328
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,600
<font color="yellow">Why are you so scared?</font>

329
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,430
<font color="yellow">It's not like we did anything wrong.</font>

330
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,500
<font color="yellow">We did, you idiot.</font>

331
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,900
<font color="yellow">- Come on. Hide.
- Fine.</font>

332
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,200
<font color="yellow">- I'm going.
- Hurry.</font>

333
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,330
<font color="yellow">- Be quiet.
- My goodness.</font>

334
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,430
<font color="yellow">Duck.</font>

335
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
<font color="yellow">You're home very early.</font>

336
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,630
<font color="yellow">I came back home right after an errand.</font>

337
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,900
<font color="yellow">Are you skipping work?</font>

338
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,030
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

339
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,730
<font color="yellow">Can't an ugly person skip work?</font>

340
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,960
<font color="yellow">Of course, she can.</font>

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
<font color="yellow">And I wasn't saying that you were ugly.</font>

342
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,230
<font color="yellow">What an idiot.</font>

343
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,760
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

344
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,200
<font color="yellow">Let's eat dinner once Geum Bi gets home.</font>

345
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,860

348
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,500
<font color="yellow">It was the spring of my 15th birthday.</font>

349
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,930
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

350
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,230
<font color="yellow">You must've loved these...</font>

351
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,700
<font color="yellow">since you were a kid.</font>

352
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,830
<font color="yellow">It was actually for someone else.</font>

353
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,730
<font color="yellow">Someone else?</font>

354
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,130
<font color="yellow">I saw a bicycle in the storage...</font>

355
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,530
<font color="yellow">while cleaning the house.</font>

356
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,530
<font color="yellow">It's very rusty, isn't it?</font>

357
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,530
<font color="yellow">It seemed like a child's bicycle.</font>

358
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,830
<font color="yellow">I think we've grown closer.</font>

359
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,330
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

360
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, sure.</font>

361
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,730
<font color="yellow">But we're not close enough...</font>

362
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,460
<font color="yellow">to share our difficult pasts.</font>

363
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,030
<font color="yellow">Yes, I agree.</font>

364
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,200
<font color="yellow">I wonder why you and Geum Bi have different last names.</font>

365
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,200
<font color="yellow">But I won't ask.</font>

366
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,130
<font color="yellow">You can tell me...</font>

367
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,330
<font color="yellow">when the time is right.</font>

368
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,030
<font color="yellow">If you can't throw it out,</font>

369
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,230
<font color="yellow">take it out and polish it.</font>

370
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,060
<font color="yellow">I know I'm over the line here,</font>

371
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,600
<font color="yellow">but I think that would hurt less.</font>

372
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,400
<font color="yellow">If you don't, it'll continue to hurt you.</font>

373

- It is.</font>

375
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,330
<font color="yellow">Today, I learned...</font>

376
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,760
<font color="yellow">how babies are formed.</font>

377
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,360
<font color="yellow">Which grade are you in?</font>

378
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,100
<font color="yellow">I'm in third grade. Don't you know?</font>

379
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,260
<font color="yellow">So how are babies formed?</font>

380
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,960
<font color="yellow">I saw pictures and descriptions,</font>

381
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,060
<font color="yellow">but I'm not sure if I know.</font>

382
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,030
<font color="yellow">It's weird, though.</font>

383
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,460
<font color="yellow">I don't think babies come after holding hands.</font>

384
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,630
<font color="yellow">How was I made?</font>

385
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,500
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

386
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,760
<font color="yellow">You were made to look ugly.</font>

387
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,930
<font color="yellow">I'll explain it to you when we get home.</font>

388
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,200
<font color="yellow">You will learn in time after you grow up.</font>

389
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,860
<font color="yellow">What if I don't become an adult?</font>

390
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,700
<font color="yellow">Quick-tempered kids...</font>

391
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,300
<font color="yellow">tend to have kids early.</font>

392
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,760
<font color="yellow">Don't ever do that, okay?</font>

393
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

394
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,200

395
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600

396
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

397
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,560
<font color="yellow">- Is this a fake?
- My gosh.</font>

398
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,030
<font color="yellow">Why did you steal this?</font>

399
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,030
<font color="yellow">Darn it. Is he out of his mind?</font>

400
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,200
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

401
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,860
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

402
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,960
<font color="yellow">The weather is so nice.</font>

403
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in school today?</font>

404
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,600
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

405
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,030
<font color="yellow">You became a coward.</font>

406
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,800
<font color="yellow">You weren't like this before.</font>

407
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,760
<font color="yellow">It's been 15 years. Haven't you had enough?</font>

408
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,700
<font color="yellow">You know me.</font>

409
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,660
<font color="yellow">You can't leave me until the day you die.</font>

410
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,200
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything I can give you.</font>

411
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,730
<font color="yellow">You are scared.</font>

412
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,330
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

413
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,830
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't care if you died or lived.</font>

414
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,800
<font color="yellow">Yes. I don't care if I die or live.</font>

415
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,300
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

416
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,600
<font color="yellow">I heard you are onto something with Gil Ho.</font>

417
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,660
<font color="yellow">Wrap up everything in a week and hand it over.</font>

418
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,130
<font color="yellow">Give this to Gil Ho.</font>

419
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,830
<font color="yellow">How can you be confused?</font>

420
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,560
<font color="yellow">I told you to switch them.</font>

421
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,600
<font color="yellow">How can you give me the fake one?</font>

422
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,000
<font color="yellow">You are so stupid.</font>

423
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,100
<font color="yellow">You're such an idiot.</font>

424
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,800
<font color="yellow">What? Did Chi Soo...</font>

425
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,930
<font color="yellow">find you?</font>

426
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,330
<font color="yellow">You should stay low for a while.</font>

427
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,330
<font color="yellow">Then what about you?</font>

428
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,800
<font color="yellow">I'll stay low and see how things turn out.</font>

429
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,200
<font color="yellow">You can keep it if you'd like.</font>

430
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,660
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

431
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,900
<font color="yellow">I hope you know that we can't stay here...</font>

432
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,400
<font color="yellow">forever.</font>

433
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,700
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

434
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,230
<font color="yellow">But we can sleep in the car.</font>

435
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,260
<font color="yellow">We have that waterproof tent, too.</font>

436
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,400
<font color="yellow">It's going to be winter soon.</font>

437
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,460
<font color="yellow">You know that we can't do that.</font>

438
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,560
<font color="yellow">So what? Is this about the orphanage again?</font>

439
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,630
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

440
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,430
<font color="yellow">I find your aunt?</font>

441
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,130
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,130
<font color="yellow">What are you glaring at?</font>

469
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,060
<font color="yellow">You're ugly.</font>

470
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,130
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

471
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,700
<font color="yellow">(1: WRITE A DIARY, 2: STUDY ENGLISH)</font>

472
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,000
<font color="yellow">I'll call your dad separately,</font>

473
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,530
<font color="yellow">but tell him to come see me anyway.</font>

474
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,530
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

475
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,700
<font color="yellow">Where does she live?</font>

476
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,970
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

477
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,200
<font color="yellow">Isn't there anyone who knows?</font>

478
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,030
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Hello.</font>

479
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,060
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

480
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,500
<font color="yellow">Mo Hwi Cheol. What brings you here?</font>

481
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,060
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for someone. I've got the name and address.</font>

482
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,660
<font color="yellow">Why? Did a con go wrong?</font>

483
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
<font color="yellow">Since when do you care?</font>

484
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,860
<font color="yellow">I don't.</font>

485
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,130
<font color="yellow">500 dollars up front.</font>

486
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,760
<font color="yellow">I'll have to make it up with something else.</font>

487
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,970
<font color="yellow">You're joking, right?</font>

488
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,660
<font color="yellow">Why don't you join them over there?</font>

489
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,630
<font color="yellow">You could pay me with your winnings.</font>

490
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,230
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

491
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,100
<font color="yellow">It's a bomb.</font>

492
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,130
<font color="yellow">I win.</font>

493
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,630
<font color="yellow">I'll get you next time.</font>

494
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,560
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

495
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,970
<font color="yellow">Isn't there any other way?</font>

496
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,930
<font color="yellow">There is.</font>

497
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,300
<font color="yellow">But are you up for it?</font>

498
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,360
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever it takes.</font>

499
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,400
<font color="yellow">Just find the person I'm looking for.</font>

500
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,730
<font color="yellow">That aunt you're looking for is Kim Young Ji.</font>

501
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,600
<font color="yellow">She got a divorce three years ago.</font>

502
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,130
<font color="yellow">She has a daughter, but they're not blood-related.</font>

503
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
<font color="yellow">What about her birth mother?</font>

504
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,100
<font color="yellow">I'll have to increase the payment for that information.</font>

505
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,400
<font color="yellow">Where is this person right now?</font>

506
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,300
<font color="yellow">By the looks of the credit card history,</font>

507
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,700
<font color="yellow">she's leaving the country.</font>

508
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,730
<font color="yellow">She sold her house.</font>

509
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,130
<font color="yellow">Who's her birth mother?</font>

510
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,800
<font color="yellow">I tried my best.</font>

511
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,000
<font color="yellow">Is abandoning a child the best you can do?</font>

512
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,000
<font color="yellow">What more do you want from me?</font>

513
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,200
<font color="yellow">I raised someone else's daughter all this time.</font>

514
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,130
<font color="yellow">You were paid to do that.</font>

515
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,300
<font color="yellow">Where's your sense of responsibility?</font>

516
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Are you lecturing me?</font>

517
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,930
<font color="yellow">You're the one who wasn't even aware...</font>

518
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,760
<font color="yellow">of your child's presence until now.</font>

519
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,530
<font color="yellow">She calls you, "Aunt".</font>

520
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,660
<font color="yellow">You weren't planning on taking care of her, were you?</font>

521
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,230
<font color="yellow">You think you did your best?</font>

522
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,360
<font color="yellow">Do you know what condition she was in when we met?</font>

523
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,470
<font color="yellow">Was that the best you could do? Answer me!</font>

524
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,230
<font color="yellow">You're right. I told her to call me her aunt.</font>

525
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
<font color="yellow">And what would happen to me...</font>

526
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,730
<font color="yellow">when her birth mother shows up asking her back?</font>

527
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,000
<font color="yellow">How can a dead person come looking for her?</font>

528
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
<font color="yellow">She's alive?</font>

529
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,260
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that to her, then?</font>

530
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,360
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me.</font>

531
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,100
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

532
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
<font color="yellow">I don't care why she lied...</font>

533
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,760
<font color="yellow">or why she abandoned her own child,</font>

534
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,730
<font color="yellow">but how am I her father?</font>

535
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,760
<font color="yellow">- Why not?
- Come on!</font>

536
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,800
<font color="yellow">I can't be the only one she slept with!</font>

537
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,900
<font color="yellow">No matter how foolish,</font>

538
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,230
<font color="yellow">she can tell who the real father is.</font>

539
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,430
<font color="yellow">Did she say that?</font>

540
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,660
<font color="yellow">Is she sure she's mine?</font>

541
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,360
<font color="yellow">How can you not recognize your own daughter?</font>

542
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,400
<font color="yellow">Where is she now?</font>

543
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,760
<font color="yellow">Where is Joo Young right now?</font>

544
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

545
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,060
<font color="yellow">You don't know?</font>

546
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,970
<font color="yellow">I heard that...</font>

547
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,430
<font color="yellow">she fled to Spain five years ago.</font>

548
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,330
<font color="yellow">Didn't Geum Bi tell you?</font>

549
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
<font color="yellow">Tell me what?</font>

550
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,300
<font color="yellow">About herself.</font>

551
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,730
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Forget it.</font>

552
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,530
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything to say to you anymore.</font>

553
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,800
<font color="yellow">Don't come looking for me.</font>

554
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

555
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,530
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

556
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,360
<font color="yellow">Are you Geum Bi's grandfather?</font>

557
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,860
<font color="yellow">Who's Geum Bi?</font>

558
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,860
<font color="yellow">What kind of a kid doesn't have a home?</font>

559
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,930
<font color="yellow">What does her parents do exactly?</font>

560
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:49,030
<font color="yellow">This school isn't for children-in-needs.</font>

561
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,400
<font color="yellow">I can't send my kid here knowing what I know.</font>

562
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,470
<font color="yellow">What happened, Geum Bi?</font>

563
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,630
<font color="yellow">I can't seem to reach your father.</font>

564
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,930
<font color="yellow">You don't live where it says you do.</font>

565
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,530
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

566
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you a question.</font>

567
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,660
<font color="yellow">Where are you staying right now?</font>

568
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,700
<font color="yellow">Like I said, she'll have to follow the regulations.</font>

569
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,230
<font color="yellow">Isn't there any other way?</font>

570
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,700
<font color="yellow">If a child doesn't have any relatives,</font>

571
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:30,200
<font color="yellow">we have to take measures according to the rules.</font>

572
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,360
<font color="yellow">Can't we find a way if I visit...</font>

573
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,930
<font color="yellow">the Welfare Center?</font>

574
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,030
<font color="yellow">I do feel sorry for Geum Bi,</font>

575
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,660
<font color="yellow">but there are rules so it might not work.</font>

<font color="yellow">He isn't picking up.</font>

578
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,260
<font color="yellow">Maybe he ended up dead somewhere.</font>

579
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,130
<font color="yellow">Don't say things like that.</font>

580
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,600
<font color="yellow">Where on earth did he go?</font>

581
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,200
<font color="yellow">If I find him, I'll kill him myself.</font>

582
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,730
<font color="yellow">I thought this was waterproof.</font>

583
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,630
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's waterproof.</font>

584
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,430
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

585
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,900
<font color="yellow">Once the rain gets in, it doesn't go out.</font>

586
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,200
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Go away.</font>

587
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,130
<font color="yellow">I'm in no mood to deal with you.</font>

588
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,530
<font color="yellow">I heard you're going to an orphanage.</font>

589
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,500
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Didn't you know?</font>

590
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,130
<font color="yellow">Your aunt and dad both ran away so now,</font>

591
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,900
<font color="yellow">you have to go to an orphanage.</font>

592
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,200
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

593
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,700
<font color="yellow">Is he not picking up?</font>

594
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,930
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Geum Bi.</font>

595
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,060
<font color="yellow">I'll figure something out.</font>

596
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,200
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Ever since we were in the hospital,</font>

597
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,130
<font color="yellow">I was preparing to go to an orphanage.</font>

598
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,530
<font color="yellow">I won't send you away.</font>

599

<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

600
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,130
<font color="yellow">It's time to earn your keep.</font>

601

605
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,200
<font color="yellow">Go and get 5,000 from them.</font>

606
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,100
<font color="yellow">I'll call us even plus a little allowance.</font>

607
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,500
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's not here.</font>

608
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,630
<font color="yellow">That's three days in a row.</font>

609
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,130
<font color="yellow">Has anyone seen Geum Bi outside of school?</font>

610
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,260
<font color="yellow">- No.
- No.</font>

611
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,300

612
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,530
<font color="yellow">No. Is something wrong?</font>

613
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,230
<font color="yellow">I'll scream.</font>

614
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,700
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

615
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,760
<font color="yellow">Do you miss your dad?</font>

616
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,660
<font color="yellow">Are you going to lie and say you're his friend?</font>

617
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,430
<font color="yellow">We were friends once.</font>

618
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,660
<font color="yellow">Not anymore.</font>

619
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,600
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

620
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,060
<font color="yellow">When you see your dad,</font>

621
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,830
