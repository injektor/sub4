<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

5
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:15,497
<font color="yellow">We should do everything necessary to save her.</font>

6
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:17,827
<font color="yellow">They said she might lose her hearing.</font>

7
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,827
<font color="yellow">And there might be other side effects, too.</font>

8
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:24,367
<font color="yellow">If it goes wrong, it'll be the opposite of saving her.</font>

9
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:28,097
<font color="yellow">If it's effective as they say, we should risk it.</font>

10
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:31,897
<font color="yellow">She needs more time until the gene therapy can work.</font>

11
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:34,297
<font color="yellow">Are you going to look away from a possibility?</font>

12
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,967
<font color="yellow">Later on, when I'm very sick,</font>

13
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:47,227
<font color="yellow">don't operate on me...</font>

14
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:49,527
<font color="yellow">or do anything painful to me.</font>

15
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:53,127
<font color="yellow">I hope you won't do anything like that.</font>

16
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:58,967
<font color="yellow">The spinal injections aren't guaranteed to work.</font>

17
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,097
<font color="yellow">They said it varies from patient to patient.</font>

18
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,837
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi might be fine.</font>

19
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,567
<font color="yellow">She's so normal right now.</font>

20
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,837
<font color="yellow">How is she normal?</font>

21
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:13,667
<font color="yellow">She didn't recognize you and collapsed from a seizure.</font>

22
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:16,837
<font color="yellow">Then, we can give her medication and bring her here.</font>

23
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:19,597
<font color="yellow">But if she even loses her hearing at her age,</font>

24
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,337
<font color="yellow">It's like living half a life.</font>

25
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,597
<font color="yellow">She has less than 10 years to live.</font>

26
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:26,427
<font color="yellow">How can you be so ignorant?</font>

27
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:29,627
<font color="yellow">Let's wait.</font>

28
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,067
<font color="yellow">Let's wait it out a little longer.</font>

29
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,897
<font color="yellow">You look fine,</font>

30
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:49,797
<font color="yellow">but I definitely look like I'm sick with my blue lips.</font>

31
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,127
<font color="yellow">No one would think we're both sick.</font>

32
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,167
<font color="yellow">It's a long story,</font>

33
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:58,367
<font color="yellow">but my body is a bit weird.</font>

34
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,997
<font color="yellow">It keeps on piling things called lipids...</font>

35
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,797
<font color="yellow">when it doesn't need them.</font>

36
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:05,767
<font color="yellow">That's awful.</font>

37
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:08,327
<font color="yellow">So it's not just in your brain,</font>

38
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,097
<font color="yellow">it piles up in your stomach, too.</font>

39
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:12,867
<font color="yellow">Everywhere.</font>

40
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,827
<font color="yellow">They will paralyze my body.</font>

41
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:17,927
<font color="yellow">What's with that?</font>

42
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,237
<font color="yellow">Apparently, I was born...</font>

43
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:23,527
<font color="yellow">with a different gene or something.</font>

44
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:26,697
<font color="yellow">Not a lot of people have this disease,</font>

45
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:28,667
<font color="yellow">so not many people care about it.</font>

46
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,737
<font color="yellow">I can't just take medicine,</font>

47
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:34,427
<font color="yellow">so I get huge shots in my spinal cord.</font>

48
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,327
<font color="yellow">It's awful.</font>

49
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:39,367

<font color="yellow">Stop taking pictures.</font>

54
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,197
<font color="yellow">I didn't even wash my face.</font>

55
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,867
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, is there anything you'd like to do?</font>

56
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:33,227
<font color="yellow">Should I try on some middle school uniforms?</font>

57
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,327
<font color="yellow">Are you worried about something?</font>

58
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:42,997
<font color="yellow">I'm not worried.</font>

59
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,527
<font color="yellow">Someone told me this.</font>

60
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,827
<font color="yellow">Most of your worries don't become a reality.</font>

61
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,167
<font color="yellow">Who said that?</font>

62
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,327

63
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:59,297

<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang, do you know him?</font>

71
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:27,597
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

72
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,697
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly.</font>

73
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:05,497
<font color="yellow">Why? Did it get caught in your throat?</font>

74
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,267
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly. No one is taking your food.</font>

75
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:09,827
<font color="yellow">You're so greedy.</font>

<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, what's wrong?</font>

79
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:26,037
<font color="yellow">It looks like she can't breathe.</font>

80
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,527
<font color="yellow">It's dysphagia.</font>

81
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:55,067
<font color="yellow">That means she can't swallow.</font>

82
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,927
<font color="yellow">It's a side effect from the medicine she's taking.</font>

83
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:03,897
<font color="yellow">Then should she quit taking it?</font>

84
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:07,167
<font color="yellow">Well, she can quit for a while and restart later.</font>

85
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,627
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't she take that spinal cord injections?</font>

96

<font color="yellow">Let's make it even more interesting.</font>

97

98

00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,767
<font color="yellow">You can do it.</font>

161
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,097
<font color="yellow">Hold it out all the way.</font>

162
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:56,167
<font color="yellow">Yes, a bit more.</font>

163
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,367
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

164
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,297
<font color="yellow">Hold it out.</font>

165
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:05,067
<font color="yellow">Hee Joon. You're doing good.</font>

166
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,727
<font color="yellow">Point at the doctor.</font>

167
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,897
<font color="yellow">Hold out your arm.</font>

168
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:13,727
<font color="yellow">I think Geum Bi's loss of hearing...</font>

169
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,097
<font color="yellow">is a side effect from cyclodextrin.</font>

170
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:26,097
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself for it.</font>

171
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,427
<font color="yellow">You two are trying...</font>

172
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:31,427
<font color="yellow">everything the current medical science allows.</font>

173
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,927
<font color="yellow">You'll have to make more difficult decisions later on.</font>

174
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,397
<font color="yellow">It could be harder on you than it is for Geum Bi.</font>

175
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:48,097
<font color="yellow">If I may say so,</font>

176
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,597
<font color="yellow">don't give up now...</font>

177
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,327
<font color="yellow">and protect her to the very end.</font>

178
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:54,727
<font color="yellow">I will also try my absolute best...</font>

179
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,497
<font color="yellow">until the very end.</font>

180
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,697
<font color="yellow">According to the test results,</font>

181
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,597
<font color="yellow">her auditory cells haven't been completely impaired.</font>

182
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:08,427
<font color="yellow">There's a chance of recovery.</font>

183
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,197
<font color="yellow">We'll give her hearing-aid and see how it goes.</font>

184
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,627
<font color="yellow">Hearing-aid?</font>

185
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,267
<font color="yellow">I want to keep having the injections.</font>

186
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,097
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat?</font>

187
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,097
<font color="yellow">Fried sweet potatoes.</font>

188
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,337
<font color="yellow">Fried sweet potatoes?</font>

189
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:05,697
<font color="yellow">I'll make them for you when we go home.</font>

190
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,697
<font color="yellow">Come in if you'd like.</font>

191
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:37,397
<font color="yellow">Your seat is over there.</font>

192
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:41,897
<font color="yellow">Why would there be my seat here?</font>

193
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:47,997
<font color="yellow">Zavesca...</font>

194
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:49,967
<font color="yellow">Cyclodextrin...</font>

195
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,867
<font color="yellow">I heard she developed side effects from both.</font>

196
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:55,197
<font color="yellow">It must've been extremely painful,</font>

197
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:58,897
<font color="yellow">but you're not one to give up there.</font>

198
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:00,697
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd come.</font>

199
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,697
<font color="yellow">I didn't make up my mind yet.</font>

200
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,927
<font color="yellow">That's what you're here to do.</font>

201
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,467
<font color="yellow">I came here for assurance.</font>

202
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:09,497
<font color="yellow">Do you know why...</font>

203
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:13,067
<font color="yellow">I'm so focused on this research?</font>

204
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:16,367
<font color="yellow">Would you do it knowing there's no money in it?</font>

205
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,567
<font color="yellow">I think it was 2 or 3 years ago.</font>

206
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,027
<font color="yellow">I read a thesis paper on gene therapy...</font>

207
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,197
<font color="yellow">and a news article on Niemann-Pick disease.</font>

208
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:30,527
<font color="yellow">At that moment,</font>

209
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,497
<font color="yellow">those two created an idea in my mind.</font>

210
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:38,097
<font color="yellow">I was destined to do this.</font>

211
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,837
<font color="yellow">This is not a joint research.</font>

212
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,527
<font color="yellow">Consider yourself being under surveillance.</font>

213
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:50,127
<font color="yellow">The data I've gathered over the years...</font>

214
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,967
<font color="yellow">are on your desk.</font>

215
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:22,897
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to do it?</font>

216
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,197
<font color="yellow">Do what?</font>

217
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,097
<font color="yellow">You've been fiddling with that ring for an hour now.</font>

218
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,097
<font color="yellow">What? What ring?</font>

219
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,167
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

220
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:40,697
<font color="yellow">Especially in your case, there's a sick kid involved.</font>

221
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:42,727
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

222
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:46,227
<font color="yellow">Knowing and living are two completely different things.</font>

223
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:48,027
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what are you saying?</font>

224
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:50,227
<font color="yellow">With a sick kid, you won't be able to do anything.</font>

225
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:51,967
<font color="yellow">When everyone else is happy,</font>

226
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,997
<font color="yellow">you'll feel like it's the end of the world.</font>

227
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:55,667
<font color="yellow">When you try to get intimate,</font>

228
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,467
<font color="yellow">you'll feel like it's not right.</font>

229
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,197
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

230
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:00,767
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about marriage?</font>

231
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,727
<font color="yellow">Why would something like that matter?</font>

232
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,767
<font color="yellow">It is something that matters.</font>

233
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,797
<font color="yellow">When your child gets sick,</font>

234
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:09,027
<font color="yellow">the marriage will hit rock bottom in a heartbeat.</font>

235
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,167
<font color="yellow">Do you really think you can put up with it?</font>

236
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,567
<font color="yellow">By the way, where on earth is Chi Soo?</font>

237
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,027
<font color="yellow">Should I turn on the lights?</font>

238
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:47,797
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

239
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,927
<font color="yellow">We should've done as you said.</font>

240
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,097
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

241
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,667
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi will only suffer more.</font>

242
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,827
<font color="yellow">She can't even hear now.</font>

243
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:26,667
<font color="yellow">I can't turn on the lights even if you want me to.</font>

244
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,267
<font color="yellow">I'm too embarrassed.</font>

245
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,727
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

246
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:38,197
<font color="yellow">I ran away from making hard decisions...</font>

247
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:41,027
<font color="yellow">and left them all to you.</font>

248
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:45,027
<font color="yellow">I'll do that from now on.</font>

249
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,867
<font color="yellow">I'm the father.</font>

250
00:22:58,597 --> 00:22:59,967
<font color="yellow">Leave it to me.</font>

251
00:23:00,627 --> 00:23:01,827
<font color="yellow">And trust me.</font>

252
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:35,097
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's mom.</font>

253
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:46,567
<font color="yellow">The three of us will be together no matter what.</font>

254
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:50,627
<font color="yellow">The three of us.</font>

255
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,367
<font color="yellow">She's so pretty.</font>

256
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:38,067
<font color="yellow">Mo Hwi Cheol,</font>

257
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,597
<font color="yellow">will you never fight with the bride, Go Kang Hee,</font>

258
00:24:40,597 --> 00:24:42,027
<font color="yellow">never run away,</font>

259
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,667
<font color="yellow">share delicious food with her,</font>

260
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,667
<font color="yellow">starve when you don't have any...</font>

261
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:53,667
<font color="yellow">Anyway, can you live happily ever after with her?</font>

262
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:55,827
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

263
00:24:57,027 --> 00:24:58,467
<font color="yellow">What about the bride?</font>

264
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,797
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

265
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:06,397
<font color="yellow">I want my younger sibling to have dimples like me.</font>

266
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:08,097
<font color="yellow">I want to see them soon.</font>

267
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:09,297
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

268
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,927
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

269
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:14,467
<font color="yellow">Face each other.</font>

270
00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:22,067
<font color="yellow">It's time...</font>

271
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:26,627
<font color="yellow">to kiss.</font>

272
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:31,097
<font color="yellow">Kiss, kiss.</font>

273
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,067
<font color="yellow">Kiss, kiss.</font>

274
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:36,367
<font color="yellow">Kiss, kiss.</font>

275
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,797
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up and finish. - What are you waiting for?</font>

276
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:41,997
<font color="yellow">Just finish it up.</font>

277
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:54,927
<font color="yellow">Okay, this is great. You may walk down the aisle.</font>

278
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:55,167
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

279
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:01,467
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, were you practicing?</font>

280
00:27:02,797 --> 00:27:04,097
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

281
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:09,697
<font color="yellow">I walked three more steps than yesterday.</font>

282
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:13,097
<font color="yellow">Really? You'll start running next week.</font>

283
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:16,567
<font color="yellow">You're sweating.</font>

284
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:20,397
<font color="yellow">Let me bring you some water.</font>

285
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:16,297
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

286
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:18,727
<font color="yellow">Do you want a fork?</font>

287
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:23,027
<font color="yellow">No. Just these.</font>

288
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:25,597
<font color="yellow">Do you want to try using chopsticks?</font>

289
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:37,467
<font color="yellow">It worked.</font>

290
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:06,967
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

291
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,927
<font color="yellow">Put it over here, please.</font>

292
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:11,967
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

293
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,867
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

294
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:15,867
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

295
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,167
<font color="yellow">Here. Goodbye.</font>

296
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:20,427
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

297
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,267
<font color="yellow">You're eating so well.</font>

298
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:23,827
<font color="yellow">That's my girl.</font>

299
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,097
<font color="yellow">Look at you go.</font>

300
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:28,997
<font color="yellow">Try using your chopsticks again.</font>

301
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:34,027
<font color="yellow">You're the best!</font>

302
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:36,167
<font color="yellow">- You're so good. - How is it?</font>

303
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,167
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

304
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:05,367
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving already?</font>

305
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:10,527
<font color="yellow">Yes. I requested an early leave.</font>

306
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,067
<font color="yellow">Is it your kid again?</font>

307
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,267
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're the only one with a kid.</font>

308
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:19,127
<font color="yellow">You should just sit at home and raise your kid...</font>

309
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:21,127
<font color="yellow">instead of coming here and causing harm.</font>

310
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,527
<font color="yellow">How many early leaves have you taken, anyway?</font>

311
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:27,497
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

312
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:06,197
<font color="yellow">You're doing so well.</font>

313
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:09,397
<font color="yellow">You did so well. Let's do it one more time.</font>

314
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:11,327
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

315
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,627
<font color="yellow">Why not? You're doing great today.</font>

316
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,667
<font color="yellow">Let's go back and forth just one more time.</font>

317
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:17,327
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

318
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,667
<font color="yellow">Just one more time, Geum Bi.</font>

319
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:30,067
<font color="yellow">Stand up. What are you doing?</font>

320
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,567
<font color="yellow">I said no!</font>

321
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:34,797
<font color="yellow">She's tired.</font>

322
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:37,097
<font color="yellow">Physical therapy is hard.</font>

323
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,697
<font color="yellow">Get up. Do it one more time.</font>

324
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,867
<font color="yellow">She said no.</font>

325
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:46,527
<font color="yellow">This isn't boot camp.</font>

326
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,197
<font color="yellow">You're draining her.</font>

327
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,927
<font color="yellow">Let's call it a day.</font>

328
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:52,727
<font color="yellow">I guess she's tired.</font>

329
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:57,897
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

330
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:26,697
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

331
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,297
<font color="yellow">Try again. You can do it.</font>

332
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,427
<font color="yellow">Here, give me your hand.</font>

333
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:39,967
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

334
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,897
<font color="yellow">Try again. You need to eat.</font>

335
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:04,267
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you not want to eat?</font>

336
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,197
<font color="yellow">Do you want to use these?</font>

337
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:15,567
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

338
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:18,267
<font color="yellow">This isn't child's play.</font>

339
00:34:26,427 --> 00:34:28,567
<font color="yellow">Try again.</font>

340
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,297
<font color="yellow">Not like that. That's it.</font>

341
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:33,097
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, even if it's hard,</font>

342
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:34,997
<font color="yellow">you need to keep trying.</font>

343
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,197
<font color="yellow">Push harder.</font>

344
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,427
<font color="yellow">A little bit harder.</font>

345
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:40,967
<font color="yellow">You can do it.</font>

346
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,237
<font color="yellow">Push into it.</font>

347
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:43,567
<font color="yellow">Will you stop it?</font>

348
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:46,367
<font color="yellow">She doesn't want to eat.</font>

349
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:49,197
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol.</font>

350
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,237
<font color="yellow">She doesn't want to do it.</font>

351
00:34:53,197 --> 00:34:54,667
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep forcing her?</font>

352
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,067
<font color="yellow">I want to go.</font>

353
00:35:21,697 --> 00:35:22,737
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol.</font>

354
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:23,737
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

355
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:26,027
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to turn her into a fool?</font>

356
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:28,237
<font color="yellow">A fool?</font>

357
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,297
<font color="yellow">You keep letting her have her way.</font>

358
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,767
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep forcing her to do things?</font>

359
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:34,427
<font color="yellow">Even I'd get sick of it.</font>

360
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:36,737
<font color="yellow">Practice is all good,</font>

361
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:39,027
<font color="yellow">but give up after a while. She's tired.</font>

362
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,927
<font color="yellow">If you keep stopping because she's tired,</font>

363
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:43,767
<font color="yellow">what will you do later on?</font>

364
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,397
<font color="yellow">Stop pushing us both.</font>

365
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:48,097
<font color="yellow">I asked you to trust me.</font>

366
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:50,497
<font color="yellow">I have an idea and a plan.</font>

367
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:51,697
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

368
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:55,027
<font color="yellow">Do you think coddling her makes you a dad?</font>

369
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:12,897
<font color="yellow">As the disease advances, her personality can change.</font>

370
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:16,067
<font color="yellow">She can become rough and aggressive...</font>

371
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:18,737
<font color="yellow">and repeated disappointments...</font>

372
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:20,427
<font color="yellow">can bring upon depression.</font>

373
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:22,827
<font color="yellow">Depression?</font>

374
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:26,297
<font color="yellow">What should we do then?</font>

375
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:29,467
<font color="yellow">Don't ever get angry or berate her.</font>

376
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:34,397
<font color="yellow">If you scold her, that's all she'll remember...</font>

377
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,097
<font color="yellow">and increased instability will worsen her condition.</font>

378
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,737
<font color="yellow">That becomes a vicious cycle.</font>

379
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:42,397
<font color="yellow">Even if she makes mistakes,</font>

380
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:45,867
<font color="yellow">try to console her and cheer her on.</font>

381
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:51,997
<font color="yellow">Her walking seems to be improving.</font>

382
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:55,197
<font color="yellow">If you keep supporting and helping her,</font>

383
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:56,997
<font color="yellow">it should be fine.</font>

384
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:12,627
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

385
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,397
<font color="yellow">Push the button until it's completely in the hole.</font>

386
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:17,967
<font color="yellow">Concentrate.</font>

387
00:37:26,237 --> 00:37:27,297
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

388
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:32,867
<font color="yellow">Do it again.</font>

389
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:42,097
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, you have to align the button...</font>

390
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:44,467
<font color="yellow">and the hole it goes into.</font>

391
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:45,927
<font color="yellow">Try again.</font>

392
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,797
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

393
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,867
<font color="yellow">Don't use your fingers too much.</font>

394
00:37:57,397 --> 00:37:58,997
<font color="yellow">Do it slowly.</font>

395
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:07,067
<font color="yellow">I won't do it.</font>

396
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:09,697
<font color="yellow">Do it again.</font>

397
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:12,167
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

398
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,497
<font color="yellow">Take your time. There's no need to rush.</font>

399
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:18,427
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

400
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:20,997
<font color="yellow">Don't rush it.</font>

401
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,767
<font color="yellow">Let's try again.</font>

402
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,797
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi. Geum Bi.</font>

403
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:32,097
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

404
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,067
<font color="yellow">Try again.</font>

405
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:51,597
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

406
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:53,027
<font color="yellow">Do it again.</font>

407
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:54,697
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

408
00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,197
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

409
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:01,527
<font color="yellow">Don't give up and try again.</font>

410
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:05,397
<font color="yellow">Why force me when I said no?</font>

411
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,367
<font color="yellow">You aren't even my real mom.</font>

412
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:11,597
<font color="yellow">How dare you.</font>

413
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,097
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

414
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:24,997
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

415
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,367
<font color="yellow">First, you corner her...</font>

416
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:32,167
<font color="yellow">and now you're hitting her?</font>

417
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,797
<font color="yellow">Who said I hit her?</font>

418
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:40,927
<font color="yellow">Is this what you do when I'm out?</font>

419
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,027
<font color="yellow">Do you scold and beat her?</font>

420
00:39:45,097 --> 00:39:48,237
<font color="yellow">Don't talk like that when you don't know anything.</font>

421
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:51,597
<font color="yellow">I said nothing because I didn't know.</font>

422
00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:55,097
<font color="yellow">Had I known you abuse her, I'd have done something.</font>

423
00:39:57,097 --> 00:39:58,427
<font color="yellow">Who's abusing her?</font>

424
00:39:58,427 --> 00:39:59,767
<font color="yellow">Are you sick of it?</font>

425
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:02,697
<font color="yellow">Have you had enough?</font>

426
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,737
<font color="yellow">Is this it?</font>

427
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:07,067
<font color="yellow">Then say you can't do it anymore!</font>

428
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:09,737
<font color="yellow">Don't torture the poor kid.</font>

429
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:15,467
<font color="yellow">How could you say that?</font>

430
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,897
<font color="yellow">Don't you know me?</font>

431
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:23,097
<font color="yellow">Would you have done that if she were your child?</font>

432
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:18,567
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

433
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:22,127
<font color="yellow">Did Mom...</font>

434
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,827
<font color="yellow">actually hit you?</font>

435
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,267
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi. Geum Bi.</font>

436
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:33,967
<font color="yellow">Why force me when I said no?</font>

437
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,927
<font color="yellow">You aren't even my real mom.</font>

438
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,267
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

439
00:45:58,197 --> 00:45:59,597
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call ahead?</font>

440
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:01,327
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi's asleep.</font>

441
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:06,027
<font color="yellow">I guess she didn't tell you.</font>

442
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:10,867
<font color="yellow">She hasn't been feeling well.</font>

443
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,297
<font color="yellow">Can I see her?</font>

444
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,927
<font color="yellow">Has she gotten that bad?</font>

445
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,927
<font color="yellow">She'll only get worse.</font>

446
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:32,897
<font color="yellow">There's nothing we can do.</font>

447
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:38,497
<font color="yellow">You knew this would happen.</font>

448
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:43,097
<font color="yellow">Yes. Knowing and not being able to do anything...</font>

449
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:46,367
<font color="yellow">is what makes it all worse.</font>

450
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,427
<font color="yellow">What should I do now?</font>

451
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:01,627
<font color="yellow">You must be going through a lot because of Geum Bi.</font>

452
00:47:02,467 --> 00:47:05,297
<font color="yellow">I'd never be able to do what you're doing.</font>

453
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:09,267
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid.</font>

454
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,397
<font color="yellow">That you might not withstand it?</font>

455
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,127
<font color="yellow">That I might change.</font>

456
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:23,797
<font color="yellow">That I'll end up hating her.</font>

457
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:29,697
<font color="yellow">I'm not yet married,</font>

458
00:47:29,697 --> 00:47:31,727
<font color="yellow">and I've never raised a child,</font>

459
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:34,767
<font color="yellow">but I'm a good judge when it comes to moms.</font>

460
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,827
<font color="yellow">I always have the same thought when I see you.</font>

461
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,327
<font color="yellow">When I become a wife and a mom,</font>

462
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:45,667
<font color="yellow">I would like to become one like you.</font>

463
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:05,927
<font color="yellow">Think that we're all like Geum Bi.</font>

464
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:07,627
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

465
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,027
<font color="yellow">Treat other people...</font>

466
00:48:12,027 --> 00:48:14,497
<font color="yellow">like you treat Geum Bi.</font>

467
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:17,067
<font color="yellow">With ease and comfort.</font>

468
00:48:23,197 --> 00:48:24,727
<font color="yellow">If it's too hard,</font>

469
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:28,267
<font color="yellow">you can practice with me.</font>

470
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:37,867
<font color="yellow">When you meet...</font>

471
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:41,367
<font color="yellow">a type of person you've never met before,</font>

472
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:45,467
<font color="yellow">it's natural that you'd be curious.</font>

473
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:50,827
<font color="yellow">I can tell what type of person you are...</font>

474
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,627
<font color="yellow">by the way you treat Geum Bi.</font>

475
00:48:56,927 --> 00:49:00,097
<font color="yellow">I want you to start anew.</font>

476
00:49:00,797 --> 00:49:02,427
<font color="yellow">You adore Geum Bi,</font>

477
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:05,127
<font color="yellow">and you donate your hard-earned money...</font>

478
00:49:05,897 --> 00:49:08,097
<font color="yellow">to the orphanage, which is great.</font>

479
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:11,727
<font color="yellow">I'm saying you should treasure yourself first.</font>

480
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:18,067
<font color="yellow">I think you deserve...</font>

481
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:20,897
<font color="yellow">to love yourself a little bit.</font>

482
00:49:31,227 --> 00:49:33,327
<font color="yellow">Thanks for visiting me.</font>

483
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:34,997
<font color="yellow">Eat all you want.</font>

484
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:38,927
<font color="yellow">You're wearing a school uniform.</font>

485
00:49:39,427 --> 00:49:42,227
<font color="yellow">Of course. What else would a student wear?</font>

486
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:44,197
<font color="yellow">Do you go to school?</font>

487
00:49:44,797 --> 00:49:46,397
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

488
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:50,267
<font color="yellow">It must be nice to wear a school uniform.</font>

489
00:49:50,597 --> 00:49:52,967
<font color="yellow">You'll wear one when you go to middle school.</font>

490
00:49:54,027 --> 00:49:55,367
<font color="yellow">Middle school?</font>

491
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:59,397
<font color="yellow">I wonder if I'll ever get to go.</font>

492
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,367
<font color="yellow">Of course you can.</font>

493
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:02,827
<font color="yellow">Can I?</font>

494
00:50:03,497 --> 00:50:05,267
<font color="yellow">Can I wear a uniform?</font>

495
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:06,897
<font color="yellow">You bet you can.</font>

496
00:50:07,427 --> 00:50:08,827
<font color="yellow">If you have to wear one,</font>

497
00:50:08,827 --> 00:50:10,467
<font color="yellow">go to a school with a pretty uniform.</font>

498
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:18,067
<font color="yellow">Do you have a boyfriend?</font>

499
00:50:19,027 --> 00:50:20,397
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

500
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:30,327
<font color="yellow">Dad, So Hee's here.</font>

501
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:31,997
<font color="yellow">You've met her before.</font>

502
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:35,927
<font color="yellow">So Hee, he's my dad.</font>

503
00:50:44,397 --> 00:50:45,927
<font color="yellow">Don't just stand there.</font>

504
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:47,997
<font color="yellow">So Hee said hi.</font>

505
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:52,297
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

506
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,897
<font color="yellow">You can stay a little longer.</font>

507
00:50:57,697 --> 00:50:59,267
<font color="yellow">She wants to leave...</font>

508
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:01,267
<font color="yellow">because you're acting all weird.</font>

509
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:08,667
<font color="yellow">Oh, sorry, my bad.</font>

510
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,967
<font color="yellow">Have fun with Geum Bi.</font>

511
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:12,497
<font color="yellow">Take your time.</font>

512
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:15,627
<font color="yellow">Yes, stay a little longer.</font>

513
00:51:15,627 --> 00:51:17,267
<font color="yellow">Stay for lunch, too.</font>

514
00:51:26,227 --> 00:51:29,297
<font color="yellow">Really? Do you do things like that in school?</font>

515
00:51:29,697 --> 00:51:32,567
<font color="yellow">Do you really? That's awesome.</font>

516
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:06,867
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

517
00:52:08,197 --> 00:52:09,397
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

518
00:52:09,997 --> 00:52:12,097
<font color="yellow">have a friend over today?</font>

519
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,667
<font color="yellow">No. What friend?</font>

520
00:52:20,197 --> 00:52:21,197
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

521
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:26,397
<font color="yellow">Is it frustrating to be indoors all the time?</font>

522
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:29,627
<font color="yellow">It's really frustrating.</font>

523
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:34,927
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the promise I made on the way back...</font>

524
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:37,397
<font color="yellow">from watching the meteor shower?</font>

525
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,867
<font color="yellow">I told you I'd take you to see the sea.</font>

526
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,227
<font color="yellow">You did.</font>

527
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,327
<font color="yellow">Or you have to drink 10 bottles of fish sauce.</font>

528
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:54,497
<font color="yellow">You were too sick to go this summer.</font>

529
00:52:55,027 --> 00:52:56,197
<font color="yellow">Let's go tomorrow.</font>

530
00:52:57,527 --> 00:52:58,727
<font color="yellow">Can we?</font>

531
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:18,927
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

532
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:21,627
<font color="yellow">That's it? Keep running.</font>

533
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:24,527
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

534
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:26,697
<font color="yellow">You're so shameless.</font>

535
00:53:29,297 --> 00:53:30,327
<font color="yellow">Are you ready?</font>

536
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,127
<font color="yellow">Are you cold?</font>

537
00:53:57,927 --> 00:53:59,167
<font color="yellow">Are you hungry?</font>

538
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:37,567
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

539
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,627
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

540
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:44,897
<font color="yellow">Is it tough?</font>

541
00:54:45,927 --> 00:54:47,297
<font color="yellow">Is it tough?</font>

542
00:54:49,967 --> 00:54:52,067
<font color="yellow">If I'd known this would happen,</font>

543
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:54,797
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have come to you.</font>

544
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,427
<font color="yellow">Aren't you glad you came to me?</font>

545
00:54:58,697 --> 00:55:00,627
<font color="yellow">This is why I brought you.</font>

546
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:03,597
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

547
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:07,927
<font color="yellow">want to live with you for a long, long time.</font>

548
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,727
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll be able to.</font>

549
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:15,227
<font color="yellow">You and I...</font>

550
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,827
<font color="yellow">should travel and see things.</font>

551
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:21,827
<font color="yellow">The world is full of things to see.</font>

552
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:26,397
<font color="yellow">Someone told me...</font>

553
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:28,967
<font color="yellow">that life is like a picnic.</font>

554
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,067
<font color="yellow">When the picnic's over,</font>

555
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:33,927
<font color="yellow">we go back to the sky.</font>

556
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:38,167
<font color="yellow">Then we share stories about our picnics.</font>

557
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:41,267
<font color="yellow">We should go and see flowers.</font>

558
00:55:42,867 --> 00:55:44,397
<font color="yellow">When it gets warmer...</font>

559
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:46,627
<font color="yellow">let's go and see cherry blossoms,</font>

560
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:48,667
<font color="yellow">pear blossoms, azaleas, lilacs,</font>

561
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,897
<font color="yellow">and see all those things.</font>

562
00:55:52,397 --> 00:55:53,427
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

563
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:57,467
<font color="yellow">I had a lot of fun...</font>

564
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,727
<font color="yellow">since I met you, Dad.</font>

565
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:05,197
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

566
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,697
<font color="yellow">once my picnic is over,</font>

567
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:12,367
<font color="yellow">I want you to have as much fun as I did.</font>

568
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,967
<font color="yellow">Don't go...</font>

569
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:17,227
<font color="yellow">and have fun without me.</font>

570
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:18,727
<font color="yellow">Take me along.</font>

571
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,327
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your great picnic...</font>

572
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,727
<font color="yellow">and tell me stories later.</font>

573
00:56:49,097 --> 00:56:50,297
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

574
00:56:54,627 --> 00:56:55,697
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

575
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:22,097
<font color="yellow">We're back.</font>

576
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,097
<font color="yellow">We're back.</font>

577
00:57:28,627 --> 00:57:30,027
<font color="yellow">Dinner's ready.</font>

578
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:32,027
<font color="yellow">Where did you both go...</font>

579
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:34,097
<font color="yellow">without me?</font>

580
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:07,567
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

581
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:12,827
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

582
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:22,197
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee.</font>

583
00:58:24,197 --> 00:58:26,827
<font color="yellow">Who are you here to see?</font>

584
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:33,067
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

585
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:37,197
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee.</font>

586
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:39,397
<font color="yellow">Who are you here to see?</font>

587
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:41,227
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

588
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:43,227
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

589
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:53,897
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee.</font>

590
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:59,167
<font color="yellow">If you go far, far away,</font>

591
00:59:00,497 --> 00:59:03,097
<font color="yellow">I will go to the seashore every day...</font>

592
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:07,097
<font color="yellow">and fly a kite as I wait for you.</font>

<font color="yellow">If you go far, far away,</font>

594
00:59:09,927 --> 00:59:12,097

<font color="yellow">If the strong sea winds make me sick,</font>

598
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,927
<font color="yellow">I will ask for Hwi Cheol's help before I die.</font>

599
00:59:30,027 --> 00:59:31,867
<font color="yellow">Don't say things like that.</font>

600
00:59:32,927 --> 00:59:35,397
<font color="yellow">I'll ask him to bury me by the sea...</font>

601
00:59:36,267 --> 00:59:39,397
<font color="yellow">and fly a kite by my grave every day.</font>

602
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:44,767
<font color="yellow">I'll ask him to tie it to my tombstone.</font>

<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

604
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:52,897

605
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:56,797
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare try to con her.</font>

606
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:59,897
<font color="yellow">I'll report you to the police right away.</font>

<font color="yellow">Sure, I will.</font>

611
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:19,867
<font color="yellow">What about me? Read mine, too.</font>

612
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:24,297
<font color="yellow">I don't even have to consult the cards.</font>

613
01:00:25,227 --> 01:00:26,297
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

614
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:29,667
<font color="yellow">Just eat your food.</font>

615
01:00:32,267 --> 01:00:33,567
