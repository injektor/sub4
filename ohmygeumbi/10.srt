<font color="yellow">Give me a week.</font>

14
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,733
<font color="yellow">I'll come and pick her up tomorrow at two.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

22
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:21,573
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:25,203
<font color="yellow">I've seen many cases of people who gave up...</font>

24

<font color="yellow">after exercising their parental rights.</font>

25
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:29,633
<font color="yellow">She's a very good kid.</font>

26
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,203
<font color="yellow">Don't make her regret her decision.</font>

27
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,733
<font color="yellow">All right. Mind your own business.</font>

28
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:45,973
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

29
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:47,773

<font color="yellow">Do you not want to live with me?</font>

31
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:56,433
<font color="yellow">I do. Until the moment I die.</font>

32
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,203
<font color="yellow">Then why?</font>

33
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:02,973
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what kind of person that woman is?</font>

34
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,733
<font color="yellow">What have you done to my daughter?</font>

35
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:09,773
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

36
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:13,003
<font color="yellow">I need to teach you a lesson.</font>

37
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:16,233
<font color="yellow">You jerk. Come back here.</font>

38
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,503
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

39
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,133
<font color="yellow">I feel like if I leave that lady alone,</font>

40
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,203
<font color="yellow">she'll die before I do.</font>

41
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,773
<font color="yellow">I can't live with all three of you...</font>

42

<font color="yellow">under the same roof.</font>

43
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,333
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

44
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:11,903
<font color="yellow">I'm skeptical about your credentials as a parent.</font>

45
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:14,173
<font color="yellow">But that girl said,</font>

46
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,573
<font color="yellow">"I wish that lady would have a good life, too."</font>

47
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:19,473
<font color="yellow">"In order to do that,"</font>

48
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,603
<font color="yellow">"I think I need to be by her side."</font>

49
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,273
<font color="yellow">Wear those shoes when you go.</font>

50
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:52,103
<font color="yellow">I don't want to ruin them.</font>

51
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,073
<font color="yellow">They're just shoes.</font>

52
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:56,533
<font color="yellow">I could buy you thousands of them.</font>

53
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:58,173
<font color="yellow">You can wear them whenever you want.</font>

54
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,703
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

55
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:07,173
<font color="yellow">Can't you just...</font>

56
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,173
<font color="yellow">live with your dad and me?</font>

57
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:19,933
<font color="yellow">I wish everything would stay like this.</font>

58
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:21,933
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

59
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:26,343
<font color="yellow">I wish nothing would change...</font>

60
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,173
<font color="yellow">when I come back here.</font>

61
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,033
<font color="yellow">You will come back, right?</font>

62
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,133
<font color="yellow">But you can't call me.</font>

63
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:41,203
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

64
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,773
<font color="yellow">I need to be by that lady's side.</font>

65
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:50,103
<font color="yellow">If I hear you or Dad's voice,</font>

66
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:52,873
<font color="yellow">I'll want to come back right away.</font>

67
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:58,033
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

68
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:00,843
<font color="yellow">Even if we don't see or hear from each other,</font>

69
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:02,973
<font color="yellow">you won't forget me, will you?</font>

70
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:11,433
<font color="yellow">When that lady can start being on her own,</font>

71
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:14,633
<font color="yellow">I will come back.</font>

72
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:22,603
<font color="yellow">But what if I run out of time?</font>

73
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,843
<font color="yellow">I don't have much time.</font>

74
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:34,203
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense.</font>

75
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:39,003
<font color="yellow">If you don't come back, I'll come for you.</font>

76
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,173
<font color="yellow">I'll leave it like this...</font>

77
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,133
<font color="yellow">until you come back.</font>

78
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:03,533
<font color="yellow">Nothing will change.</font>

79
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:12,903
<font color="yellow">Let's do that thing.</font>

80
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:14,633
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

81
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:18,173
<font color="yellow">That thing.</font>

82
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:20,733
<font color="yellow">The hand thing.</font>

83
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:04,603
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

84
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:07,403
<font color="yellow">This isn't as easy as robbing a piggy bank.</font>

85
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,103
<font color="yellow">You don't have to push me.</font>

86
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:11,133
<font color="yellow">I'll give it to you in time.</font>

87
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:13,973
<font color="yellow">- Unbelievable. - Pardon me?</font>

88
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,403
<font color="yellow">Who are you to say that you'll give it to me or not?</font>

89
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,133
<font color="yellow">The procedures are...</font>

90
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:21,533
<font color="yellow">What procedures?</font>

91
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,103
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it as soon as possible.</font>

92
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:44,273
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're marrying her off. That's too much.</font>

93
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:45,733
<font color="yellow">You should've packed just the necessities.</font>

94
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:57,703
<font color="yellow">I wrote down things like...</font>

95
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:01,303
<font color="yellow">her favorite food and her doctor's number.</font>

96
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,933
<font color="yellow">She has to adapt,</font>

97
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,633
<font color="yellow">so don't call her.</font>

98
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:11,833
<font color="yellow">You, too.</font>

99
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,203
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

100
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,473
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

101
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,133
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

102
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:26,403
<font color="yellow">One hour!</font>

103
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:29,733
<font color="yellow">If you call, I'll be there in an hour wherever you are!</font>

104
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:31,833
<font color="yellow">Okay, Geum Bi?</font>

105
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:37,703
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi...</font>

106
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:51,803
<font color="yellow">One, eight, one, two.</font>

107
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:54,073
<font color="yellow">They're like card pairs. Easy, right?</font>

108
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,733
<font color="yellow">You must like gambling.</font>

109
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:59,073
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol taught me a long time ago.</font>

110
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,173
<font color="yellow">He only taught me bad things.</font>

111
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,773
<font color="yellow">Try it yourself.</font>

112
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:04,503
<font color="yellow">I don't need to do it.</font>

113
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,133
<font color="yellow">You said it's 1, 8, 1, 2.</font>

114
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:10,033
<font color="yellow">You know too much for a kid. How will you turn out?</font>

115
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,733
<font color="yellow">How did you want to turn out when you were a kid?</font>

116
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:14,203
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

117
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:16,873
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be a model.</font>

118
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:29,633
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't give me that look.</font>

119
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:33,203
<font color="yellow">I couldn't be a model because I got pregnant with you.</font>

120
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,303
<font color="yellow">One, eight, one, two.</font>

121
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,203
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

122
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,703
<font color="yellow">I can clean up.</font>

123
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,573
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

124
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,273
<font color="yellow">Is this a house for humans?</font>

125
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,103
<font color="yellow">Of course, it is.</font>

126
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:17,203
<font color="yellow">I'm not a dog.</font>

127
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,173
<font color="yellow">This smells.</font>

128
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,833
<font color="yellow">My goodness. It doesn't smell.</font>

129
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,303
<font color="yellow">You're too sensitive.</font>

130
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,503
<font color="yellow">I can't smell anything.</font>

131
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,173
<font color="yellow">I can wear it for a few more days.</font>

132
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,203
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

133
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,373
<font color="yellow">Those things are bad for you.</font>

134
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,973
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

135
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,073
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll wash them.</font>

136
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:04,503
<font color="yellow">You didn't have any detergent.</font>

137
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:07,673
<font color="yellow">My gosh. When did you notice that?</font>

138
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:12,933
<font color="yellow">I'm thirsty.</font>

139
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,733
<font color="yellow">I'll get some detergent.</font>

140
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,873
<font color="yellow">How did she manage to live?</font>

141
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:52,603
<font color="yellow">Did you drink beer?</font>

142
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:53,703
<font color="yellow">Water.</font>

143
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,003
<font color="yellow">Did I drink them all?</font>

144
00:12:58,273 --> 00:12:59,303
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

145
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:02,073
<font color="yellow">The sink drank it all.</font>

146
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:04,303
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

147
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:05,873
<font color="yellow">I threw them out.</font>

148
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:07,633
<font color="yellow">Threw what out?</font>

149
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,703
<font color="yellow">I drained them out in the sink.</font>

150
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,103
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

151
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:16,633
<font color="yellow">- Promise me. - What?</font>

152
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,373
<font color="yellow">Those were expensive beers.</font>

153
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:20,703
<font color="yellow">It's such a waste!</font>

154
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,603
<font color="yellow">Promise me that you won't drink.</font>

155
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,633
<font color="yellow">Hey. You can never trust anyone...</font>

156
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,373
<font color="yellow">who promises to quit smoking and drinking.</font>

157
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,733
<font color="yellow">You have no idea.</font>

158
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,503
<font color="yellow">I guess you missed this one.</font>

00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:34,133
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

316
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:43,503
<font color="yellow">The rice will begin to cook now.</font>

317
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:47,133
<font color="yellow">There's an open class.</font>

318
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:49,803
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

319
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:52,703
<font color="yellow">I hope it goes well.</font>

320
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:54,873
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what it is?</font>

321
00:27:57,603 --> 00:27:59,203
<font color="yellow">Oh, that thing.</font>

322
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,173
<font color="yellow">What about it?</font>

323
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:02,903
<font color="yellow">It's Friday at 1pm.</font>

324
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:07,173
<font color="yellow">Can I be your mom from next week?</font>

325
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:11,003
<font color="yellow">We don't even have any soup or stew.</font>

326
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:13,033
<font color="yellow">Are we eating rice by itself?</font>

327
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,403
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

328
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:20,003
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

329
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:22,273
<font color="yellow">Do you know how good this is?</font>

330
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,503
<font color="yellow">You'll be surprised.</font>

331
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,133
<font color="yellow">- Look, it's a fire. - Call 911.</font>

332
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,733
<font color="yellow">- Is that a fire? - Doesn't a kid live there?</font>

333
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,433
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no. - You're right.</font>

334
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,703
<font color="yellow">They should come out.</font>

335
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,933
<font color="yellow">Hello? Is this the 911?</font>

336
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,273
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. - There's a fire.</font>

337
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:15,633
<font color="yellow">Yoo Joo Young!</font>

338
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,403
<font color="yellow">Yoo Joo Young!</font>

339
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:39,373
<font color="yellow">Yoo Joo Young!</font>

340
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:41,203
<font color="yellow">Joo Young, get up.</font>

341
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,573
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - Are you okay?</font>

342
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,333
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi, get up.</font>

343
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:48,303
<font color="yellow">I'll take her.</font>

344
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:51,103
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

345
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:55,603
<font color="yellow">Did you set this fire?</font>

346
00:29:55,603 --> 00:29:57,773
<font color="yellow">Why are you stalking and bullying me?</font>

347
00:30:02,373 --> 00:30:03,373
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

348
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:11,133
<font color="yellow">(Emergency Medical Services)</font>

349
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,603
<font color="yellow">Let's check other places, too.</font>

350
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:13,703
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

351
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,033
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

352
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:22,373
<font color="yellow">You pretended to sleep to kill me, didn't you?</font>

353
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:25,103
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense. That would kill me, too.</font>

354
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,703
<font color="yellow">My gosh. You fell asleep, that's why.</font>

355
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:31,773
<font color="yellow">I thought I turned off the gas.</font>

356
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:34,273
<font color="yellow">- That's weird. - You didn't.</font>

357
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:36,873
<font color="yellow">Who did that, then? A ghost?</font>

358
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,003
<font color="yellow">You should've turned it off.</font>

359
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:40,903
<font color="yellow">You fell asleep, too.</font>

360
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:50,633
<font color="yellow">Don't be so proud.</font>

361
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,633
<font color="yellow">I would've lived even if it wasn't for you.</font>

362
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:54,203
<font color="yellow">Don't be mistaken.</font>

363
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,303
<font color="yellow">I kept you alive because you owe me.</font>

364
00:30:58,903 --> 00:30:59,973
<font color="yellow">What did the lawyer say?</font>

365
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,273
<font color="yellow">When will he give you the money?</font>

366
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,103
<font color="yellow">I thought you were a bad guy.</font>

367
00:31:24,203 --> 00:31:25,333
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

368
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:34,003
<font color="yellow">The kitchen is all burnt. What will I do?</font>

369
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:36,773
<font color="yellow">My landlord will go crazy.</font>

370
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:39,703
<font color="yellow">My gosh, whatever.</font>

371
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:45,203
<font color="yellow">I'll eat some eggs.</font>

372
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:00,573
<font color="yellow">What's that scar on your stomach?</font>

373
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:03,403
<font color="yellow">Did you see that? You have good eyes.</font>

374
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:07,133
<font color="yellow">Good places don't even leave scars.</font>

375
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:09,673
<font color="yellow">This is all because I went to a cheap hospital.</font>

376
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:11,273
<font color="yellow">I can't even wear cropped shirts.</font>

377
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:12,373
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

378
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:15,473
<font color="yellow">Do you know where babies come from?</font>

379
00:32:15,673 --> 00:32:17,533
<font color="yellow">Well, kind of.</font>

380
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:20,173
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it means, though.</font>

381
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,703
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, babies come out...</font>

382
00:32:23,373 --> 00:32:26,003
<font color="yellow">from a different place than other babies.</font>

383
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,003
<font color="yellow">Like you.</font>

384
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:29,203
<font color="yellow">Is that how I was born?</font>

385
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,173
<font color="yellow">It hurt really badly.</font>

386
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,633
<font color="yellow">Is that why you couldn't become a model?</font>

387
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:38,833
<font color="yellow">Forget about that. How good could a model be??</font>

388
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,673
<font color="yellow">What did you want to be, then?</font>

389
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:44,473
<font color="yellow">A celebrity.</font>

390
00:32:47,603 --> 00:32:49,103
<font color="yellow">What do you want to be?</font>

391
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,573
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

392
00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,173
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

393
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:03,003
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what I should want to be.</font>

394
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,073
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be something.</font>

395
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:14,873
<font color="yellow">You can just live happily day by day.</font>

396
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,733
<font color="yellow">- Day by day? - Yes.</font>

397
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:20,633
<font color="yellow">People always worry and live in the future.</font>

398
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,033
<font color="yellow">But one day, there will be no tomorrow.</font>

399
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,003
<font color="yellow">What if you regret your choices then?</font>

400
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:28,773
<font color="yellow">What's important is to be happy here and now.</font>

401
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:30,673
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

402
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:33,503
<font color="yellow">Do you like where you are, then?</font>

403
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,873
<font color="yellow">My gosh. No way.</font>

404
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:37,733
<font color="yellow">I burnt down my house...</font>

405
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,333
<font color="yellow">and now, I'm peeling eggs here.</font>

406
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:43,103
<font color="yellow">Did you write your diary?</font>

407
00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:46,173
<font color="yellow">Hey, I didn't sign that paper yet.</font>

408
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:49,203
<font color="yellow">Come on, write it. And we'll take a picture.</font>

409
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:51,473
<font color="yellow">Hey, are we taking it here?</font>

410
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,933
<font color="yellow">How can we take a picture here?</font>

411
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,133
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

412
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:56,773
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait.</font>

413
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:02,103
<font color="yellow">Say cheese.</font>

414
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:22,203
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

415
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:24,573
<font color="yellow">You're still up.</font>

416
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:26,833
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep.</font>

417
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:29,133
<font color="yellow">Everything's so strange.</font>

418
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:34,733
<font color="yellow">I lived here for over 30 years,</font>

419
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:37,603
<font color="yellow">but it's like a stranger's house.</font>

420
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:44,273
<font color="yellow">I was making dumplings to eat tomorrow.</font>

421
00:34:44,273 --> 00:34:45,473
<font color="yellow">Do you want to taste one?</font>

422
00:34:46,273 --> 00:34:47,273
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

423
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:51,433
<font color="yellow">so hard for me to come back to this house.</font>

424
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,103
<font color="yellow">Hwi Cheol.</font>

425
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:56,303
<font color="yellow">I can't live like the way I did before.</font>

426
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,073
<font color="yellow">But I can't continue to live like this.</font>

427
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:03,673
<font color="yellow">It's the same for me. But...</font>

428
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:05,133
<font color="yellow">What should I do now?</font>

429
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:09,703
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi said...</font>

430
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:13,333
<font color="yellow">she will come back.</font>

431
00:35:13,603 --> 00:35:14,703
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi...</font>

432
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,433
<font color="yellow">doesn't have much time.</font>

433
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:21,503
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't be like this.</font>

434
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:25,333
<font color="yellow">Did you forget what she said?</font>

435
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:30,543
<font color="yellow">She said she wanted nothing to change.</font>

436
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,187
<font color="yellow">What will you do about this?</font>

437
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:05,142
<font color="yellow">I knew this would happen!</font>

438
00:37:05,278 --> 00:37:08,008
<font color="yellow">This was our last packet of noodles!</font>

439
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:10,823
<font color="yellow">I have no money to buy more!</font>

440
00:37:18,273 --> 00:37:20,373
<font color="yellow">I told you it would rain.</font>

441
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,633
<font color="yellow">It's raining,</font>

442
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:09,103
<font color="yellow">Geum Bi.</font>

443
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,173
<font color="yellow">If you're going to do it, do it properly.</font>

444
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:29,673
<font color="yellow">Properly how?</font>

445
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:32,703
<font color="yellow">You don't just slap it on your face.</font>

446
00:38:32,703 --> 00:38:35,733
<font color="yellow">It just goes on your face. What's the difference?</font>

447
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:37,333
<font color="yellow">No, no, no, no.</font>

448
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,473
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

449
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:41,273
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

450
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:45,773
<font color="yellow">From the center of your face...</font>

451
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:47,873
<font color="yellow">and out towards your ears.</font>

452
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:50,003
<font color="yellow">Massage it in with a circular motion.</font>

453
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,073
<font color="yellow">Make sure it goes on evenly, okay?</font>

454
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:22,333
<font color="yellow">Next, it has to be absorbed.</font>

455
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:25,543
<font color="yellow">I don't do this for just anyone.</font>

456
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:26,603
<font color="yellow">Turn around.</font>

457
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,103
<font color="yellow">This is very important.</font>

458
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,203
<font color="yellow">Your skin has to absorb it all.</font>

459
00:39:35,203 --> 00:39:37,403
<font color="yellow">There's no point if it doesn't.</font>

460
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,873
<font color="yellow">What time's your open class?</font>

461
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:09,803
<font color="yellow">Friday at 1pm.</font>

462
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:14,203
<font color="yellow">Today, we'll experiment on observing various rocks...</font>

463
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,833
<font color="yellow">that form a stratum.</font>

464
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,503
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

465
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:21,903
<font color="yellow">Are you all wearing your goggles and gloves?</font>

466
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,273
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Yes.</font>

467
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:24,373
<font color="yellow">You need to be...</font>

468
00:40:24,373 --> 00:40:26,473
<font color="yellow">extra careful with diluted hydrochloric acid.</font>

469
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:27,973
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

470
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:37,203

<font color="yellow">and I haven't paid rent in months.</font>

496
00:43:10,073 --> 00:43:12,973

498

00:56:36,402 --> 00:56:38,262
<font color="yellow">What a stupid thing to believe in.</font>

629
00:56:40,103 --> 00:56:43,273
<font color="yellow">I just like the atmosphere here.</font>

630
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:46,933
<font color="yellow">It feels like my soul's taking a shower.</font>

631
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:49,903
<font color="yellow">I like the high ceilings, too.</font>

632
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,833
<font color="yellow">- Don't you? - Is this a cafe?</font>

633
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:54,833
<font color="yellow">It's not a place to come for good atmosphere.</font>

634
00:56:55,573 --> 00:56:58,003
<font color="yellow">I go to cafes and bars with different people.</font>

635
00:56:58,173 --> 00:57:00,703
<font color="yellow">It must be great to have many boyfriends.</font>

636
00:57:01,773 --> 00:57:03,033
<font color="yellow">You're the first.</font>

637
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:05,173
<font color="yellow">What do you mean first?</font>

638
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,933
<font color="yellow">I'm just one of them.</font>

639
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:10,573
<font color="yellow">You're the first I brought to the cathedral.</font>

640
00:57:13,003 --> 00:57:14,073
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

641
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:17,333
<font color="yellow">It's my first, too.</font>

642
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:20,073
<font color="yellow">- How so? - You're the first girl...</font>

643
00:57:20,073 --> 00:57:21,933
<font color="yellow">I didn't hold hands for over a month.</font>

644
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,773
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

645
00:57:26,303 --> 00:57:27,373
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

646
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:30,003
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

647
00:57:30,003 --> 00:57:31,703
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

648
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:33,573
<font color="yellow">It won't fall off, will it?</font>

649
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:38,203
<font color="yellow">You're like a cunning wolf.</font>

650
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:41,533
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

651
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:29,273
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

652
00:58:32,203 --> 00:58:33,503
<font color="yellow">What, Geum Bi?</font>

653
00:58:34,903 --> 00:58:37,273
<font color="yellow">You're my dad, aren't you?</font>

654
00:58:38,673 --> 00:58:39,933
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

655
00:58:42,373 --> 00:58:43,603
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

656
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:46,603
<font color="yellow">Mom keeps saying you aren't.</font>

657
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:49,703
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know better.</font>

658
00:58:51,103 --> 00:58:52,203
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

659
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:55,573
<font color="yellow">I love you so much.</font>

660
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,380
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

661
00:58:57,917 --> 00:59:00,187
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you.</font>

662
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,373
<font color="yellow">Wait just a bit longer.</font>

663
00:59:04,203 --> 00:59:06,033
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

664
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:10,173
<font color="yellow">I can wait until your enchanted underwear...</font>

665
00:59:10,173 --> 00:59:12,203
<font color="yellow">becomes old and ragged.</font>

666
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,903
<font color="yellow">What should I do about Mom?</font>

667
00:59:18,303 --> 00:59:20,073
<font color="yellow">Just give her some time.</font>

668
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:25,303
<font color="yellow">I don't have much time.</font>

669
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:29,773
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. She won't be too late.</font>
