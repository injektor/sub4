3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,240

<font color="yellow">Mr Shin Young Il does not drink champagne,</font>

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,280

<font color="yellow">What is his problem?</font>

8

<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,300
<font color="yellow">May we help you?</font>

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,490
<font color="yellow">We're from the prosecutor's office. Arrest them.</font>

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,790
<font color="yellow">Arrest whom for what?</font>

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,360
<font color="yellow">Wait. Wait. Come on, we're eating here.</font>

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,470
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
-  Hold on.</font>

14

<font color="yellow">What are we being arrested for?</font>

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,820
<font color="yellow">Hwang Ae Ra, for violating the Personal Information Act.</font>

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,060
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,060
<font color="yellow">Did I violate the National Security Law or something?</font>

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,390
<font color="yellow">You're under arrest for usury.</font>

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,220
<font color="yellow">Why are you treating us like terrorists...</font>

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,190
<font color="yellow">for little crimes like that?</font>

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,330
<font color="yellow">I'm their attorney.</font>

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,990
<font color="yellow">- What evidence do you have?
-  Take them away.</font>

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,130
<font color="yellow">Fine! I'll walk on my own!</font>

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,370
<font color="yellow">Please call Mr Joe!</font>

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,430
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,600
<font color="yellow">Dae Soo and Ae Ra were taken away?</font>

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,490
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go after them.</font>

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,800
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

29
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,030
<font color="yellow">I need to go somewhere.</font>

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,970
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,200
<font color="yellow">It was expected,</font>

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,570
<font color="yellow">but Mr Shin...</font>

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,370
<font color="yellow">arrested my team.</font>

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,100
<font color="yellow">He's becoming more and more childish.</font>

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
<font color="yellow">His subordinates are probably overly loyal to him,</font>

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,330
<font color="yellow">and he's probably enjoying it.</font>

37
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,230
<font color="yellow">I bet he's making more plans right now.</font>

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,970
<font color="yellow">You will face...</font>

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,300
<font color="yellow">mountain after mountain going forward.</font>

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,770
<font color="yellow">Can you handle it?</font>

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,870
<font color="yellow">I expected as much.</font>

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,330
<font color="yellow">Please look after yourself.</font>

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,500
<font color="yellow">Be careful,</font>

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,970
<font color="yellow">at least for Hae Kyung...</font>

45
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,800
<font color="yellow">and Soo Bin's sake.</font>

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,820
<font color="yellow">Spill it!</font>

47
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,210
<font color="yellow">My heart...</font>

48
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,590
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. Step outside.</font>

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,090
<font color="yellow">You'll do it yourself?</font>

50
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,470
<font color="yellow">I should handle evil villains like him myself.</font>

51
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,160
<font color="yellow">You're dead now.</font>

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
<font color="yellow">Mister. I mean, Sir... What do you mean, a villain?</font>

53
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,220
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me? I don't understand.</font>

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,760
<font color="yellow">I only run a small private loan business in my neighbourhood.</font>

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,060
<font color="yellow">I'm just a citizen...</font>

56
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,950
<font color="yellow">You look like a thug.</font>

57
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,000
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

58
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,990
<font color="yellow">How do I look like a thug?</font>

59
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,470
<font color="yellow">People always ask if I'm a hair stylist.</font>

60
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,500
<font color="yellow">Shut it!</font>

61
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,230
<font color="yellow">You scared me. I have a weak heart.</font>

62
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,170
<font color="yellow">I've been a prosecutor for over 20 years.</font>

63
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,900
<font color="yellow">I've seen many punks like you.</font>

64
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,100
<font color="yellow">You work with gangsters, don't you?</font>

65
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,050
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

66
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,700
<font color="yellow">I avoid alleys because I'm afraid of gangsters.</font>

67
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,600
<font color="yellow">The only fault I have is receiving a higher interest than banks...</font>

68
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,000
<font color="yellow">Hwang Ae Ra. You went to Detective Song and asked...</font>

69
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,170
<font color="yellow">for someone's personal information without police authorisation.</font>

70
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,030
<font color="yellow">- I...
-  What are you scheming?</font>

71
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,300
<font color="yellow">I was only looking for someone.</font>

72
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,370
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

73
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,170
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you.</font>

74
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,180
<font color="yellow">Why not? Are you sure you didn't sell that information...</font>

75
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,170
<font color="yellow">- for a voice phishing scam?
-  What?</font>

76
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,440
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? Would I do that?</font>

77
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,340
<font color="yellow">I'm so naive that I was scammed out of 3,000 dollars by them.</font>

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,270
<font color="yellow">I got a call three years ago,</font>

79
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,440
<font color="yellow">and they said something about personal information protection.</font>

80
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,480
<font color="yellow">So I switched accounts and lost it all.</font>

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,500
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

82
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,200
<font color="yellow">Your investigation is out of line.</font>

83
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,800
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep working with Joe Deul Ho?</font>

84
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,500
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

85
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,370
<font color="yellow">Did you drag me here because I work with Mr Joe?</font>

86
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,120
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,690
<font color="yellow">I can't stand to watch...</font>

88
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,170
<font color="yellow">your underlings acting out, now that you're the nominee for Minister.</font>

89
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,500
<font color="yellow">Is this revenge for last night?</font>

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,530
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

91
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,500
<font color="yellow">Are you getting ready for your confirmation hearing?</font>

92
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,090
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything.</font>

93
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,330
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

94
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,130
<font color="yellow">I'm already in it.</font>

95
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,140
<font color="yellow">I thought you may have too much assets for a minister,</font>

96
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,270
<font color="yellow">so I got rid of 30 million dollars for you.</font>

97
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,700
<font color="yellow">Sure. Thanks.</font>

98
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,780
<font color="yellow">But that's enough.</font>

99
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,240
<font color="yellow">My patience is running thin.</font>

100
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,100
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be patient.</font>

101
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
<font color="yellow">I won't...</font>

102
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,900
<font color="yellow">go easy on you either.</font>

103
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,240
<font color="yellow">Do you want to take this all the way?</font>

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,500
<font color="yellow">Do you want to try me?</font>

105
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,030
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

106
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,170
<font color="yellow">Let's take this all the way.</font>

107
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,600
<font color="yellow">That's why I started anyway.</font>

108
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,070
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

109
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,480
<font color="yellow">If you kick Deul Ho out and cut ties with him,</font>

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,070
<font color="yellow">I'll let go of all your acts of usury, illegal debt collection...</font>

111
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,130
<font color="yellow">and threatening businesses.</font>

112
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,930
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

113
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,870
<font color="yellow">I don't know what Mr Joe did wrong that you're doing this,</font>

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,760
<font color="yellow">but all I did was let him use my office.</font>

115
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,180
<font color="yellow">Then rot in jail for 4 or 5 years.</font>

116
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,230
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

117
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,410
<font color="yellow">You have your clients sign over the rights to their bodies, right?</font>

118
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,840
<font color="yellow">Are you filming a movie?</font>

119
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,230
<font color="yellow">I told you, I've never done that.</font>

120
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,490
<font color="yellow">- Good afternoon.
-  Get out!</font>

121
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,880
<font color="yellow">What are you doing down there?</font>

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,250
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sitting on the chair? Sit up here.</font>

123
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,030
<font color="yellow">- May I really?
-  Come and sit.</font>

124
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,200
<font color="yellow">I'm his attorney.</font>

125
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,150
<font color="yellow">Explain in detail just how he violated usury laws.</font>

126
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,750
<font color="yellow">What makes you so confident?</font>

127
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,700
<font color="yellow">What else? I believe in the laws of this nation.</font>

128
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,260
<font color="yellow">If you're upset that you couldn't eat the expensive cake last night...</font>

129
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,190
<font color="yellow">because I poured champagne on it,</font>

130
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,330
<font color="yellow">let them go and arrest me.</font>

131
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,280
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive you.</font>

132
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,940
<font color="yellow">I don't care. Do whatever you want.</font>

133
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,490
<font color="yellow">If you brought in law-abiding citizens,</font>

134
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,760
<font color="yellow">you should explain exactly what they did wrong.</font>

135
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,830
<font color="yellow">Or you should apologise for bringing them in improperly...</font>

136
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,900
<font color="yellow">and buy them ice cream or something!</font>

137
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,000
<font color="yellow">You lunatic.</font>

138
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,870
<font color="yellow">Lunatic? What?</font>

139
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,070
<font color="yellow">I'm losing my mind.</font>

140
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,000
<font color="yellow">I'm going crazy.</font>

141
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,430
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,530
<font color="yellow">Of course. This isn't my first time here.</font>

143
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,870
<font color="yellow">Sorry about that.</font>

144
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,170
<font color="yellow">I never knew I'd be back here.</font>

145
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,110
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since you were here. Do you want to sing a song?</font>

146
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,330
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,230
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

148
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,400
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

149
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,070
<font color="yellow">Did you order them to arrest...</font>

150
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,370
<font color="yellow">Deul Ho's employees?</font>

151
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,000
<font color="yellow">Do I look that bored to you?</font>

152
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,570
<font color="yellow">We have no reason to arrest them.</font>

153
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,170
<font color="yellow">I spoke with Mr Kim and told him to let them go.</font>

154
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,870
<font color="yellow">What do you plan to do with Deul Ho?</font>

155
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
<font color="yellow">Will you let him run around like that?</font>

156
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,600
<font color="yellow">The higher up you go,</font>

157
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,340
<font color="yellow">the more jealous people get...</font>

158
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,300
<font color="yellow">and try to attack you from left and right.</font>

159
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,470
<font color="yellow">If I were afraid of them, I wouldn't be where I am.</font>

160
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

161
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,330
<font color="yellow">do something bad...</font>

162
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,770
<font color="yellow">that Deul Ho is holding over your head?</font>

163
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,330
<font color="yellow">What could Deul Ho hold over my head?</font>

164
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,130
<font color="yellow">I saw Ms Myung Soon.</font>

165
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,170
<font color="yellow">You saw whom?</font>

166
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,840
<font color="yellow">Ms Myung Soon, who used to work at our house.</font>

167
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,800
<font color="yellow">Did Deul Ho bring her?</font>

168
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,230
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

169
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
<font color="yellow">He must've talked about my fake accounts.</font>

170
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,230
<font color="yellow">Is it true?</font>

171
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,510
<font color="yellow">Do you believe me or Deul Ho?</font>

172
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,450
<font color="yellow">I don't believe Deul Ho. I believe Ms Myung Soon.</font>

173
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,370
<font color="yellow">Don't let Deul Ho manipulate you. You know how he is.</font>

174
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,900
<font color="yellow">Fine. I used her account.</font>

175
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,450
<font color="yellow">But it isn't the type of money you think it is.</font>

176
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,870
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,230
<font color="yellow">- Don't you trust me?
-  No.</font>

178
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,270
<font color="yellow">I want to trust you, so please help me understand.</font>

179
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,070
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

180
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,670
<font color="yellow">Did you do something bad...</font>

181
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,970
<font color="yellow">that Deul Ho is holding over your head?</font>

182
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,700
<font color="yellow">Let's take this all the way.</font>

183
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,130
<font color="yellow">That's why I started anyway.</font>

184
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,170
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

185
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,200
<font color="yellow">Let's meet.</font>

186
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,540
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

187
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,570
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

188
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,840
<font color="yellow">You need to do something else for me.</font>

189
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
<font color="yellow">Just say the word.</font>

190
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,000
<font color="yellow">I need you to kill someone in a car accident.</font>

191
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,130
<font color="yellow">If it all goes well,</font>

192
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,840
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you're not dragged into it.</font>

193
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,000
<font color="yellow">Don't make any mistakes.</font>

194
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,950
<font color="yellow">Il Goo.</font>

195
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,070
<font color="yellow">Il Goo, are you okay? Are you okay?</font>

196
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,300
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

197
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,200
<font color="yellow">Help!</font>

198
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,030
<font color="yellow">Help!</font>

199
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

200
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

201
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that.</font>

202
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,770
<font color="yellow">What are you sorry for?</font>

203
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,100
<font color="yellow">This happened because of me.</font>

204
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,590
<font color="yellow">That prosecutor said he'd send me to prison...</font>

205
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,320
<font color="yellow">if I don't cut ties with you.</font>

206
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,700
<font color="yellow">I'll go to prison then.</font>

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
<font color="yellow">This is too dangerous.</font>

208
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,530
<font color="yellow">I've thought about it, and this won't work.</font>

209
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,970
<font color="yellow">Let's stop here.</font>

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,210
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

211
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,370
<font color="yellow">No, what's better is...</font>

212
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,400
<font color="yellow">for me to leave the office.</font>

213
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,330
<font color="yellow">Just a minute.</font>

214
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,650
<font color="yellow">Are you firing us?</font>

215
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,160
<font color="yellow">This is extremely dangerous.</font>

216
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,690
<font color="yellow">When wasn't it?</font>

217
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,320
<font color="yellow">Run to the roof of a building, steal a patient from a hospital...</font>

218
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
<font color="yellow">and I was almost killed by a hitman.</font>

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,190
<font color="yellow">- You know that.
-  Seriously.</font>

220
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,990
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

221
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,390
<font color="yellow">We need to work together...</font>

222
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,070
<font color="yellow">Don't be discouraged.</font>

223
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,890
<font color="yellow">We're following you because we believe in you.</font>

224
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,170
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

225
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,560
<font color="yellow">I can't leave.</font>

226
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,920
<font color="yellow">You can't move out of the office, got that?</font>

227
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,420
<font color="yellow">I can't leave. No.</font>

228
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,590
<font color="yellow">And I won't leave.</font>

229
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,870
<font color="yellow">I won't go either.</font>

230
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,900
<font color="yellow">Me, neither.</font>

231
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,020
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid you need to resign...</font>

232
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,330
<font color="yellow">from your current position as managing partner.</font>

233
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,870
<font color="yellow">It's not just my opinion.</font>

234
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,270
<font color="yellow">All the attorneys with a share in Geum San agree on this.</font>

235
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,600
<font color="yellow">Resign...</font>

236
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,470
<font color="yellow">for the sake of Geum San.</font>

237
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,130
<font color="yellow">- Please, resign from leadership.
-  Please, resign from leadership.</font>

238
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

239
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,490
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

240
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,600
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the office.</font>

241
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,400
<font color="yellow">Not yet. You can't.</font>

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,760
<font color="yellow">I can't just take this lying down.</font>

243
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,600
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting the partners one-on-one and talking to them.</font>

244
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,070
<font color="yellow">Leave it to me.</font>

245
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,280
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

246
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,430
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it won't,</font>

247
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,430
<font color="yellow">but I'll convince them somehow.</font>

248
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,230
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Hae Kyung.</font>

249
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,900
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you...</font>

250
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,230
<font color="yellow">being weak.</font>

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,860
<font color="yellow">It'll be impossible if the chief prosecutor...</font>

252
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,120
<font color="yellow">becomes Minister.</font>

253
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,130
<font color="yellow">We must take him down before then.</font>

254
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,390
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
-  Dae Soo and Eun Jo,</font>

255
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,960
<font color="yellow">move Ms Lee Myung Soon somewhere safe.</font>

256
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,690
<font color="yellow">I know someone who has an orange farm in Jeju Island.</font>

257
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,800
<font color="yellow">How about we move her there?</font>

258
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,200
<font color="yellow">You should avoid airports, train stations and bus terminals.</font>

259
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,790
<font color="yellow">I know someone who runs a bed-and-breakfast in Ganghwa Island.</font>

260
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,170
<font color="yellow">What about there?</font>

261
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,570
<font color="yellow">- Is it safe?
-  Nobody goes there.</font>

262
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,290
<font color="yellow">Okay. No one can know where Ms Lee Myung Soon is...</font>

263
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,500
<font color="yellow">before the confirmation hearing.</font>

264
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,050
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

265
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,790
<font color="yellow">Ae Ra, please work more on locating Shin Chul Soo.</font>

266
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,190
<font color="yellow">If you can bring him in, that'd be even better.</font>

267
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,390
<font color="yellow">- You can do it.
-  Okay.</font>

268
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,870
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
-  Go on.</font>

269
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,000
<font color="yellow">Where are we going this time?</font>

270
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,800
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. We're taking you somewhere very safe.</font>

271
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,970
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing by going with you.</font>

272
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,960
<font color="yellow">Please be patient.</font>

273
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,200
<font color="yellow">You just have to testify at Mr Shin's confirmation hearing.</font>

274
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,830
<font color="yellow">Testify?</font>

275
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,310
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything.</font>

276
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,040
<font color="yellow">Remember your account that you let him use?</font>

277
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,930
<font color="yellow">Just tell the truth about that, that's all.</font>

278
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,230
<font color="yellow">What happens to him...</font>

279
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,930
<font color="yellow">if I testify?</font>

280
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

281
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,070
<font color="yellow">The citizens will decide.</font>

282
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,070
<font color="yellow">(Mr Shin)</font>

283
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,050
<font color="yellow">Is it Mr Shin?</font>

284
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,580
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

285
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,060
<font color="yellow">Turn off your phone.</font>

286
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,170
<font color="yellow">They may track us.</font>

287
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,730
<font color="yellow">If you don't mind, may I hold onto it for a while?</font>

288
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,930
<font color="yellow">No, I'll turn it off.</font>

289
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,600
<font color="yellow">Your call is being forwarded...</font>

290
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,040
<font color="yellow">Please say a word about becoming the next minister.</font>

291
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not the minister yet. I'm merely a nominee.</font>

292
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,030
<font color="yellow">We still have the confirmation hearing, too.</font>

293
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,360
<font color="yellow">The citizens have high hopes for the prosecutor's office.</font>

294
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,500
<font color="yellow">Would you please say a word?</font>

295
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,280
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor's office...</font>

296
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,400
<font color="yellow">will thoroughly investigate and punish...</font>

297
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,980
<font color="yellow">people of the law who desecrate the law...</font>

298
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,200
<font color="yellow">because they are paid off or asked for a favour by the wealthy.</font>

299
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,770
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

300
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,710
<font color="yellow">After his confirmation hearing, Chief Prosecutor Shin Young Il...</font>

301
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,300
<font color="yellow">will be sworn in right away as Minister.</font>

302
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,070
<font color="yellow">Congressman Kim Seung Hyun will preside over the hearing.</font>

303
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,770
<font color="yellow">This is Chairman Jung Geun Moo's list of people he bribed.</font>

304
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,800
<font color="yellow">I understand how you feel,</font>

305
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,070
<font color="yellow">but this alone is insufficient...</font>

306
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,570
<font color="yellow">to prove the relationship between Shin Young Il...</font>

307
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,370
<font color="yellow">and Chairman Jung.</font>

308
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,270
<font color="yellow">Please call me...</font>

309
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,400
<font color="yellow">as a witness at the confirmation hearing.</font>

310
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,800
<font color="yellow">That is the only way to stop Mr Shin.</font>

311
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,040
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this?</font>

312
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,260
<font color="yellow">If things go wrong, you'd be handing him...</font>

313
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,970
<font color="yellow">an exemption instead.</font>

314
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,000
<font color="yellow">My political career may take a hit as well.</font>

315
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,000
<font color="yellow">I will obtain...</font>

316
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,330
<font color="yellow">fool-proof evidence and witnesses before the confirmation hearing.</font>

317
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,730
<font color="yellow">I've sent a car.</font>

318
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,670
<font color="yellow">Come out quietly.</font>

319
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,470
<font color="yellow">She said she wanted to take a walk. Where is she?</font>

320
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,830
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

321
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,130
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

322
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,330
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

323
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,330
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin is my saviour.</font>

324
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,200
<font color="yellow">- I can't testify.
-  Ma'am!</font>

325
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
-  Ma'am!</font>

326
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,670
<font color="yellow">- I'll live in hiding somewhere.
-  Ma'am!</font>

327
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,330
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

328
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,510
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

329
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,570
<font color="yellow">Ma'am!</font>

330
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,670
<font color="yellow">Ma'am!</font>

331
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,590
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

332
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,900
<font color="yellow">- Her phone was definitely off.
-  It was.</font>

333
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
<font color="yellow">How could he have tracked us?</font>

334
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,890
<font color="yellow">How did he know she was there?</font>

335
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,380
<font color="yellow">- You weren't followed?
-  No. I'm sure of it.</font>

336
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,290
<font color="yellow">You should've stuck to her like glue.</font>

337
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,560
<font color="yellow">I need to eat. I went grocery...</font>

338
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,910
<font color="yellow">Were you on vacation?</font>

339
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,080
<font color="yellow">- No, I...
-  I'm sorry.</font>

340
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,580
<font color="yellow">- We made a mistake.
-  I was gone for a minute.</font>

341
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,540
<font color="yellow">That Mr Shin is scary.</font>

342
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,780
<font color="yellow">How did he find her there?</font>

343
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,160
<font color="yellow">Was anyone here when you left?</font>

344
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,220
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  No.</font>

345
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,060
<font color="yellow">- Was anyone by Eun Jo's place?
-  No.</font>

346
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,560
<font color="yellow">- Were you tailed?
-  No.</font>

347
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,470
<font color="yellow">I was very careful.</font>

348
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,130
<font color="yellow">There was no one.</font>

349
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,600
<font color="yellow">How did he know?</font>

350
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
<font color="yellow">Mr Joe.</font>

351
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
<font color="yellow">A bug.</font>

352
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,220
<font color="yellow">Dae Soo, you messed up.</font>

353
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,760
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you people?</font>

354
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It was all my fault. I'm so sorry.</font>

355
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,090
<font color="yellow">She was an important witness.</font>

356
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,430
<font color="yellow">It was your fault.</font>

357
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,430
<font color="yellow">This is so hard.</font>

358
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,540
<font color="yellow">This is too hard.</font>

359
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,150
<font color="yellow">Hello? Is this Min Joo Gwan?</font>

360
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,070
<font color="yellow">Their deliveries take too long.</font>

361
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,390
<font color="yellow">Order from somewhere else.</font>

362
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,550
<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

363
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,490
<font color="yellow">Why is life so hard?</font>

364
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,540
<font color="yellow">That's life.</font>

365
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,600
<font color="yellow">When is the food coming?</font>

366
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

367
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,930
<font color="yellow">Why did you say that to Ji Wook?</font>

368
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,570
<font color="yellow">I wasn't thinking.</font>

369
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,750
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have listened to that lawyer, Mr Joe.</font>

370
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,770
<font color="yellow">Three years ago,</font>

371
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,770
<font color="yellow">he lost his job as a prosecutor for taking a bribe.</font>

372
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,670
<font color="yellow">He has a grudge against me.</font>

373
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,130
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

374
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,730
<font color="yellow">Why don't you leave the country for a short while?</font>

375
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,900
<font color="yellow">It won't take long.</font>

376
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,570
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you can return once things quiet down.</font>

377
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,400
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

378
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,170
<font color="yellow">I made sure your oldest son will get a promotion this fall.</font>

379
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sir.</font>

380
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

381
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,830
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

382
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,730
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin is not an easy adversary.</font>

383
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,770
<font color="yellow">I have the slush fund ledger, but that is not enough.</font>

384
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,930
<font color="yellow">The sole witness for his account under a borrowed name...</font>

385
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,330
<font color="yellow">has disappeared.</font>

386
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,040
<font color="yellow">Chairman Jung is unconscious,</font>

387
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,730
<font color="yellow">and it'll be difficult to find any additional evidence.</font>

388
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,970
<font color="yellow">The confirmation hearing is drawing near.</font>

389
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,980
<font color="yellow">Seoul Central District Court.</font>

390
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,400

391
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,830
<font color="yellow">Defendant Jang Shin Woo,</font>

392
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,220
<font color="yellow">you are found guilty of tax evasion,</font>

<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

396
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,330
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

397
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,830
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

398
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,670
<font color="yellow">The doctor says I need my rest.</font>

399
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,300
<font color="yellow">I'll rest soundly in prison.</font>

400
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't help.</font>

401
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,770
<font color="yellow">No,</font>

402
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,300
<font color="yellow">it's what my dad wanted.</font>

403
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,000
<font color="yellow">How are things going for the confirmation hearing?</font>

404
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
<font color="yellow">I'm working on it.</font>

405
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,650
<font color="yellow">I need to make sure he doesn't get confirmed.</font>

406
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,700
<font color="yellow">Do you have a sure-fire plan?</font>

407
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,870
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

408
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,770
<font color="yellow">Then what will you do?</font>

409
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,900
<font color="yellow">I'll have to figure something out,</font>

410
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,670
<font color="yellow">Whatever happens,</font>

411
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,100
<font color="yellow">be careful.</font>

412
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,030
<font color="yellow">Hold it.</font>

413
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,900
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

414
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,870
<font color="yellow">I just came.</font>

415
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,800
<font color="yellow">I thought he'd be lonely,</font>

416
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,300
<font color="yellow">so I figured I'd keep him company.</font>

417
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,030
<font color="yellow">He cant express himself yet.</font>

418
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

419
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not here to do anything,</font>

420
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,430
<font color="yellow">so don't worry.</font>

421
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,700
<font color="yellow">Chairman Jung.</font>

422
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,570
<font color="yellow">Do you recognise me?</font>

423
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,070
<font color="yellow">It's me, Joe Deul Ho.</font>

424
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
<font color="yellow">Seeing you lying there like that...</font>

425
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,370
<font color="yellow">This isn't you.</font>

426
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,030
<font color="yellow">Aren't you lonely and frustrated?</font>

427
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,070
<font color="yellow">I came because I'm frustrated.</font>

428
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,430
<font color="yellow">You ran the world...</font>

429
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,670
<font color="yellow">like it was your toy, with your slush fund and lobbying.</font>

430
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,550
<font color="yellow">Why are you lying there?</font>

431
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,870
<font color="yellow">I'm bored because you're just lying there.</font>

432
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,430
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin is succeeding and going full speed ahead.</font>

433
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,110
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it make you angry to just lie there?</font>

434
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,470
<font color="yellow">Aren't you angry?</font>

435
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,560
<font color="yellow">Aren't you angry that Mr Shin...</font>

436
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,480
<font color="yellow">stabbed you in the back?</font>

437
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,300
<font color="yellow">If you're angry, get up and say something.</font>

438
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,150
<font color="yellow">"I will not go down like this!"</font>

439
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,520
<font color="yellow">"I refuse to go down like this!"</font>

440
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,830
<font color="yellow">Or even yell at me and tell me to get out!</font>

441
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,300
<font color="yellow">You also want me...</font>

442
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,230
<font color="yellow">to take Mr Shin down, don't you?</font>

443
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,370
<font color="yellow">We really don't have much time.</font>

444
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,700
<font color="yellow">Conclusive evidence.</font>

445
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
<font color="yellow">I need conclusive evidence.</font>

446
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,700
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin will deny...</font>

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,100
<font color="yellow">everything during the confirmation hearing.</font>

448
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,500
<font color="yellow">I need conclusive evidence.</font>

449
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,930
<font color="yellow">I must find conclusive evidence.</font>

450
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,270
<font color="yellow">Il Goo gave me this key just before he died.</font>

452
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,170

453
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,730
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

454
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,570
<font color="yellow">there is no way for me to find out where the locker...</font>

455
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,470
<font color="yellow">for this key is.</font>

456
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,980
<font color="yellow">Hi, Soo Bin.</font>

457
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,030
<font color="yellow">Daddy.</font>

458
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,070
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I've been too busy to come see you. Sorry.</font>

459
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,600
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

460
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,770
<font color="yellow">I know you and Mummy are busy.</font>

461
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,270
<font color="yellow">How have you been? Have you been busy?</font>

462
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,420
<font color="yellow">Yes. I went to school,</font>

463
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,580
<font color="yellow">then piano school, art school...</font>

464
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,570
<font color="yellow">and even English school.</font>

465

<font color="yellow">Why do you have so many classes?</font>

466
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,800
<font color="yellow">Today is my busiest day.</font>

467
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,770
<font color="yellow">That's still too many.</font>

468
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,860
<font color="yellow">Should I ask Mummy to send you to just one academy from now on?</font>

469
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,200
<font color="yellow">No, I like it. It's fun.</font>

470
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,900
<font color="yellow">You should rest on your day off.</font>

471
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,730
<font color="yellow">I'm swamped with cases.</font>

472
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,510
<font color="yellow">I'm super busy.</font>

473
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,520
<font color="yellow">I'm going to become really busy, too.</font>

474
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,040
<font color="yellow">With that? Playing?</font>

475
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,970
<font color="yellow">I registered for an academy to take my GED.</font>

476
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,000
<font color="yellow">- Do you mean it?
-  I mean it.</font>

477
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,210
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

478
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,110
<font color="yellow">- Guess what the academy is called.
-  What?</font>

479
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,770
<font color="yellow">Il Goo Academy.</font>

480
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,860
<font color="yellow">Are you joking with me? I'm busy.</font>

481
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,350
<font color="yellow">I mean it. It's in Noyrangjin.</font>

482
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,930
<font color="yellow">This is fate.</font>

483
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,850
<font color="yellow">You're joking.</font>

484
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,670
<font color="yellow">You passed the bar after taking the GED.</font>

485
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,830
<font color="yellow">You did it, so why can't I?</font>

486
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,350
<font color="yellow">Fine. Study hard and pass first.</font>

487
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,700
<font color="yellow">If you pass, I'll do anything you ask.</font>

488
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,530
<font color="yellow">Do you mean it?</font>

489
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,600
<font color="yellow">Daddy.</font>

490
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,900
<font color="yellow">- Daddy!
-  Yes, Soo Bin.</font>

491
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,100
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I'm really busy now, so let me call you back.</font>

497
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,300
<font color="yellow">I heard you'll be a witness at the hearing tomorrow.</font>

498
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,470
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

499
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,670
<font color="yellow">Does that concern you?</font>

500
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,830
<font color="yellow">If you cancel your presence,</font>

501
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,230
<font color="yellow">I'll reduce the sentence of Mr Jang.</font>

502

<font color="yellow">One who has committed a crime...</font>

504

<font color="yellow">And...</font>

510
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,770
<font color="yellow">you will regret it.</font>

511
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,830
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to prove anything.</font>

512
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,600
<font color="yellow">You'll end up in court on charges of defamation.</font>

513

<font color="yellow">Do you remember Kang Il Goo?</font>

514
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,730
<font color="yellow">He's my little brother from the orphanage.</font>

515
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,600
<font color="yellow">You were going to put him in prison...</font>

516

<font color="yellow">on Michael Jung's behalf.</font>

517
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
<font color="yellow">What about him?</font>

518
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,400
<font color="yellow">I was just reminded of him...</font>

519
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,870
<font color="yellow">all of a sudden.</font>

520
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,800
<font color="yellow">Isn't there anything you'd like to tell me...</font>

521
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,600
<font color="yellow">regarding Kang Il Goo?</font>

522
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,440
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you'd like to confess?</font>

523
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,500
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Let's talk in person.</font>

524
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,800
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

525
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,940
<font color="yellow">Today is the day.</font>

526
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,330
<font color="yellow">Get the job done.</font>

527
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,370
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin...</font>

528
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,570
<font color="yellow">will push ahead his plan until the very last moment.</font>

529
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:21,030
<font color="yellow">The more he rushes, the easier it will be to trip him over.</font>

530
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,070
<font color="yellow">However, if I can't trip him,</font>

531
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,940
<font color="yellow">I might be the one who's tripped.</font>

532
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,530
<font color="yellow">Nonetheless, I want to meet him...</font>

533
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,770
<font color="yellow">and ask him...</font>

534
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,700
<font color="yellow">why he had to do it...</font>

535
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,670
<font color="yellow">and if it was really necessary.</font>

536
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,860
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dae Soo.</font>

537
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,500
<font color="yellow">Mr Joe, won't you come out and drink with us? We're all out.</font>

538
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,270
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I'm a bit busy at the moment.</font>

539
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,750
<font color="yellow">Have fun.</font>

540
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,090
<font color="yellow">We're also busy ourselves.</font>

541
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,100
<font color="yellow">Come on. We haven't had fun in a while. Come out.</font>

542
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,170

547
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,470
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

548
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,860
<font color="yellow">Are you saying your goodbyes or something?</font>

549
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,170
<font color="yellow">- Where is he going?
-  I don't know.</font>

550
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,900
<font color="yellow">Tell everyone that I'm grateful for all of them.</font>

551
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,970
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you.</font>

552
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,290
<font color="yellow">He wants me to tell you both that he's grateful.</font>

553
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,690
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? Come quickly. Right now.</font>

554
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,790
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

555
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,010
<font color="yellow">You heard him, right?</font>

556
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm really quite busy.</font>

557
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,500
<font color="yellow">Have a good time.</font>

558
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,760
<font color="yellow">All right. Call me if you change your mind.</font>

559
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,600
<font color="yellow">We're drinking at a bar near the office.</font>

560
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,800
<font color="yellow">I really have no idea...</font>

561
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,200
<font color="yellow">what Mr Shin is...</font>

562
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,870
<font color="yellow">about to do.</font>

563
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,330
<font color="yellow">Do you think I have the ledger...</font>

564
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,320
<font color="yellow">or not?</font>

565
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,330
<font color="yellow">If you have it,</font>

566
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,900
<font color="yellow">you're going to die.</font>

567
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
<font color="yellow">Do you want to take this all the way?</font>

568
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,230
<font color="yellow">Do you want to try me?</font>

569
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,210
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

570
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,270
<font color="yellow">Hae Kyung, it's me.</font>

571
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,900
<font color="yellow">How are the preparations going for tomorrow?</font>

572
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,200
<font color="yellow">I'm still preparing for it.</font>

573
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600

576
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,100
<font color="yellow">you should never...</font>

577
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,830
<font color="yellow">be weak.</font>

578
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,000
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself first.</font>

579
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,470
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

580
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,490
<font color="yellow">Daddy!</font>

<font color="yellow">Soo Bin.</font>

582
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,670
<font color="yellow">Daddy, can we go to an amusement park?</font>

583
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,700
<font color="yellow">I really want to go with you.</font>

584
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,030
<font color="yellow">I really want to go with you as well.</font>

585
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,440
<font color="yellow">Let's go to an amusement park...</font>

586
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,500
<font color="yellow">and ride a pirate ship.</font>

587
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,770
<font color="yellow">Let's ride all the rides.</font>

588
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,470
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

589
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,130
<font color="yellow">I'm so excited!</font>

590
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,920
<font color="yellow">You should finish all your homework before then,</font>

591
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,700
<font color="yellow">so that Mum won't get mad.</font>

592
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,070
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm a good girl nowadays.</font>

593
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,440
<font color="yellow">You are a good girl.</font>

594
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,700
<font color="yellow">You're the best, Soo Bin.</font>

595
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,700
<font color="yellow">You need to listen to Mum, all right?</font>

596
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,530
<font color="yellow">Dad, you have to keep your promise, okay?</font>

597
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,070
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

598
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,670
<font color="yellow">I will keep my promise no matter what.</font>

599
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,270
<font color="yellow">Help! Help! Il Goo!</font>

600
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry!</font>

601
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,900
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

602
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,870
<font color="yellow">Leave the country for a while.</font>

603
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,660
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I do that whenever I get drunk.</font>

604
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,910
<font color="yellow">I woke up, and I was at your place.</font>

605
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,730
<font color="yellow">I slept well thanks to you.</font>

606
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,440
<font color="yellow">Today is finally Mr Shin's confirmation hearing.</font>

607
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,330
<font color="yellow">We'll do fine.</font>

608
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,770
<font color="yellow">Why am I so nervous and anxious?</font>

609
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,540
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because Mr Joe is going to testify.</font>

610
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,370
<font color="yellow">He wasn't answering his phone this morning.</font>

611
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,480
<font color="yellow">He didn't answer my call, either.</font>

612
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,420
<font color="yellow">- Should I try him again now?
-  Yes.</font>

613
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,710
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

614
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,600
<font color="yellow">He's probably concentrating on doing something big.</font>

615
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,590
<font color="yellow">Bring this to him.</font>

616
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,970
<font color="yellow">Let's split this.</font>

617
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,830
<font color="yellow">Let's be strong. Let's eat and be strong.</font>

618
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,100
<font color="yellow">(Witness)</font>

619
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,100
<font color="yellow">We will now begin...</font>

620
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,440
<font color="yellow">the confirmation hearing...</font>

621
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,930
<font color="yellow">of Minister nominee,</font>

622
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,730
<font color="yellow">Shin Young Il, the present Chief Prosecutor.</font>

623
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,170
<font color="yellow">First, we will hear Shin Young Il's speech.</font>

624
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,500
<font color="yellow">I am Shin Young Il, the chief prosecutor of Seoul Central.</font>

625
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,230
<font color="yellow">It is an honour for me to be here...</font>

626
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,570
<font color="yellow">as the nominee for the position of Minister.</font>

627
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,170
<font color="yellow">For the past 30 years,</font>

628
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,970
<font color="yellow">I've fought against corruption and brought about...</font>

629
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,440
<font color="yellow">justice in society as a prosecutor,</font>

630
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,600
<font color="yellow">and for that, I am proud of myself.</font>

631
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,270
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

632
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,750
<font color="yellow">do my best to ensure the people of this nation...</font>

633
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,170
<font color="yellow">can trust in the prosecutors.</font>

634
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,970
<font color="yellow">Did you know that there are rumours saying you received sponsorship...</font>

635
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,830
<font color="yellow">from Chairman Jung Geun Moo since you were a junior prosecutor?</font>

636
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,500
<font color="yellow">Some even call you "Chairman Jang's man".</font>

637
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,270
<font color="yellow">I've never heard that before.</font>

638
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,080
<font color="yellow">What do you think about the assertions...</font>

639
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,590
<font color="yellow">that you took bribes from Chairman Jung and covered up...</font>

640
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,070
<font color="yellow">Daehwa's various illegal activities?</font>

641
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,930
<font color="yellow">During my 30 years as a prosecutor,</font>

642
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,900
<font color="yellow">I did my best and did nothing that I would be ashamed of.</font>

643
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,870
<font color="yellow">I did nothing illegal.</font>

644
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,300
<font color="yellow">Where is the witness, Joe Deul Ho?</font>

645
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,300
<font color="yellow">Did he not show?</font>

646
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,600
<font color="yellow">He's not here yet.</font>

647
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,670
<font color="yellow">Since the witness did not appear,</font>

648
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,760
<font color="yellow">we will have to...</font>

649
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,400
<font color="yellow">The witness is right here!</font>

650
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,600
<font color="yellow">The witness is right here.</font>

651
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,770
<font color="yellow">Here I am.</font>

652
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:22,970
<font color="yellow">Joe Deul Ho.</font>

653
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,990
<font color="yellow">You claimed you could prove the joint corruption between...</font>

654
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,470
<font color="yellow">the nominee and Daehwa, correct?</font>

655
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,030
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

656
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,050
<font color="yellow">What I have in my hand...</font>

657
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,830
<font color="yellow">is the list of people Jung Geun Moo paid...</font>

658
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,070
<font color="yellow">with his slush fund.</font>

659
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,200
<font color="yellow">This proof that Chairman Jung Geun Moo...</font>

660
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,000
<font color="yellow">had been lobbying people in politics and the judicial system.</font>

661
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,500
<font color="yellow">Let's look at the screen.</font>

662
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,200
<font color="yellow">Lee Myung Soon, Shin Chul Soo, Yoon Hyun Jong.</font>

663
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,430
<font color="yellow">As you can see,</font>

664
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,400
<font color="yellow">these three names are repeated over and over.</font>

665
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,270
<font color="yellow">These three people...</font>

666
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,520
<font color="yellow">are not in politics...</font>

667
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,700
<font color="yellow">or anywhere in the judicial system.</font>

668
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,500
<font color="yellow">These people...</font>

669
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,930
<font color="yellow">all have personal relationships with the nominee, Shin Young Il.</font>

670
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,840
<font color="yellow">More specifically,</font>

671
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,330
<font color="yellow">they are people who lent Shin Young Il...</font>

672
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,980
<font color="yellow">their names to make bank accounts.</font>

673
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,310
<font color="yellow">Shin Young Il,</font>

674
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,570
<font color="yellow">do you have anything to say about this assertion?</font>

675
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,400
<font color="yellow">I don't know them.</font>

676
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,290
<font color="yellow">If there is any doubt,</font>

677
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,130
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the prosecutor's office will investigate thoroughly.</font>

678
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,930
<font color="yellow">Furthermore, Joe Deul Ho...</font>

679
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,100
<font color="yellow">was dishonourably terminated from his position as a prosecutor...</font>

680
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,540
<font color="yellow">for receiving a bribe from Chairman Jung Geun Moo.</font>

681
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,930
<font color="yellow">I prosecuted Joe Deul Ho back then...</font>

682
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
<font color="yellow">for taking a bribe.</font>

683
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,700
<font color="yellow">I believe that is why he is making...</font>

684
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,500
<font color="yellow">these unfounded accusations.</font>

685
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,840
<font color="yellow">Joe Deul Ho.</font>

686
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,930
<font color="yellow">Can you prove your assertions?</font>

687
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,070
<font color="yellow">If you cannot,</font>

688
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,870
<font color="yellow">you will be punished for perjury.</font>

689
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:10,970
<font color="yellow">Congressman Kim,</font>

690
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,300
<font color="yellow">and honorable members,</font>

691
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,830
<font color="yellow">I'd like to call another witness...</font>

692
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,130
<font color="yellow">in order to prove my assertions.</font>

693
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,370
<font color="yellow">Please permit it.</font>

694
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,970
<font color="yellow">As the presiding officer, I will permit it.</font>

695
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,190
<font color="yellow">The witness is waiting right outside.</font>

696
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,070
<font color="yellow">- I will bring the person in.
-  Okay.</font>

697
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,430
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

698
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,870
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Chairman Jung?</font>

699
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

700
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,470
<font color="yellow">really get Chairman Jung to testify?</font>

701
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,570
<font color="yellow">Yes, but I will proceed...</font>

702
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,030
<font color="yellow">with the testimony as his legal agent.</font>

703
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,970
<font color="yellow">Jung Geun Moo.</font>

704
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,600
<font color="yellow">Are you able to swear in as a witness?</font>

705
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,100
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

706
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,600
<font color="yellow">Jung Geun Moo recently had brain surgery for a brain aneurysm.</font>

707
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,560
<font color="yellow">He is incapacitated both mentally and physically.</font>

708
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,830
<font color="yellow">That is why the charges against him have been dropped.</font>

709
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,930
<font color="yellow">I question whether or not he can testify properly.</font>

710
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,530
<font color="yellow">This is an evaluation from the medical association.</font>

711
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,400
<font color="yellow">It says Jung Geun Moo...</font>

712
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,930
<font color="yellow">has a slight handicap in speaking,</font>

713
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,830
<font color="yellow">but his mental state is perfectly sound.</font>

714
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,030
<font color="yellow">This evaluation is trustworthy and dependable.</font>

715
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,900
<font color="yellow">Honourable Sir,</font>

716
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,500
<font color="yellow">please permit me to assist Chairman Jung Geun Moo...</font>

717
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,330
<font color="yellow">with his testimony as his legal agent.</font>

718
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,430
<font color="yellow">Do you approve?</font>

719
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,830
<font color="yellow">I will permit it.</font>

720
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,030
<font color="yellow">Mr Jung,</font>

721
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,940
<font color="yellow">do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...</font>

722
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,600
<font color="yellow">and nothing but the truth.</font>

723
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,830
<font color="yellow">Are you aware that perjury will be punishable under the law?</font>

724
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,580
<font color="yellow">You may nod...</font>

725
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,130
<font color="yellow">or make other movements.</font>

726
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,070
<font color="yellow">If what I say is true,</font>

727
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,470
<font color="yellow">please blink once.</font>

728
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,800
<font color="yellow">If I am wrong, please blink multiple times.</font>

729
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,000
<font color="yellow">You also want me...</font>

730
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,300
<font color="yellow">to take Mr Shin down, don't you?</font>

731
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,100
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I'm saying?</font>

732
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,030
<font color="yellow">What's my name?</font>

733
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,070
<font color="yellow">Is my name Jung Geun Moo?</font>

734
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,530
<font color="yellow">Will you go with me...</font>

735
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,470
<font color="yellow">to the confirmation hearing?</font>

736
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,790
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go with me...</font>

737
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,500
<font color="yellow">and strip the mask off of Mr Shin and destroy him?</font>

738
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:36,030
<font color="yellow">Does 2 plus 2 equal 36?</font>

739
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

740
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:41,970
<font color="yellow">Jung Geun Moo.</font>

741
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,600
<font color="yellow">Have you ever bribed the nominee, Shin Young Il?</font>

742
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,840
<font color="yellow">Jung Geun Moo, have you bribed the nominee, Shin Young Il...</font>

743
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,000
<font color="yellow">by depositing money...</font>

744
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,970
<font color="yellow">into those accounts under borrowed names?</font>

745
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,870
<font color="yellow">Nominee. Do you have anything to say in response...</font>

746
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
<font color="yellow">to the witness' statement?</font>

747
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,770
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

748
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,330
<font color="yellow">Jung Geun Moo...</font>

749
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,470
<font color="yellow">is resentful of me...</font>

750
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,330
<font color="yellow">since I arrested him.</font>

751
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,070
<font color="yellow">That is why he is lying under oath.</font>

752
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:41,970
<font color="yellow">Three years ago,</font>

753
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,230
<font color="yellow">the witness' son, Michael Jung, caused a car accident...</font>

754
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:49,330
<font color="yellow">and set fire to the body of the homeless man...</font>

755
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,700
<font color="yellow">who died in the accident.</font>

756
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,730
<font color="yellow">Back then,</font>

757
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,470
<font color="yellow">the witness asked the nominee,</font>

758
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:59,230
<font color="yellow">who was the chief prosecutor, to bury the case.</font>

759
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,470
<font color="yellow">In return, he deposited a million dollars...</font>

760
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,800
<font color="yellow">into the account under a borrowed name.</font>

761
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,530
<font color="yellow">Do you admit...</font>

762
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,770
<font color="yellow">this is true?</font>

763
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,870
<font color="yellow">Shin Young Il...</font>

764
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,300
<font color="yellow">instructed me,</font>

765
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,670
<font color="yellow">a prosecutor a the time, to bury the case.</font>

766
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,770
<font color="yellow">I withdrew the case...</font>

767
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,030
<font color="yellow">and buried it.</font>

768
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,470
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

769
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:33,700
<font color="yellow">The witness is making statements that cannot be substantiated...</font>

770
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,110
<font color="yellow">and is making a mockery of the hearing.</font>

771
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,970
<font color="yellow">I'll prove it now.</font>

772
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:41,030
<font color="yellow">Plus, I did not make a mockery of the confirmation hearing.</font>

773
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,600
<font color="yellow">I have a video...</font>

774
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,330
<font color="yellow">which I'd like to submit.</font>

775
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:49,570
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

776
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,600
<font color="yellow">Take my hand.</font>

777
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,130
<font color="yellow">It's the security video of Michael Jung.</font>

778
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

779
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,070
<font color="yellow">for giving it to you now.</font>

780
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,800
<font color="yellow">As you can see, the witness' testimony is true.</font>

781
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,930
<font color="yellow">I want to make it clear that Shin Young Il,</font>

782
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,900
<font color="yellow">who hid and manipulated the truth and took money for it,</font>

783
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,470
<font color="yellow">should not be appointed Minister,</font>

784
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,930
<font color="yellow">but should be arrested instead!</font>

785
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,270
<font color="yellow">Shin Young Il.</font>

786
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:15,670
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything to say?</font>

787
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,170
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

788
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,530
<font color="yellow">slander and...</font>

789
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
<font color="yellow">a conspiracy against me.</font>

790
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,700
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

791
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,570
<font color="yellow">a serious challenge...</font>

792
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,870
<font color="yellow">against not only me,</font>

793
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,700
<font color="yellow">but against prosecutors as a whole.</font>

794
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,070
<font color="yellow">I will take legal recourse...</font>

795
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,030
<font color="yellow">against both Chairman Jung Geun Moo...</font>

796
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,330
<font color="yellow">and Joe Deul Ho.</font>

797
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,900
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

798
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,900
<font color="yellow">Let's watch the bonus video.</font>

799
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,500
<font color="yellow">After that, you can take me to court.</font>

800
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,470
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat.
-  Okay.</font>

801
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,800
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

802
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,900
<font color="yellow">That kid, Il Goo...</font>

803
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,330
<font color="yellow">is a big headache.</font>

804
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,590
<font color="yellow">Is he still calling?</font>

805
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:23,870
<font color="yellow">Several times a day.</font>

806
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,500
<font color="yellow">Didn't you pay him to go to prison in my son's place?</font>

807
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,830
<font color="yellow">He didn't even go to prison,</font>

808
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,500
<font color="yellow">so why should I give money to his orphanage?</font>

809
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,470
<font color="yellow">He didn't have a proper upbringing, so he must not be trustworthy.</font>

810
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,570
<font color="yellow">Don't you think we should do something about it?</font>

811
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,600
<font color="yellow">He's threatening...</font>

812
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,470
<font color="yellow">to tell the media if I don't pay.</font>

813
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,600
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't that put you in a pickle?</font>

814
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,710
<font color="yellow">We should make sure...</font>

815
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,860
<font color="yellow">we don't have any problems in the future.</font>

816
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,330
<font color="yellow">Can you take care of it?</font>

817
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,100
<font color="yellow">We'll fake a car accident.</font>

818
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,600
<font color="yellow">Would you take care of it?</font>

819
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,300
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a solid million this time.</font>

820
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,430
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

821
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,130
<font color="yellow">- Is that real?
-  Oh, my.</font>
