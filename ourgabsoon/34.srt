00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:05,026
<font color="yellow">BioskopKeren</font>

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,470
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it was your ex-wife's restaurant.</font>

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,240
<font color="yellow">I didn't know, either.</font>

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,670
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking about that.</font>

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
<font color="yellow">Okay. You should go home.</font>

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,040
<font color="yellow">Goodbye. I'll text you before I go to bed.</font>

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,370
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,100
<font color="yellow">I thought you had a gathering with your coworkers.</font>

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,300
<font color="yellow">Did you even lie to me to meet him?</font>

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,400
<font color="yellow">I met him briefly after the party.</font>

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
<font color="yellow">Do you think this makes sense?</font>

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,200
<font color="yellow">I already told you not to meet her. You should listen to me.</font>

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,510
<font color="yellow">You're already divorced. Why won't you let her go?</font>

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,270
<font color="yellow">It's not like that. Let's go, Mum. You should go, too.</font>

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,500
<font color="yellow">You already gave her a hard time when you lived together.</font>

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,970
<font color="yellow">If you know that, you should let go of her at least now.</font>

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,270
<font color="yellow">Because you're broke and there is no one to do the housework,</font>

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,870
<font color="yellow">are you trying to use her to take care of your kids?</font>

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,540
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,700
<font color="yellow">This just isn't right. Don't you have any conscience?</font>

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Mum. You should go.</font>

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,870
<font color="yellow">- Just go. - You idiot.</font>

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,040
<font color="yellow">He's doing this because he thinks you're easy.</font>

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,740
<font color="yellow">You should know better than this.</font>

26
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,500
<font color="yellow">Why would you meet another man when Ddol Ee's dad is back?</font>

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,770
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it. You're not a teenager, you know.</font>

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,470
<font color="yellow">You are 40 years old already,</font>

29
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,000
<font color="yellow">but you are not mature at all.</font>

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,170
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell which is the right choice for you?</font>

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,700
<font color="yellow">Why would you get on a bus with a flat tire?</font>

32
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,840
<font color="yellow">You should be jumping out of it.</font>

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,700
<font color="yellow">Who got on a bus with a flat tire?</font>

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,070
<font color="yellow">Who else could it be? It's your oldest daughter.</font>

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,370
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik...</font>

36
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,870
<font color="yellow">I mean, Mr Jo was with her, and they got caught by Nae Shim.</font>

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,300
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,600
<font color="yellow">She is completely out of her mind.</font>

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,540
<font color="yellow">He's only luring her because he needs someone by his side.</font>

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,270
<font color="yellow">You should meet him yourself and tell him to stop.</font>

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,100
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,770
<font color="yellow">They're both grown-ups. Scolding them won't solve anything.</font>

43
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,400
<font color="yellow">They're madly in love.</font>

44
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,800
<font color="yellow">Are you really in love with him?</font>

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,800
<font color="yellow">She went out to meet him in the middle of night.</font>

46
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,300
<font color="yellow">She even lied to us to meet him. That says it all.</font>

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,610
<font color="yellow">Tell me honestly about how you feel.</font>

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,110
<font color="yellow">You guys got a divorce.</font>

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you have a good reason behind seeing him.</font>

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,140
<font color="yellow">You don't date someone because there's a reason.</font>

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,770
<font color="yellow">It's your emotion that matters.</font>

52
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,140
<font color="yellow">You see them because of your feelings.</font>

53
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,800
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense.</font>

54
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,940
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be him?</font>

55
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,240
<font color="yellow">Tell us frankly.</font>

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,040
<font color="yellow">Do you really have feelings for him?</font>

57
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,170
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - See? I told you so.</font>

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,110
<font color="yellow">I didn't know him that well when we lived together.</font>

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,740
<font color="yellow">I didn't know anything about him and didn't have feelings for him.</font>

60
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,770
<font color="yellow">But after I got divorced with him...</font>

61
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,140
<font color="yellow">Did you fall in love with him after you got divorced?</font>

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,940
<font color="yellow">Please let me talk.</font>

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,540
<font color="yellow">I just recently realised that he's a really nice guy.</font>

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,740
<font color="yellow">You are crazy.</font>

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,940
<font color="yellow">What a load of nonsense.</font>

66
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,300
<font color="yellow">What kind of a nice person would give you such a hard time?</font>

67
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,770
<font color="yellow">You used to tell me that he's nice and that I should go back to him.</font>

68
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,070
<font color="yellow">The situation is different now.</font>

69
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,840
<font color="yellow">What's different? He's still the same person.</font>

70
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,540
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have any money.</font>

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,300
<font color="yellow">You grew old, but you know nothing about life.</font>

72
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,300
<font color="yellow">You don't know how precious money is.</font>

73
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,500
<font color="yellow">You only remember things that are beneficial to you.</font>

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,470
<font color="yellow">That's what she is good at.</font>

75
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,240
<font color="yellow">So what is your plan?</font>

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,140
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live with him?</font>

77
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,470
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

78
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,570
<font color="yellow">Please leave this up to me. I'll handle it on my own.</font>

79
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,300
<font color="yellow">You must be out of your mind.</font>

80
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,940
<font color="yellow">Why don't you punish her?</font>

81
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,970
<font color="yellow">I also think Geum Sik is a nice person.</font>

82
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,770
<font color="yellow">You are making it worse.</font>

83
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,070
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

84
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,340
<font color="yellow">you already ended things by getting a divorce.</font>

85
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,140
<font color="yellow">You don't have kids between you.</font>

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
<font color="yellow">And each of you have your own kids to take care of.</font>

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,540
<font color="yellow">You already tried living with him.</font>

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,470
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't meet him without having a plan.</font>

89
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,270
<font color="yellow">I don't really have a plan at the moment.</font>

90
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,600
<font color="yellow">This is why I always tell you that you're immature and thoughtless.</font>

91
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,000
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're young enough to fool around like that?</font>

92
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,100
<font color="yellow">You should meet the right guy before it gets too late.</font>

93
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,570
<font color="yellow">Or just get back together Se Bang.</font>

94
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,540
<font color="yellow">Don't mention him again.</font>

95
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,440
<font color="yellow">Please leave this up to me.</font>

96
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,640
<font color="yellow">I am 40 years old.</font>

97
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,540
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be controlled by parents any more...</font>

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,970
<font color="yellow">like an elementary school kid.</font>

99
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,270
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

100
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,370
<font color="yellow">Did you hear what she said?</font>

101
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,570
<font color="yellow">She's totally head over heels for him.</font>

102
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,140
<font color="yellow">She's completely in love.</font>

103
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,570
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

104
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,040
<font color="yellow">You should get back together with Ddol Ee's dad.</font>

105
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,240
<font color="yellow">Why would you meet a man who is penniless?</font>

106
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,670
<font color="yellow">You'll be directed to voicemail.</font>

107
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,340
<font color="yellow">Please speak after the beep.</font>

108
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,340
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

109
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,340
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,970
<font color="yellow">Didn't she say anything to you?</font>

111
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,170
<font color="yellow">No, she didn't.</font>

112
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,170
<font color="yellow">We don't talk these days.</font>

113
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,770
<font color="yellow">Did she say she wants some fresh air?</font>

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,470
<font color="yellow">She just suddenly told me that she wanted to get some fresh air.</font>

115
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,000
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

116
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,970
<font color="yellow">She is not persistent at all.</font>

117
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,070
<font color="yellow">She said she'll save money for her kids.</font>

118
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,840
<font color="yellow">She even had a fight at her restaurant with some jerks.</font>

119
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,270
<font color="yellow">It's not her first time running away from home.</font>

120
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,270
<font color="yellow">I thought she was doing quite well this time.</font>

121
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

122
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,340
<font color="yellow">Don't mind her. She'll be back after a while.</font>

123
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,640
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo, are you sick?</font>

124
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,270
<font color="yellow">Lie on your stomach.</font>

125
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,400
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. Get back to sleep.</font>

126
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,000
<font color="yellow">Go on and lie on your stomach.</font>

127
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,740
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

128
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
<font color="yellow">Your rent is not overdue any more.</font>

129
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,070
<font color="yellow">Is something on your mind?</font>

130
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,400
<font color="yellow">I don't know why this house is so full of worries.</font>

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,370
<font color="yellow">Can you give me five minutes?</font>

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,640
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

133
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,670
<font color="yellow">Make it quick, please. I have a lot to deliver today.</font>

134
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,900
<font color="yellow">This is the money you have earned so far.</font>

135
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,770
<font color="yellow">I only paid the rent and saved all the rest.</font>

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,240
<font color="yellow">Get a nice studio and start living alone.</font>

137
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,570
<font color="yellow">Are you upset with me?</font>

138
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,170
<font color="yellow">It is uncomfortable to live with you.</font>

139
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,770
<font color="yellow">I have my own life, but you won't let me meet the woman who likes me.</font>

140
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,070
<font color="yellow">You're not doing this because of that. Tell me the truth.</font>

141
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,670
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live with you any more.</font>

142
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
<font color="yellow">Since you're all grown up, live your own life.</font>

143
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,700
<font color="yellow">It's not time for that yet.</font>

144
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,340
<font color="yellow">I can't afford to do that.</font>

145
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,340
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you grunt every night any more...</font>

146
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,700
<font color="yellow">just because you deliver water and liquor all the time.</font>

147
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,740
<font color="yellow">- I won't grunt. - You don't need to feed me.</font>

148
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
<font color="yellow">You even got humiliated at the police station.</font>

149
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,770
<font color="yellow">Without me, you can live a nice life by yourself.</font>

150
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,270
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

151
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,800
<font color="yellow">Even without you, I have to work to make a living.</font>

152
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,400
<font color="yellow">Listen to me. You don't have to suffer because of me.</font>

153
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,970
<font color="yellow">I'm not suffering!</font>

154
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,800
<font color="yellow">I'll come home early. Let's have dinner together.</font>

155
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,900
<font color="yellow">I'm not your dad.</font>

156
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,970
<font color="yellow">I'm not your biological father.</font>

157
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,370
<font color="yellow">I should have said this earlier, but I didn't want to hurt you.</font>

158
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,440
<font color="yellow">I was also afraid that you might leave me.</font>

159
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,600
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

160
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,900
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo. Geum Soo Jo.</font>

161
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,940
<font color="yellow">Dad. They found him.</font>

162
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,440
<font color="yellow">Did they? Where is he?</font>

163
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,200
<font color="yellow">I told them to come home. I'll be there, too.</font>

164
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,600
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

165
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,800
<font color="yellow">- I'm nervous. - Hey, don't be.</font>

166
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,770
<font color="yellow">You better pull this off well.</font>

167
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,570
<font color="yellow">What if we get caught?</font>

168
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,270
<font color="yellow">Don't talk too much. If they ask something, just say yes or no.</font>

169
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,240
<font color="yellow">- How old are you? - I'm 32.</font>

170
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,740
<font color="yellow">- When is your birthday? - December 3.</font>

171
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,200
<font color="yellow">If they ask you anything else, say that you don't remember anything.</font>

172
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,940
<font color="yellow">Just do what we always do at the police station.</font>

173
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,100
<font color="yellow">I know. I just have to remain silent.</font>

174
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,440
<font color="yellow">If you do a good job, all of their fortune will come to us.</font>

175
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,740
<font color="yellow">There she comes.</font>

176
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,740
<font color="yellow">Put on a sad face. Cue.</font>

177
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,470
<font color="yellow">Put on a sad face and keep it that way.</font>

178
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,800
<font color="yellow">Keep pretending.</font>

179
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,440
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Ms Yeo.</font>

180
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,200
<font color="yellow">This is your long-lost son.</font>

181
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

182
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,040
<font color="yellow">You were alive, my son. You were alive all along.</font>

183
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,010
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - You brats.</font>

184
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,370
<font color="yellow">You punks.</font>

185
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,300
<font color="yellow">- What is it, Dad? - They're swindlers.</font>

186
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,010
<font color="yellow">They're doing this to take our money.</font>

187
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,010
<font color="yellow">- You little punks. - Goodness.</font>

188
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,300
<font color="yellow">Wait. Wait for me.</font>

189
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,540
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

190
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,070
<font color="yellow">How could they think of doing something like this?</font>

191
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,940
<font color="yellow">Some people even try to take money from people who are dying.</font>

192
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,270
<font color="yellow">Let's report this to the police.</font>

193
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,540
<font color="yellow">It will get complicated if this goes public.</font>

194
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,940
<font color="yellow">People who are after money will gather like ants.</font>

195
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,200
<font color="yellow">I also want to use mass media to find him.</font>

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,370
<font color="yellow">But I can't because of people like them.</font>

197
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,400
<font color="yellow">I bet they'll even manipulate genetic test results.</font>

198
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,570
<font color="yellow">What should we do then? How can we find him?</font>

199
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,340
<font color="yellow">Let's not rush ourselves. Let's do this step by step.</font>

200
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,900
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we'll find him.</font>

201
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,240
<font color="yellow">I would've found him if I tried sooner.</font>

202
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,670
<font color="yellow">It's my fault.</font>

203
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,100
<font color="yellow">While I was leading a decent life,</font>

204
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,700
<font color="yellow">I bet he resented me so much.</font>

205
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,470
<font color="yellow">It was a rough day today.</font>

206
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,740
<font color="yellow">Can we meet for a moment?</font>

207
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,400
<font color="yellow">I think I'll feel better if I see you.</font>

208
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,040
<font color="yellow">- Is it Soo Jo? - No.</font>

209
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,540
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell him that?</font>

210
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,570
<font color="yellow">He's going through a lot because of me.</font>

211
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,670
<font color="yellow">What if he goes to find his biological parents?</font>

212
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,300
<font color="yellow">Then I should let him go.</font>

213
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,600
<font color="yellow">I hope his parents have enough money to feed him.</font>

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,900
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo would be miserable if they end up to be poorer than me.</font>

215
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,070
<font color="yellow">What if he suffers there, too?</font>

216
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,300
<font color="yellow">I'm 100 percent sure he will.</font>

217
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,100
<font color="yellow">They must've abandoned him because they didn't have enough money.</font>

218
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,800
<font color="yellow">He'll still live a rough life even if he does find his real parents.</font>

219
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,200
<font color="yellow">We can't do anything about his fate.</font>

220
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,370
<font color="yellow">Why did you even bother telling him that?</font>

221
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,900
<font color="yellow">You just caused your own trouble.</font>

222
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,400
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What a fool.</font>

223
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,740
<font color="yellow">I'll get going. Call me if something happens.</font>

224
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

225
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
<font color="yellow">You'll be directed to voicemail.</font>

226
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,370
<font color="yellow">Please speak after the beep.</font>

227
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,500
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo. I bet you're quite shocked, aren't you?</font>

228
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,600
<font color="yellow">Just forget what I said.</font>

229
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,000
<font color="yellow">Don't think of anything else.</font>

230
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,100
<font color="yellow">No matter what happens, you're my son.</font>

231
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,900
<font color="yellow">You are my own son even if the world ends.</font>

232
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,140
<font color="yellow">I take back what I said...</font>

233
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,840
<font color="yellow">about me not being your biological father.</font>

234
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,670
<font color="yellow">- Where should he put this? - Over here, please.</font>

235
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,640
<font color="yellow">The office looks nice.</font>

236
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,200
<font color="yellow">They're all used, but they look fine, don't they?</font>

237
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,900
<font color="yellow">- You're so frugal. - I have to be frugal to survive.</font>

238
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,140
<font color="yellow">Say hello. This is my cousin. This is my investor.</font>

239
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
<font color="yellow">Aren't I your boyfriend, as well?</font>

240
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,970
<font color="yellow">Stop joking.</font>

241
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,200
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Choi Ha Soo.</font>

242
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,440
<font color="yellow">I'm Go Dal Pa. I have a funny name.</font>

243
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,800
<font color="yellow">So do I.</font>

244
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,170
<font color="yellow">Let's go out. I'll treat you to celebrate your grand opening.</font>

245
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,570
<font color="yellow">I ordered Chinese food already.</font>

246
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,170
<font color="yellow">Delivery.</font>

247
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,070
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

248
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,440
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I'm so sorry.</font>

249
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,970
<font color="yellow">- You should've quickly avoided me. - Dal Tong.</font>

250
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,200
<font color="yellow">It was my mistake.</font>

251
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,200
<font color="yellow">- Where is Gab Dol? - Why would he be here?</font>

252
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,940
<font color="yellow">You should have come sooner.</font>

253
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,070
<font color="yellow">You should've gotten here earlier to congratulate your future wife.</font>

254
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,370
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

255
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,340
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa. It's been a long time.</font>

256
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,640
<font color="yellow">- How have you been? - Good.</font>

257
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,270
<font color="yellow">- Who's your boyfriend? - Neither of them.</font>

258
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,470
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa, let's eat. We need to go clean in the afternoon.</font>

259
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

260
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,170
<font color="yellow">I invited you, but there is nothing much to eat.</font>

261
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,400
<font color="yellow">No. I like this kind of food.</font>

262
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,700
<font color="yellow">I starved for a week after we made an appointment.</font>

263
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,070
<font color="yellow">People say it's delicious once they try it, but I'm not sure.</font>

264
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,600
<font color="yellow">- Try it. - Thank you for the meal.</font>

265
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,200
<font color="yellow">It's delicious, Mother.</font>

266
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,840
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved then. Help yourself.</font>

267
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,800
<font color="yellow">Will your parents like Gab Dol as your husband?</font>

268
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,370
<font color="yellow">Don't you think they'll oppose your marriage?</font>

269
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,170
<font color="yellow">What is there to not like about Gab Dol?</font>

270
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,570
<font color="yellow">You're so sweet to say that.</font>

271
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,170
<font color="yellow">I like you more than Gab Dol.</font>

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,370
<font color="yellow">My mum can't cook delicious food like you.</font>

273
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,600
<font color="yellow">Well, she's a teacher. I'm sure she's busy with work.</font>

274
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,500
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol doesn't know I'm here, right?</font>

275
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,740
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell him because you didn't want me to.</font>

276
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,700
<font color="yellow">- What's up? Have you eaten? - I grabbed a bite.</font>

277
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,400
<font color="yellow">Don't just grab a bite. Eat properly.</font>

278
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,000
<font color="yellow">- What's up? - I came by because I missed you.</font>

279
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,370
<font color="yellow">Liar.</font>

280
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for yesterday.</font>

281
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,240
<font color="yellow">Don't mind what my mum said.</font>

282
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,770
<font color="yellow">She's not really like that, but she uses harsh words.</font>

283
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,300
<font color="yellow">My siblings and I also get shocked and hurt often.</font>

284
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,900
<font color="yellow">I understand her.</font>

285
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,470
<font color="yellow">I have something to ask you.</font>

286
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,740
<font color="yellow">Are you seeing Ddol Ee's dad these days?</font>

287
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,340
<font color="yellow">No. We got divorced years ago.</font>

288
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,340
<font color="yellow">Then why did your mother say that?</font>

289
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,470
<font color="yellow">He came to my parents' house to see Ddol Ee.</font>

290
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,940
<font color="yellow">We didn't meet alone.</font>

291
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,040
<font color="yellow">I just saw him because he came to our house. Don't mind him.</font>

292
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,100
<font color="yellow">I guess it bothered you.</font>

293
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,500
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I feel like this.</font>

294
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,870
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep.</font>

295
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,170
<font color="yellow">I can beat every man in the world,</font>

296
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,470
<font color="yellow">but I can't do anything with your ex-husband.</font>

297
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,970
<font color="yellow">He's Ddol Ee's dad.</font>

298
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,140
<font color="yellow">He's just his biological father.</font>

299
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,940
<font color="yellow">You couldn't sleep?</font>

300
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,570
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

301
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,170
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

302
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,240
<font color="yellow">You should experience it yourself to understand me.</font>

303
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,600
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

304
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,640
<font color="yellow">When you once met your ex-wife behind my back,</font>

305
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,640
<font color="yellow">I felt the same way.</font>

306
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,100
<font color="yellow">When I think of that, I want to drag you to a remote place and...</font>

307
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,670
<font color="yellow">And what?</font>

308
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,300
<font color="yellow">I'll leave the rest to your imagination.</font>

309
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,540
<font color="yellow">She is just my kids' mum and that's all.</font>

310
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,070
<font color="yellow">He is like that, too. I don't have any feelings for him.</font>

311
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,570
<font color="yellow">He means nothing to me. I mean it.</font>

312
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

314
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,600
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

315
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,940
<font color="yellow">You haven't forgotten me, have you?</font>

316
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,400
<font color="yellow">- It's me. Cho Rong. - Hello.</font>

317
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,900
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

318
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,470
<font color="yellow">You've grown so big. You look handsome.</font>

319
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,770
<font color="yellow">I made this at school.</font>

320
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,300
<font color="yellow">I made it for you.</font>

321
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

322
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,840
<font color="yellow">I brought you candy. Take some.</font>

323
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,300
<font color="yellow">"Ddol Ee, I'm sorry for everything."</font>

324
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,470
<font color="yellow">"I regret I wasn't friendly with you when we lived together."</font>

325
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,870
<font color="yellow">"Let's be good friends from now on."</font>

326
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,210
<font color="yellow">"Ddol Ee, see you again. Goodbye."</font>

327
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,870
<font color="yellow">What is this nonsense?</font>

328
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,100
<font color="yellow">I can't believe he made his children do this.</font>

329
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,940
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem like they were made to do it.</font>

330
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,140
<font color="yellow">It looks like she made it at school.</font>

331
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,000
<font color="yellow">Perhaps she was reminded of Ddol Ee.</font>

332
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,670
<font color="yellow">It's not something kids can think of doing.</font>

333
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,270
<font color="yellow">How could a person be so cunning like that?</font>

334
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,570
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee can hear you.</font>

335
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,900
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

336
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,640
<font color="yellow">Even if you hear it and you know, pretend like you don't know.</font>

337
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,040
<font color="yellow">We don't have ears.</font>

338
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,440
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

339
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

340
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,440
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

341
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,210
<font color="yellow">We've been through the Korean War.</font>

342
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,100
<font color="yellow">We've been through everything.</font>

343
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,370
<font color="yellow">Let's go to our rooms. Let's go.</font>

344
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

345
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,440
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

346
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,600
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say.</font>

347
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,940
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik wouldn't do anything like that. Don't you know him?</font>

348
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,670
<font color="yellow">If you're urgent, you can do anything.</font>

349
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,500
<font color="yellow">Since it's difficult to live alone with two children,</font>

350
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,470
<font color="yellow">he's trying to get Jae Soon back to take advantage of her.</font>

351
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,210
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since they got divorced. He's not our son-in-law.</font>

352
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you so against Ddol Ee's father?</font>

353
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,740
<font color="yellow">He's Ddol Ee's father.</font>

354
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,800
<font color="yellow">Plus he's in love with her.</font>

355
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,300
<font color="yellow">I won't allow him.</font>

356
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,970
<font color="yellow">Don't bring him up any more.</font>

357
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,140
<font color="yellow">Grandfather, do you feel all right?</font>

358
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,070
<font color="yellow">Not really.</font>

359
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,840
<font color="yellow">You don't look happy.</font>

360
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,870
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go shopping with me?</font>

361
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,540
<font color="yellow">I can't be bothered to do anything.</font>

362
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,940
<font color="yellow">About Se Gye...</font>

363
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,770
<font color="yellow">I hope you appoint him as the director of the headquarters soon.</font>

364
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,640
<font color="yellow">It's not pleasant to see him do petty chores.</font>

365
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,710
<font color="yellow">Mum keeps bossing him around.</font>

366
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,440
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if he works as the director of the headquarters.</font>

367
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,570
<font color="yellow">I'm considering that.</font>

368
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,500
<font color="yellow">I will make it happen soon.</font>

369
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,840
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

370
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,900
<font color="yellow">It's the sample for the new product.</font>

371
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,140
<font color="yellow">Hang it up over there.</font>

372
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother.</font>

373
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,400
<font color="yellow">Call me Director at work.</font>

374
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,140
<font color="yellow">Okay, Director.</font>

375
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,800
<font color="yellow">I really don't understand you.</font>

376
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,370
<font color="yellow">You should have stayed as a doctor that everyone looks up to.</font>

377
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,240
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to do this?</font>

378
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,340
<font color="yellow">You must have other reasons.</font>

379
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:14,016
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I'm making kalguksu.</font>

380
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,210
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

381
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,000
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - Joong Nyeon.</font>

382
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,170
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

383
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
<font color="yellow">You're at it again.</font>

384
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,840
<font color="yellow">- It's because of you. - Oh, my.</font>

385
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,000
<font color="yellow">Go in. You'll be stressed when you see me cook.</font>

386
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,440
<font color="yellow">Do you at least know?</font>

387
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,840
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be stressed. He'll clean it up.</font>

388
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,840
<font color="yellow">- Bring a rag. - Okay.</font>

389
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,670
<font color="yellow">You should just eat the food I made.</font>

390
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,970
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you want to cook.</font>

391
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,470
<font color="yellow">Isn't it tiresome?</font>

392
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,600
<font color="yellow">I'm into housekeeping these days.</font>

393
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,370
<font color="yellow">A hobby late in life is more dear.</font>

394
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,710
<font color="yellow">Go get the door.</font>

395
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

396
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,400
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

397
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,840
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mother.</font>

398
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,670
<font color="yellow">Are you hear alone? What about Se Gye?</font>

399
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,100
<font color="yellow">He's at work right now. I'm here by myself.</font>

400
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,540
<font color="yellow">You come and go by yourself now.</font>

401
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,000
<font color="yellow">You didn't bring any presents?</font>

402
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,540
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - How could you...</font>

403
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,900
<font color="yellow">come here without any presents?</font>

404
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,270
<font color="yellow">You should at least bring some candy.</font>

405
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,770
<font color="yellow">What did your mother teach you?</font>

406
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,270
<font color="yellow">You're not like me.</font>

407
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,740
<font color="yellow">Should I go buy some candy?</font>

408
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,440
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

409
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
<font color="yellow">I'm here to order you some food.</font>

410
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,770
<font color="yellow">- Order food? - Yes.</font>

411
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,170
<font color="yellow">I'm not a great cook, so I'll order some food and get brownie points.</font>

412
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,970
<font color="yellow">- Where's Father? - In the kitchen.</font>

413
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,200
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon, your daughter-in-law wants to order you food.</font>

414
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,570
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

415
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,540
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

416
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,240
<font color="yellow">Do you clean the house yourself?</font>

417
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,040
<font color="yellow">I sometimes do it to workout.</font>

418
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,070
<font color="yellow">Father. Would you like jokbal, pizza or sweet and sour pork?</font>

419
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,700
<font color="yellow">You can order anything you want.</font>

420
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,540
<font color="yellow">There's no need for that. We can fix a meal at home.</font>

421
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,540
<font color="yellow">Your rich daughter-in-law wants to buy you food. Don't turn it down.</font>

422
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,970
<font color="yellow">When will you get served food like this?</font>

423
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,070
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

424
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat?</font>

425
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,600
<font color="yellow">I'll buy it. Order anything you want.</font>

426
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,200
<font color="yellow">No, I really want to buy it for you.</font>

427
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,300
<font color="yellow">Let's let her treat us.</font>

428
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,170
<font color="yellow">If you can't cook, you should at least do this.</font>

429
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,370
<font color="yellow">She wants to please us.</font>

430
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

431
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,340
<font color="yellow">We were about to starve since somebody spilled the flour.</font>

432
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
<font color="yellow">Let's order.</font>

433
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,870
<font color="yellow">What would you like to eat?</font>

434
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,940
<font color="yellow">Let's order sashimi.</font>

435
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,800
<font color="yellow">Your father-in-law will do anything for sashimi.</font>

436
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,840
<font color="yellow">Then I'll start off with sashimi that Father will do anything for.</font>

437
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,140
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't repeat what she says word by word.</font>

438
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,700
<font color="yellow">Mother, what would you do anything for?</font>

439
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,800
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon.</font>

440
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,300
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

441
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,240
<font color="yellow">I came to see Chief.</font>

442
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,840
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to come here again.</font>

443
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,170
<font color="yellow">It's great that you came.</font>

444
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,140
<font color="yellow">How does the hospital air feel like?</font>

445
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,100
<font color="yellow">It's like perfume. It's wonderful.</font>

446
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,640
<font color="yellow">What did Chief say?</font>

447
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,770
<font color="yellow">He told me that I'm always welcome to come back.</font>

448
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,940
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

449
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,670
<font color="yellow">You know what I'm good at.</font>

450
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
<font color="yellow">Smiling?</font>

451
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,370
<font color="yellow">I fell in love with you because of that and look at me now.</font>

452
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,870
<font color="yellow">You have a way of making jokes...</font>

453
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,870

00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you didn't call me out to talk about work.</font>

605
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,900
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'll get straight to the point.</font>

606
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,670
<font color="yellow">Can't you let Gab Dol go?</font>

607
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,610
<font color="yellow">Did he say that I didn't let him go?</font>

608
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,340
<font color="yellow">Please be understanding if I offended you.</font>

609
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,170
<font color="yellow">I know that you were his girlfriend.</font>

610
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,840
<font color="yellow">I also know that Gab Dol's family was against your relationship.</font>

611
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,170
<font color="yellow">To be frank, I liked Gab Dol from the first time I saw him.</font>

612
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,270
<font color="yellow">Marriage works out best when they're of similar living standards.</font>

613
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,170
<font color="yellow">His mother seems to be worried.</font>

614
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,300
<font color="yellow">You met his mother?</font>

615
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,240
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've even been to his house many times.</font>

616
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,870
<font color="yellow">I guess he didn't mention that.</font>

617
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,570
<font color="yellow">I love his mother's food. She gets along well with me.</font>

618
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,370
<font color="yellow">It seems that Gab Dol can't make up his mind...</font>

619
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,740
<font color="yellow">because he is trying to be considerate.</font>

620
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,340
<font color="yellow">Let's make it a win-win for us all.</font>

621
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,540
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, say it quickly and leave.</font>

622
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,970
<font color="yellow">The inspection is mandatory.</font>

623
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,170
<font color="yellow">Don't wedge me in between your love.</font>

624
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,370
<font color="yellow">Is your love more ardent because you have an ex-girlfriend...</font>

625
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,340
<font color="yellow">that you've dated for 10 years in the backdrop?</font>

626
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,840
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

627
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,370
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have made you and Mum meet each other like that.</font>

628
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,140
<font color="yellow">It was because I was desperate.</font>

629
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,240
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm sure you wanted me to get scolded.</font>

630
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,700
<font color="yellow">Don't be sarcastic.</font>

631
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,470
<font color="yellow">Please be cooperative. You know my feelings.</font>

632
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,170
<font color="yellow">I thought I did.</font>

633
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,240
<font color="yellow">I don't any more.</font>

634
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,770
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

635
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,300
<font color="yellow">How did we seem that she would say such a thing?</font>

636
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,540
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? What did Young Ran say?</font>

637
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,440
<font color="yellow">- You know well. - I don't.</font>

638
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,500
<font color="yellow">Tell me. What did she say?</font>

639
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,970
<font color="yellow">She told me to let you go.</font>

640
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,070
<font color="yellow">And I will.</font>

641
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,770
<font color="yellow">I'll meet a guy that suits me as a cleaner.</font>

642
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,670
<font color="yellow">You go meet a public official that fits you.</font>

643
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,610
<font color="yellow">I heard that's the way it should be.</font>

644
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,800
<font color="yellow">I heard she even went to your house.</font>

645
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,170
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

646
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,170
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me she talked with your mother about marriage?</font>

647
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,000
<font color="yellow">How much more do you need to hurt me to end it?</font>

648
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,200
<font color="yellow">When I was being inspected in front of you two,</font>

649
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,300
<font color="yellow">I kept telling myself that this is just for business.</font>

650
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,270
<font color="yellow">But I felt like I was naked.</font>

651
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be humiliated any more.</font>

652
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,400
<font color="yellow">Did you like watching me like that together?</font>

653
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,610
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you have called me earlier?</font>

654
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,000
<font color="yellow">- You didn't pick up. - You could have sent me a text.</font>

655
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,670
<font color="yellow">Was it funny?</font>

656
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,400
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get the voice mail?</font>

657
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

658
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,110
<font color="yellow">Listen to it first before you say that.</font>

659
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,740
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, your cleaning company will be under inspection today.</font>

660
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,640
<font color="yellow">I know you're ready. But, check once again just to be sure.</font>

661
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,840
<font color="yellow">Two Hoovers...</font>

662
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,540
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that she even came to my house.</font>

663
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

664
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
<font color="yellow">What are we here for?</font>

665
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,110
<font color="yellow">Ms Kim. What did you say to Gab Soon?</font>

666
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,610
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon isn't someone you can walk all over.</font>

667
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,800
<font color="yellow">Don't look down on her just because she's a cleaner.</font>

668
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,700
<font color="yellow">What gives you the right to treat her this way?</font>

669
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,640
<font color="yellow">I never thought you'd do this. I'm disappointed in you.</font>

670
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,000
<font color="yellow">"Date someone on your own level"?</font>

671
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,970
<font color="yellow">What level?</font>

672
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,110
<font color="yellow">I'm not on your level.</font>

673
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,540
<font color="yellow">Please find someone else who is.</font>

674
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,270
<font color="yellow">Apologise to Gab Soon.</font>

675
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,440
<font color="yellow">I guess I overstepped the line.</font>

676
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. That was thoughtless of me.</font>

677
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,270
<font color="yellow">Please stop coming to my house.</font>

678
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,300
<font color="yellow">I apologise for my mother's mistake on behalf of her.</font>

679
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,970
<font color="yellow">I decide whom I'm going to marry,</font>

680
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,700
<font color="yellow">not my mother.</font>

681
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,700
<font color="yellow">Your feelings must've been hurt.</font>

682
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,440
<font color="yellow">You have a strong pride, and I made you hear things like that.</font>

683
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,640
<font color="yellow">I want to quit my job if I could.</font>

684
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,540
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

685
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,000
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to marry me?</font>

686
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,770
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

687
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,640
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to do this?</font>

688
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,740
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you will stay with me until the end?</font>

689
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,540
<font color="yellow">Follow me, then.</font>

690
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,470
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you two?</font>

691
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,670
<font color="yellow">Mum, Dad. We want to get married.</font>

692
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,610
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

693
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,270
<font color="yellow">We already said no.</font>

694
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,770
<font color="yellow">Look at these brats. Get out right now.</font>

695
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,110
<font color="yellow">Please let us.</font>

696
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,570
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if you disapprove. We'll do it anyway.</font>

697
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,540
<font color="yellow">You know how stubborn she can be.</font>

698
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,500
<font color="yellow">We'll live a happy life.</font>

699
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,540
<font color="yellow">We've been together for 10 years.</font>

700
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,800
<font color="yellow">Please help us, so those years can finally pay off.</font>

701
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,400
<font color="yellow">We'll be good to you.</font>

702
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,840
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

703
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,500
<font color="yellow">If you want to be good to us, break up. I don't need to hear more.</font>

704
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,540
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

705
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,770
<font color="yellow">I told you many times. Let's say we're fine with it.</font>

706
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,340
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol. Do you think your mother will approve?</font>

707
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,470
<font color="yellow">Even if she doesn't, we'll do it. It doesn't matter.</font>

708
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,610
<font color="yellow">Did I raise you to be so reckless?</font>

709
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,970
<font color="yellow">How can you get married without your parents' permission?</font>

710
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,540
<font color="yellow">- You little... - Please don't hit her.</font>

711
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,900
<font color="yellow">Have pity on your dad.</font>

712
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,900
<font color="yellow">He devoted his whole life to you.</font>

713
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,110
<font color="yellow">He begged others for milk in the cold winter to raise you.</font>

714
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,070
<font color="yellow">He didn't even get married because of you.</font>

715
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,900
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

716
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,270
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo. My dear Soo Jo.</font>

717
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,800
<font color="yellow">- My son. - Stop it.</font>

718
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,740
<font color="yellow">Don't hug me. I'm not a child.</font>

719
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,870
<font color="yellow">I bought some meat. It's rib eye, your favourite.</font>

720
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,970
<font color="yellow">I haven't eaten all day. I'm starving.</font>

721
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,610
<font color="yellow">You haven't eaten either, right?</font>

722
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,000
<font color="yellow">Take care of the vegetables.</font>

723
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,870
<font color="yellow">I'll cook the meat.</font>

724
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,500
<font color="yellow">You must've been very surprised.</font>

725
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,170
<font color="yellow">I'm not a kid in adolescence.</font>

726
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,170
<font color="yellow">I'm 32 years old.</font>

727
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,440
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if you're not my biological father at this age.</font>

728
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,200
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved you're not my brother.</font>

729
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,970
<font color="yellow">If you were my brother, it'd be terrible.</font>

730
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,110
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

731
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,440
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything.</font>

732
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,240
<font color="yellow">You've always been my dad, and that's not going to change.</font>

733
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,540
<font color="yellow">Do you suddenly find me bothersome?</font>

734
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I'm going to cling on to you and never let go.</font>

735
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,700
<font color="yellow">I can't abandon my dad who begged others for milk to raise me.</font>

736
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,240
<font color="yellow">You couldn't get married because of me.</font>

737
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,400
<font color="yellow">You might die without a spouse.</font>

738
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,140
<font color="yellow">I can't abandon my poor dad.</font>

739
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,140
<font color="yellow">No matter what others say, you're my dad.</font>

740
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,140
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one thing.</font>

741
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,740
<font color="yellow">How did we meet?</font>

742
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,640
<font color="yellow">We met at the riverside.</font>

743
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,610
<font color="yellow">How romantic.</font>

744
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,270
<font color="yellow">Did you and I meet for the first time at the riverside?</font>

745
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

746
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,300
<font color="yellow">I still remember that day distinctly.</font>

747
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,340
<font color="yellow">I was also an orphan who had no parents or siblings.</font>

748
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,170
<font color="yellow">Ever since I was little,</font>

749
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,940
<font color="yellow">I barely managed to survive...</font>

750
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,400
<font color="yellow">by living off Sam Sik's family.</font>

751
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,640
<font color="yellow">Nothing was working out, and I had no one to rely on.</font>

752
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,900
<font color="yellow">I thought I shouldn't live any more,</font>

753
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,070
<font color="yellow">so I went to that riverside to kill myself.</font>

754
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,670
<font color="yellow">It was a very cold day.</font>

755
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,000
<font color="yellow">There was a snowstorm.</font>

756
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,970
<font color="yellow">I was about to throw myself...</font>

757
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,200
<font color="yellow">in the river with my eyes closed.</font>

758
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,970
<font color="yellow">That's when I heard a baby crying.</font>

759
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,940
<font color="yellow">I didn't know why, but I ran toward it like crazy.</font>

760
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,840
<font color="yellow">Then I found you, a beautiful baby boy,</font>

761
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,800
<font color="yellow">wrapped in a baby blanket on the riverbank.</font>

762
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,870
<font color="yellow">The moment I saw you, I held you in my arms and ran without thinking.</font>

763
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,640
<font color="yellow">I wanted to save you.</font>

764
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,300
<font color="yellow">I thought I shouldn't let anything happen to you,</font>

765
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,140
<font color="yellow">so I ran like crazy.</font>

766
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,240
<font color="yellow">I never ran even if someone paid me.</font>

767
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,340
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

768
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,340
<font color="yellow">After that,</font>

769
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,940
<font color="yellow">you and I became inseparable.</font>

770
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,170
<font color="yellow">After you came to my life,</font>

771
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,270
<font color="yellow">I strangely stopped thinking about dying.</font>

772
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,270
<font color="yellow">You're the saviour of my life.</font>

773
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,140
<font color="yellow">You're like a treasure I found.</font>

774
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,470
<font color="yellow">I'm a burden, not a treasure.</font>

775
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,540
<font color="yellow">You couldn't get married because of me.</font>

776
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,900
<font color="yellow">I had no woman to marry anyway.</font>

777
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:15,070
<font color="yellow">What about the lady at the restaurant who used to give us food?</font>

778
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,570
<font color="yellow">I flirted with her only to get food from her.</font>

779
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,400
<font color="yellow">I still remember it.</font>

780
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,100
<font color="yellow">She said she'd marry you if you sent me to an orphanage.</font>

781
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,400
<font color="yellow">You said you could never abandon me.</font>

782
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,840
<font color="yellow">Do you remember that?</font>

783
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,400
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

784
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,440
<font color="yellow">I was so scared that you might run away with her.</font>

785
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,740
<font color="yellow">She's not my type.</font>

786
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,640
<font color="yellow">I dated her only because of the food.</font>

787
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,840

788
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,770

792
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,970
<font color="yellow">If they're rich, let's sponge off them.</font>

793
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,840
<font color="yellow">We'll be able to find them with these sneakers.</font>

794
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,170
<font color="yellow">I think they belong to your mum.</font>

795
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,800
<font color="yellow">Even if they live right next to us, I won't meet them.</font>

796
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,140
<font color="yellow">Even if they're rich, I don't care.</font>

797
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,800
<font color="yellow">I only need you.</font>

798
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,800
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that, my son.</font>

799
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,640
<font color="yellow">Don't ever tell me to leave.</font>

800
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,970
<font color="yellow">I don't have anywhere else to go. You shouldn't kick me out.</font>

801
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,700
<font color="yellow">Is it delicious?</font>

802
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,840
<font color="yellow">Shall we open the door and make the people in the main building jealous?</font>

803
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,400
<font color="yellow">Let's shout out we're having rib eye.</font>

807
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,270
<font color="yellow">When I had only two meals a day,</font>

808
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,470

812
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,640
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa always liked eggs ever since he was little.</font>

813
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,340
<font color="yellow">He can finish 10 eggs in one sitting.</font>

814
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,800

816
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,300
<font color="yellow">Yes. When Gab Soon comes back, I'll give her some, as well.</font>

<font color="yellow">What's taking Dad so long?</font>

930
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:22,970

931
