00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,945
<font color="yellow">and hungry.</font>

157
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,245
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem.</font>

158
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:48,590
<font color="yellow">5,000 for deposit and 200 for rent?</font>

159
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,090
<font color="yellow">You should consider yourself lucky.</font>

160
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,587
<font color="yellow">We don't get places like this now.</font>

161
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,305
<font color="yellow">They all want to get more rent.</font>

162
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:55,390
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

163
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,945
<font color="yellow">I think you'd better...</font>

164
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,945
<font color="yellow">let them get married.</font>

165
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:02,445
<font color="yellow">- Don't they have parents?
-  They do...</font>

166
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:06,060
<font color="yellow">but my sister got pregnant unexpectedly.</font>

167
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,694
<font color="yellow">That's why they should register their marriage!</font>

168
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:11,805
<font color="yellow">They will. We're going to tell our parents after they settle down.</font>

169
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:17,247
<font color="yellow">Sir, please put the place on hold for a few days.</font>

170
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:19,040
<font color="yellow">I'll bring the money.</font>

171
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,684
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me!
-  No, it's mine!</font>

172
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,105
<font color="yellow">Give it to me!</font>

173
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:24,905
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

174
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,145
<font color="yellow">What is it? Can't you keep quiet?</font>

175
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,005
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so loud?</font>

176
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,945
<font color="yellow">I told you not to fight.</font>

177
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,605
<font color="yellow">Go on your knees and put your hands up.</font>

178
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:37,475
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
-  I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

179
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:40,275
<font color="yellow">I was playing with it...</font>

180
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,745
<font color="yellow">and he took it from me.</font>

181
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:46,805
<font color="yellow">- It's mine.
-  It's not yours!</font>

182
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:49,875
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

183
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:52,545
<font color="yellow">He wasn't behaving properly so I disciplined him.</font>

184
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:55,487
<font color="yellow">He plays with the toys by himself...</font>

185
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:57,045
<font color="yellow">and always takes Da Rong's.</font>

186
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:59,277
<font color="yellow">You should discipline him.</font>

187
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:02,905
<font color="yellow">You bought the toys with my dad's money so aren't they Da Rong's?</font>

188
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,605
<font color="yellow">Don't fight with her. Be friends.</font>

189
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:21,570
<font color="yellow">If Da Rong plays with your toys, play with something else.</font>

190
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,745
<font color="yellow">- Okay?
-  But it's mine.</font>

191
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,760
<font color="yellow">What do you want to discuss?</font>

192
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,145
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting so I have to return soon.</font>

193
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:45,275
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry...</font>

194
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:48,275
<font color="yellow">but can you lend me some money?</font>

195
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:50,505
<font color="yellow">Money? How much do you need?</font>

196
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:51,975
<font color="yellow">I need 5,000 dollars.</font>

197
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:53,845
<font color="yellow">It's too much, right?</font>

198
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:55,694
<font color="yellow">Use the credit card.</font>

199
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,845
<font color="yellow">I need cash, not credit card.</font>

200
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:04,345
<font color="yellow">- What is it for?
-  I'll tell you later.</font>

201
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,445
<font color="yellow">Please don't ask and can you...</font>

202
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,445
<font color="yellow">It's not for anything bad.</font>

203
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,847
<font color="yellow">I don't want any secrets between us.</font>

204
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,245
<font color="yellow">Especially when it comes to finance.</font>

205
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:17,605
<font color="yellow">People think businesses run themselves...</font>

206
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,945
<font color="yellow">but it's all run on debt.</font>

207
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:23,475
<font color="yellow">As soon as there's profit, you have to invest and pay off the debt.</font>

208
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,045
<font color="yellow">Is this what you wanted to see me for?</font>

209
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,575
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I know you're busy.</font>

210
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:48,690
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

211
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,705
<font color="yellow">Throw it away. Please throw it away.</font>

212
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:52,475
<font color="yellow">Why? It's perfectly fine.</font>

213
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,405
<font color="yellow">It's time to throw it away!</font>

214
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:01,005
<font color="yellow">- It doesn't have needles.
-  Stop it.</font>

215
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,650
<font color="yellow">I got this as a commemoration of my company's founding.</font>

216
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,805
<font color="yellow">I can fix it.</font>

217
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,945
<font color="yellow">It'll cost more to fix it.</font>

218
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,505
<font color="yellow">Why are you still attached to the company that fired you?</font>

219
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:16,775
<font color="yellow">Did you get fired, Joong Nyeon?</font>

220
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:19,175
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

221
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:21,745
<font color="yellow">You couldn't stay so you got fired.</font>

222
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,545
<font color="yellow">You have a great self-esteem.</font>

223
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:27,660
<font color="yellow">Everybody else was trying to hang on...</font>

224
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,370
<font color="yellow">and you hand in the resignation letter and quit.</font>

225
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,305
<font color="yellow">It would have been great if you stayed for two more years.</font>

226
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:34,945
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about what's in the past.</font>

227
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,405
<font color="yellow">And you should not throw stuff like this. It's a bad habit.</font>

228
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:45,005
<font color="yellow">Throw it away! The entire house is turning into a dumpster.</font>

229
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:48,245
<font color="yellow">I want to throw away all that junk.</font>

230
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,345
<font color="yellow">That sounds like you're going to throw away your husband, too.</font>

231
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:53,345
<font color="yellow">Do you think he's the only one I want to throw away?</font>

232
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,033
<font color="yellow">Fine. Throw away me and Mal Nyeon.</font>

233
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,905
<font color="yellow">Live happily on your own.</font>

234
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,345
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mum.</font>

235
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:17,775
<font color="yellow">Come for some kimchi. Dad's not home.</font>

236
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,415
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

237
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:21,445
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

238
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:25,345
<font color="yellow">Don't do that. You'll get punished.</font>

239
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:28,245
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
-  I bumped into you at the sauna...</font>

240
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:31,475
<font color="yellow">and you decide to play dumb?</font>

241
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:36,130
<font color="yellow">You were like that since you were young.</font>

242
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,245
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking. Quit it.</font>

243
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:40,945
<font color="yellow">It smells so good.</font>

244
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:43,915
<font color="yellow">You saw me that day.</font>

245
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:48,491
<font color="yellow">I didn't see you, Aunt. I don't even go to saunas.</font>

246
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:52,915
<font color="yellow">The sky and earth know that you, I and Gab Soon saw each other.</font>

247
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,745
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gab Soon is in Seoul, right?</font>

248
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:59,447
<font color="yellow">No, she isn't. Why would she be in Seoul?</font>

249
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:00,845
<font color="yellow">Sit down and eat.</font>

250
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:02,575
<font color="yellow">Eat, Mal Nyeon.</font>

251
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:05,075
<font color="yellow">You must be tired after accusing her.</font>

252
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,675
<font color="yellow">Just watch, Nae Shim.</font>

253
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,975
<font color="yellow">If you don't listen to me, you'll regret it. It's hot.</font>

254
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:18,074
<font color="yellow">It's tasty. My kimchi jeon never tastes like this.</font>

255
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:19,175
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

256
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,350
<font color="yellow">why does your face look so tired?</font>

257
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,163
<font color="yellow">I thought your husband treats you well.</font>

258
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:26,554
<font color="yellow">There she goes again.</font>

259
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:30,060
<font color="yellow">You were so bright a few days ago,</font>

260
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,575
<font color="yellow">but you look so exhausted today.</font>

261
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,875
<font color="yellow">Is your husband Mr Kim or Mr Park?</font>

262
00:18:37,305 --> 00:18:40,375
<font color="yellow">- It's Mr Jo.
-  Why does Mr Jo...</font>

263
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:43,175
<font color="yellow">never call his in-laws...</font>

264
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,945
<font color="yellow">or invite us for a meal?</font>

265
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:47,605
<font color="yellow">I thought he earns a lot of money.</font>

266
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:50,145
<font color="yellow">He did serve us dinner. You weren't there.</font>

267
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,605
<font color="yellow">Her ex-husband would call you every day and say,</font>

268
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:57,320
<font color="yellow">"Mother, would you like meat or seafood?"</font>

269
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,860
<font color="yellow">If you say you want meat, he says,</font>

270
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,415
<font color="yellow">"Would you like chewy beef rib..."</font>

271
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:04,175
<font color="yellow">"or rib eye that melts at the tip of your tongue?"</font>

272
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:07,275
<font color="yellow">He never bought us pork.</font>

273
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,250
<font color="yellow">So what did he end up doing?</font>

274
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,690
<font color="yellow">He was all talk.</font>

275
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,245
<font color="yellow">No, he wasn't. Look.</font>

276
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:16,747
<font color="yellow">He paid for Gab Soon's university admission fee...</font>

277
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,313
<font color="yellow">and he paid for Se Gye's tuition several times.</font>

278
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:22,875
<font color="yellow">That wasn't all. When was that?</font>

279
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,975
<font color="yellow">Was it during fall?</font>

280
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:28,787
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. Why are you talking about what's in the past?</font>

281
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:32,305
<font color="yellow">He got Joong Nyeon's coat, your mink coat...</font>

282
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:36,605
<font color="yellow">He was awesome.</font>

283
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:38,345
<font color="yellow">He was so spontaneous.</font>

284
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,610
<font color="yellow">I told you to cut it out!</font>

285
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,775
<font color="yellow">Oh gosh.</font>

286
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:45,060
<font color="yellow">Be gentle with it.</font>

287
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,005
<font color="yellow">You'll turn it into a rag.</font>

288
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:50,860
<font color="yellow">He was such a generous man.</font>

289
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,063
<font color="yellow">He had so much cash on him.</font>

290
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:56,010
<font color="yellow">He would give out cheques like that.</font>

291
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,491
<font color="yellow">It wasn't any cheque.</font>

292
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:02,175
<font color="yellow">He would dish out cheques that were worth so much.</font>

293
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,033
<font color="yellow">He would pay for things just like that.</font>

294
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:09,575
<font color="yellow">That's what made him go broke.</font>

295
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,174
<font color="yellow">Thanks to him, Jae Soon went through so much.</font>

296
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:15,545
<font color="yellow">She was drowning in his debt even after their divorce.</font>

297
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,563
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid of seeing him in my dream.</font>

298
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,275
<font color="yellow">I hope I dream about him. He might give me some money.</font>

299
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,896
<font color="yellow">His family would insult her for preparing no wedding gift...</font>

300
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,575
<font color="yellow">and his parents would tell her to call daily and take care of them.</font>

301
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,245
<font color="yellow">They picked on her whenever they can.</font>

302
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:32,694
<font color="yellow">Just thinking about their family gives me goose bumps.</font>

303
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:34,645
<font color="yellow">That's why you made them get divorced.</font>

304
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:37,845
<font color="yellow">I didn't make them divorce. They saw it coming.</font>

305
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:42,445
<font color="yellow">Compared to him, Geum Sik is a gentleman.</font>

306
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,957
<font color="yellow">He gives her more than enough money and she gets to use his credit card.</font>

307
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,491
<font color="yellow">He considers Ddol Ee as his own son.</font>

308
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:52,653
<font color="yellow">And their house is magnificent.</font>

309
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:53,875
<font color="yellow">Have you gone over?</font>

310
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,375
<font color="yellow">- I have.
-  You haven't.</font>

311
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,975
<font color="yellow">It's already been a year.</font>

312
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,975
<font color="yellow">I don't believe any of it.</font>

313
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:05,745
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

314
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:09,294
<font color="yellow">Ignore her. She's like that.</font>

315
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:11,945
<font color="yellow">Why does she never change?</font>

316
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:14,305
<font color="yellow">I have to deal with her until I turn 100.</font>

317
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:15,605
<font color="yellow">Are you planning to be around until you're 100?</font>

318
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:21,705
<font color="yellow">I just realised you've never been to my place.</font>

319
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,581
<font color="yellow">I'm just around the corner.</font>

320
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:27,145
<font color="yellow">I wanted to drop by once in a while, but I was careful.</font>

321
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:29,945
<font color="yellow">Your sister-in-law comes by often...</font>

322
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:32,399
<font color="yellow">and he has his own kids so I didn't feel comfortable.</font>

323
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,730
<font color="yellow">Once Geum Sik is less busy, I'll invite you over to my house.</font>

324
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,060
<font color="yellow">Dad can come as well.</font>

325
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,287
<font color="yellow">Take Dad out of this.</font>

326
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:40,705
<font color="yellow">I don't like going out with him.</font>

327
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:44,745
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon is like glue. She'll stick around.</font>

328
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:47,945
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake.</font>

329
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:51,975
<font color="yellow">Don't spend too much money.</font>

330
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,740
<font color="yellow">I don't make money easily just because I run a business.</font>

331
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,745
<font color="yellow">Your ex-husband used to spend money. He was a thoughtful son-in-law.</font>

332
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,345
<font color="yellow">I don't feel comfortable going to your house.</font>

333
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:04,975
<font color="yellow">There's your sister-in-law and he has kids of his own.</font>

334
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:10,594
<font color="yellow">Yes, A Young.</font>

335
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:12,345
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go pick up my red heels?</font>

336
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:14,145
<font color="yellow">I'll pick it up now!</font>

337
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:22,475
<font color="yellow">I told you to pick it up earlier.</font>

338
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,605
<font color="yellow">You stay at home and you can't even do this?</font>

339
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:40,575
<font color="yellow">It's because of the kids.</font>

340
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,175
<font color="yellow">Please give it a few months.</font>

341
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,275
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

342
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:56,597
<font color="yellow">Oh dear. I'm sorry.</font>

343
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:57,820
<font color="yellow">- Put me upright.
-  Oh dear.</font>

344
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,845
<font color="yellow">Put me upright.</font>

345
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:09,005
<font color="yellow">Did you win a lottery?</font>

346
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:12,875
<font color="yellow">I'd be dancing then, not sitting down laughing.</font>

347
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:16,350
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? It's not time for you to go out, yet.</font>

348
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,790
<font color="yellow">I'm going to roam...</font>

349
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,245
<font color="yellow">and look for a sugar daddy who can pay off my debt and give me money.</font>

350
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:23,005
<font color="yellow">You need to take some medication.</font>

351
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,345
<font color="yellow">How can you see such a cheap woman?</font>

352
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:31,575
<font color="yellow">She's absolutely unacceptable.</font>

353
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,575
<font color="yellow">She's the only one who didn't try to flatter me.</font>

354
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:37,090
<font color="yellow">I can feel she's the one.</font>

355
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,645
<font color="yellow">That's not how you choose a girl.</font>

356
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:40,660
<font color="yellow">You only need to see one thing.</font>

357
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,090
<font color="yellow">Her family background is the most important thing.</font>

358
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,505
<font color="yellow">Don't date any girls.</font>

359
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,445
<font color="yellow">Don't give out your card to anyone.</font>

360
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:49,245
<font color="yellow">- I don't.
-  If you choose a wrong girl...</font>

361
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:53,445
<font color="yellow">What was it again?</font>

362
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:57,075
<font color="yellow">"It can ruin our family at once."</font>

363
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:58,845
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

364
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,075
<font color="yellow">If you choose a wrong girl, it can ruin our family at once.</font>

365
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:04,445
<font color="yellow">I forgot it all.</font>

366
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:06,505
<font color="yellow">It only sounds good when you say it in a mansion.</font>

367
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,975
<font color="yellow">Why would you mention it while we're having ramyeon?</font>

368
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:11,113
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

369
00:24:11,113 --> 00:24:12,375
<font color="yellow">Let me eat.</font>

370
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:23,845
<font color="yellow">Don't look at me!</font>

371
00:24:30,945 --> 00:24:32,805
<font color="yellow">You lied, right?</font>

372
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:37,145
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Your mum's not your real mum.</font>

373
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:39,705
<font color="yellow">Who told you?</font>

374
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:40,845
<font color="yellow">It was on the group chat.</font>

375
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,245
<font color="yellow">Things like that spread fast.</font>

376
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:46,245
<font color="yellow">Your biological mum ran away, right?</font>

377
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,105
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for you.</font>

378
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:55,905
<font color="yellow">- Stop it!
-  Stop!</font>

379
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:13,005
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

380
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,845
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

381
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,275
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong. Aren't you happy to see me?</font>

382
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:23,405
<font color="yellow">I came by to see you.</font>

383
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,675
<font color="yellow">You've grown a lot. You're prettier.</font>

384
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:29,745
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

385
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,710
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

386
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,143
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come!</font>

387
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,870
<font color="yellow">Why would you come? I don't need a mum!</font>

388
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,600
<font color="yellow">Don't get angry. You're scaring me.</font>

389
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,770
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

390
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,470
<font color="yellow">I don't need it!</font>

391
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

392
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

393
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,770
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to see you. I don't know why I'm crying.</font>

394
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,270
<font color="yellow">What are you crying for?</font>

395
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,440
<font color="yellow">It's for nothing.</font>

396
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
<font color="yellow">I'm just...</font>

397
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,140
<font color="yellow">happy to see you.</font>

398
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

399
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,800
<font color="yellow">Let's see each other often.</font>

400
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,770
<font color="yellow">Is Da Rong doing well?</font>

401
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,270
<font color="yellow">She must have grown a lot.</font>

402
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,440
<font color="yellow">Don't bother.</font>

403
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,470
<font color="yellow">You never cared.</font>

404
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,300
<font color="yellow">Is your step mum nice?</font>

405
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,347
<font color="yellow">Don't ask questions like that.</font>

406
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:45,940
<font color="yellow">You abandoned us so stay out of it.</font>

407
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,430
<font color="yellow">I didn't abandon you.</font>

408
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,040
<font color="yellow">You don't need us.</font>

409
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,870
<font color="yellow">If you're finished, I'm leaving.</font>

410
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,270
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

411
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,940
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

412
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,847
<font color="yellow">You're late, Cho Rong.</font>

413
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:06,870
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry.</font>

414
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,570
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

415
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,570
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

416
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,440
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Geum Sik.</font>

417
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

418
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

419
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,000
<font color="yellow">I won't forget this.</font>

420
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,100
<font color="yellow">Just be good to Gab Soon.</font>

421
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,640
<font color="yellow">I told her you got the money.</font>

422
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,300
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon will feel better that way.</font>

423
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,440
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even pick up my calls.</font>

424
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,663
<font color="yellow">I told her to come straight to the rooftop house.</font>

425
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,230
<font color="yellow">The landlord got the place cleared out.</font>

426
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,470
<font color="yellow">You can move in right away.</font>

427
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,100
<font color="yellow">Is your shoulder strap sturdy?</font>

428
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,160
<font color="yellow">You can't lose it again.</font>

429
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,860
<font color="yellow">I'll guard it with my life.</font>

430
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,200
<font color="yellow">I won't lose it again.</font>

431
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,770
<font color="yellow">Get going. Gab Soon must be waiting.</font>

432
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
<font color="yellow">Taxi!</font>

433
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

434
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry but can you let me off?</font>

435
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,340
<font color="yellow">This is not it.</font>

436
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,600
<font color="yellow">I think this might be right.</font>

437
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,500
<font color="yellow">Is he not here, yet?</font>

438
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,570
<font color="yellow">I thought he left earlier.</font>

439
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,140
<font color="yellow">The landlord is not happy.</font>

440
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,270
<font color="yellow">If she doesn't get the money by today, she'll cancel the contract.</font>

441
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,813
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Are you almost here?</font>

442
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:08,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, wait for a bit. I won't take long.</font>

443
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,060
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Do you know where the community centre is?</font>

444
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,270
<font color="yellow">The community centre?</font>

445
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
<font color="yellow">Let me see...</font>

446
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,940
<font color="yellow">Go straight this way and turn right.</font>

447
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,100
<font color="yellow">- Keep following...
-  I'm not sure if I get you.</font>

448
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry but do you mind taking me there?</font>

449
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,040
<font color="yellow">I'm in a rush. I have to go.</font>

450
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,140
<font color="yellow">I'm from the rural area so I don't know my way around here.</font>

451
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,900
<font color="yellow">I really need to get there.</font>

452
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,970
<font color="yellow">Follow me, then.</font>

453
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,870
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

454
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,423
<font color="yellow">If you turn right from that building, you'll see it.</font>

455
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:51,740
<font color="yellow">- Got it?
-  Yes.</font>

456
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

457
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,840
<font color="yellow">Leave a message after the tone.</font>

458
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,870
<font color="yellow">Is he not picking up?</font>

459
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,540
<font color="yellow">We'll have to cancel the contract.</font>

460
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,340
<font color="yellow">He's coming. Please give him a few more minutes.</font>

461
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,000
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I can say this,</font>

462
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,400
<font color="yellow">but you're too naive.</font>

463
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,340
<font color="yellow">Do you think a boyfriend who wants to move in together is a good man?</font>

464
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,933
<font color="yellow">I'm only saying this because you seem like my daughter.</font>

465
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,370
<font color="yellow">He ran off.</font>

466
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,340
<font color="yellow">He'll never do that.</font>

467
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,340
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Please answer me.</font>

468
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,400
<font color="yellow">- Got it?
-  Yes.</font>

469
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,800
<font color="yellow">Let go, you punk.</font>

470
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
<font color="yellow">I wish we had 10,000 dollars.</font>

471
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,684
<font color="yellow">I'll use 5,000 dollars to pay off my sister's debt...</font>

472
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,613
<font color="yellow">and use the rest for our security deposit.</font>

473
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,257
<font color="yellow">He's a thief.</font>

474
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:31,900
<font color="yellow">Get your act together, young woman.</font>

475
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,670
<font color="yellow">Is he not back, yet? You can't reach him either?</font>

476
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,870
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, I'm going to go crazy.</font>

477
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,600
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm on my way.</font>

478
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,770
<font color="yellow">This one's clingy.</font>

479
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,170
<font color="yellow">How much could it be?</font>

480
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,700
<font color="yellow">We'll see who wins.</font>

481
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,100
<font color="yellow">I'll put my life on the line.</font>

482
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,300
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

483
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,340
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

484
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,600
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

485
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,000
<font color="yellow">- Stop!
-  Hey.</font>

486
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,426
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

487
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:40,470
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

488
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,870
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, go ahead.</font>

489
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,640
<font color="yellow">I told you he ran away.</font>

490
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,540
<font color="yellow">I waited because I felt sorry for you. Let's go now.</font>

491
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,670
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

492
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,970
<font color="yellow">What happened? Why are you hurt?</font>

493
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,840
<font color="yellow">You must have been mugged.</font>

494
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
<font color="yellow">Is he right?</font>

495
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,970
<font color="yellow">What about the money?</font>

496
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,870
<font color="yellow">What happened to the money?</font>

497
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,340
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

498
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,600
<font color="yellow">Aren't you proud of me?</font>

499
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,400
<font color="yellow">How could they do that to you?</font>

500
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,970
<font color="yellow">Look up.</font>

501
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,940
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you go to the hospital?</font>

502
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,740
<font color="yellow">I quit going to the hospital.</font>

503
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,970
<font color="yellow">It's just a beating.</font>

504
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,670
<font color="yellow">I could have beaten them if I had food in my stomach.</font>

505
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,100
<font color="yellow">It's a pity.</font>

506
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,440
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol. I'm so mean.</font>

507
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,340
<font color="yellow">I'm really mean.</font>

508
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,813
<font color="yellow">- I got you wrong.
-  You thought I ran away, right?</font>

509
00:35:28,813 --> 00:35:30,170
<font color="yellow">Why would I run away?</font>

510
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,340
<font color="yellow">Since we were young, although it looked like I won on the outside,</font>

511
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,600
<font color="yellow">you were the actual winner.</font>

512
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,100
<font color="yellow">You tried to understand a narrow-minded person like me.</font>

513
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,670
<font color="yellow">The reason we met for 10 years...</font>

514
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,940
<font color="yellow">is all thanks to you.</font>

515
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,770
<font color="yellow">Others think that it's all my doing.</font>

516
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,540
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

517
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,040
<font color="yellow">You protected our love.</font>

518
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,240
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Gab Dol.</font>

519
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,840
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, you became mature.</font>

520
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,100
<font color="yellow">It's all because of money.</font>

521
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,377
<font color="yellow">Imagine if I had got that stolen.</font>

522
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:12,090
<font color="yellow">"What can you do right? You fool. You stupid fool."</font>

523
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,540
<font color="yellow">"How can I trust a guy like you who gets his money stolen?"</font>

524
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,794
<font color="yellow">"I can't live with you."</font>

525
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:18,040
<font color="yellow">When was I like that?</font>

526
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,070
<font color="yellow">Did your sister really give you the money?</font>

527
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,140
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

528
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,240
<font color="yellow">We'll have a lot to do tomorrow if we're going to move.</font>

529
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,540
<font color="yellow">- Oh no.
-  What should we say?</font>

530
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,970
<font color="yellow">I won't come home tonight.</font>

531
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,740
<font color="yellow">I'm on a business trip to Busan.</font>

532
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,210
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee. Are you there?</font>

533
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,340
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

534
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,000
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

535
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,743
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Ddol Ee?</font>

536
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:14,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Don't disturb my sleep.</font>

537
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,500
<font color="yellow">Were you home?</font>

538
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,710
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen Ddol Ee?
-  Isn't he home?</font>

539
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,740
<font color="yellow">He was here when we were eating pizza.</font>

540
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,343
<font color="yellow">When was that?</font>

541
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,280
<font color="yellow">I think it was about 9pm. We were eating pizza and he came out.</font>

542
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,016
<font color="yellow">I asked if he wanted some, but he went out.</font>

543
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,570
<font color="yellow">How could you let him leave in the night?</font>

544
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,940
<font color="yellow">Then what can I say? He left.</font>

545
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,513
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

546
00:37:55,513 --> 00:37:56,570
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

547
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,600
<font color="yellow">Is there anything wrong?</font>

548
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,740
<font color="yellow">What can go wrong to a person who's asleep?</font>

549
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,640
<font color="yellow">What's the time?</font>

550
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,040
<font color="yellow">It's past 12 o'clock.</font>

551
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,840
<font color="yellow">- Is something wrong?
-  No.</font>

552
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,100
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you saw Ddol Ee.</font>

553
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,210
<font color="yellow">I saw him a few days ago at the supermarket.</font>

554
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,440
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask that?</font>

555
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,540
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

556
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,140
<font color="yellow">- Sleep tight, Mum.
-  Okay.</font>

557
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,170
<font color="yellow">I sent him home early in the day.</font>

558
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,640
<font color="yellow">(Saessak Kindergarten)</font>

559
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,757
<font color="yellow">He's been reported as a missing person. You'll be contacted.</font>

560
00:38:57,757 --> 00:39:00,370
<font color="yellow">We'll go around looking for him. Do what you can.</font>

561
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,770
<font color="yellow">There's a chance that he might have been kidnapped.</font>

562
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,500
<font color="yellow">If you receive a call, record it.</font>

563
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,170
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

564
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,070
<font color="yellow">She's living happily after she remarried.</font>

565
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,340
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

566
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,800
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

567
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,800
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

568
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,640
<font color="yellow">Where did you go?</font>

569
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,140
<font color="yellow">Why are you outside in the middle of the night?</font>

570
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,210
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

571
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,710
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I've been looking for you?</font>

572
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,210
<font color="yellow">Where did you go without telling me?</font>

573
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,970
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I've been looking for you?</font>

574
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,470
<font color="yellow">I thought I lost you.</font>

575
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,670
<font color="yellow">Why did you come outside?</font>

576
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,210
<font color="yellow">Why are you out?</font>

577
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,653
<font color="yellow">I came out to find you.</font>

578
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:27,193
<font color="yellow">You should have slept even if I wasn't home.</font>

579
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:30,400
<font color="yellow">I don't want to stay at home if you're not there.</font>

580
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,900
<font color="yellow">Everyone hates me. They don't even give me pizza.</font>

581
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,670
<font color="yellow">Mum. I'm sleepy.</font>

582
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,000
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

583
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,500
<font color="yellow">It's like a prison for me after the housekeeper was fired.</font>

584
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,947
<font color="yellow">Say something to Grandfather for me.</font>

585
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,770
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if he hires some people,</font>

586
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,740
<font color="yellow">and gives his inheritance to us in advance.</font>

587
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,470
<font color="yellow">Once I receive inheritance, I'm going to buy all that.</font>

588
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,726
<font color="yellow">I can't be satisfied by just looking at it.</font>

589
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:38,113
<font color="yellow">Grandfather scares me too. He's so stubborn.</font>

590
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:41,170
<font color="yellow">Mum, since Grandfather said it's okay,</font>

591
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,940
<font color="yellow">let's watch a movie and eat out.</font>

592
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,494
<font color="yellow">Do you want go dancing?</font>

593
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:45,710
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
-  Yes!</font>

594
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,370
<font color="yellow">Great idea.</font>

595
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,370
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

596
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,600
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, call an ambulance.</font>

597
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,440
<font color="yellow">Call the emergency room.</font>

598
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,686
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

599
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,640
<font color="yellow">I ran up the stairs just a while ago.</font>

600
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,400
<font color="yellow">I can't catch my breath.</font>

601
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:11,370
<font color="yellow">That happens to everyone.</font>

602
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,000
<font color="yellow">It's different this time.</font>

603
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
<font color="yellow">Please be quiet.</font>

604
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,540
<font color="yellow">Is it normal?</font>

605
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,000
<font color="yellow">It's quite normal.</font>

606
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,740
<font color="yellow">I can relax now.</font>

607
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,540
<font color="yellow">This is why we should have a doctor in the house.</font>

608
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,126
<font color="yellow">You're still awake.</font>

609
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:37,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

610
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,440
<font color="yellow">I told you to come home before 10 o'clock.</font>

611
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,800
<font color="yellow">We didn't know it was that late.</font>

612
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,500
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're a kid?</font>

613
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,300
<font color="yellow">Show me the receipt.</font>

614
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,840
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

615
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,100
<font color="yellow">Fill in the housekeeping book and show me.</font>

616
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,400
<font color="yellow">Are you two friends?</font>

617
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,800
<font color="yellow">She's married now. Let her go.</font>

618
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,940
<font color="yellow">Stop hanging out with your mum. It's not good to see.</font>

619
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,840
<font color="yellow">Looking at you two just makes me ill.</font>

620
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,300
<font color="yellow">What kind of a mum are you?</font>

621
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,230
<font color="yellow">Dad. Stop telling me off in front of others.</font>

622
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,540
<font color="yellow">My son-in-law is watching.</font>

623
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,884
<font color="yellow">If you're living under my roof, listen to me.</font>

624
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:15,426
<font color="yellow">It's time for your medication.</font>

625
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,670
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'll bring a cup of water.</font>

626
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

627
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

628
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,470
<font color="yellow">Take Gong Joo upstairs.</font>

629
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,463
<font color="yellow">Let's sleep now. I have an operation early in the morning.</font>

630
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:38,670
<font color="yellow">After I'm done with this. You go ahead and sleep.</font>

631
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,987
<font color="yellow">You need to leave the house?</font>

632
00:43:55,987 --> 00:43:57,850
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to pass the exam.</font>

633
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,500
<font color="yellow">I heard that I don't get along with the vibe of this house.</font>

634
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,080
<font color="yellow">The reason why I fell down and hurt myself in the streets...</font>

635
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,840
<font color="yellow">is because I don't fit with the house.</font>

636
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,540
<font color="yellow">He's saying that this house is full of bad luck.</font>

637
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,300
<font color="yellow">I'm not wrong.</font>

638
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,370
<font color="yellow">What good things happened here?</font>

639
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,330
<font color="yellow">We only went through trouble.</font>

640
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,516
<font color="yellow">You work at the restaurant and I work at the karaoke.</font>

641
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:17,600
<font color="yellow">He's a waiter.</font>

642
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,760
<font color="yellow">Look at you talk.</font>

643
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,380
<font color="yellow">Why is he a waiter?</font>

644
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,870
<font color="yellow">What else can he do if he flunks the exam?</font>

645
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,040
<font color="yellow">He won't find a job at that age.</font>

646
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,970
<font color="yellow">Stop talking like that.</font>

647
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,300
<font color="yellow">So will you pass the exam if you study in another house?</font>

648
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,560
<font color="yellow">- 3,000 percent.
-  You don't need that much.</font>

649
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,840
<font color="yellow">Just pass.</font>

650
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,600
<font color="yellow">We should follow what an expert fortune-teller said.</font>

651
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:43,100
<font color="yellow">I'll go with you to your friend's house tomorrow.</font>

652
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,770
<font color="yellow">There's no need.</font>

653
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,510
<font color="yellow">If you come, you'll spoil the vibe of the house.</font>

654
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,300
<font color="yellow">You have a strong vibe.</font>

655
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,970
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

656
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,240
<font color="yellow">That looks tasty.</font>

657
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,700
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

658
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,070
<font color="yellow">love that.</font>

659
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:09,770
<font color="yellow">This too.</font>

660
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:11,670
<font color="yellow">It looks tasty.</font>

661
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,170
<font color="yellow">He always comes when we're eating.</font>

662
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,300
<font color="yellow">We need to fix a time.</font>

663
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,670
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

664
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,130
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

665
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,097
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
-  Put me upright.</font>

666
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:30,163
<font color="yellow">Put me upright.</font>

667
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:32,253
<font color="yellow">It's been exactly an hour.</font>

668
00:45:32,253 --> 00:45:34,700
<font color="yellow">I'll leave, then.</font>

669
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, woman! Relief Patch!</font>

670
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,140
<font color="yellow">Bring that lady here.</font>

671
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,280
<font color="yellow">Which one?</font>

672
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,570
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch.</font>

673
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,870
<font color="yellow">I won't work there. Look for another person.</font>

674
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,970
<font color="yellow">She won't come.</font>

675
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,740
<font color="yellow">Tell her it's daily wage.</font>

676
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,640
<font color="yellow">We'll pay daily wage.</font>

677
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,930
<font color="yellow">She asks how much we'll pay her.</font>

678
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,553
<font color="yellow">Tell her it'll be more than enough.</font>

679
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:07,970
<font color="yellow">If you will pay.</font>

680
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,370
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll go.</font>

681
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,940
<font color="yellow">I cleaned it.</font>

682
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,900
<font color="yellow">Sit on it.</font>

683
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,900
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

684
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,340
<font color="yellow">On the bed.</font>

685
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,770
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

686
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,970
<font color="yellow">- Garlic.
-  Powdered red pepper.</font>

687
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,840
<font color="yellow">Then, salt.</font>

688
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,140
<font color="yellow">I'll let it slide this time because of the money.</font>

689
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,640
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

690
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing.
-  Put in some more.</font>

691
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,440
<font color="yellow">- More.
-  What are you doing?</font>

692
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,300
<font color="yellow">I'm making doenjang jjigae.</font>

693
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,800
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if he ate something simple like a salad.</font>

694
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,360
<font color="yellow">Without the housekeeper, I'm going through all these trouble.</font>

695
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,190
<font color="yellow">Grandfather is so old-fashioned.</font>

696
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,100
<font color="yellow">He always wants these stuff.</font>

697
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,040
<font color="yellow">Move over.</font>

698
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you measuring it with all this?</font>

699
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,470
<font color="yellow">You can measure with your eye.</font>

700
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,630
<font color="yellow">Do you know how to make it?</font>

701
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,500
<font color="yellow">Doenjang jjigae is easy.</font>

702
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,940
<font color="yellow">I can't guarantee the taste, though.</font>

703
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,970
<font color="yellow">Come and have supper.</font>

704
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you empty-handed?</font>

705
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,170
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
-  I asked for a glass of water.</font>

706
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,300
<font color="yellow">Where are your senses?</font>

707
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,470
<font color="yellow">I left it in the refrigerator at my home.</font>

708
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,100
<font color="yellow">Quit if you're going to be like that.</font>

709
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,920
<font color="yellow">How could you be this annoying?</font>

710
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,770
<font color="yellow">Don't live your life like that.</font>

711
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,100
<font color="yellow">I don't know how much you have left of it though.</font>

712
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,540
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch!</font>

713
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,170
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

714
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,777
<font color="yellow">It's not like you bought a relief patch for me.</font>

715
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:17,970
<font color="yellow">I'm not called Relief Patch, my name is Nam Gi Ja.</font>

716
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,070
<font color="yellow">Nam Gi Ja.</font>

717
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,470
<font color="yellow">How much are you going to leave?</font>

718
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,677
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

719
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:25,123
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

720
00:48:25,123 --> 00:48:27,170
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to come here in the first place.</font>

721
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,970
<font color="yellow">Send me the wage to my account.</font>

722
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,070
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch!</font>

723
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,040
<font color="yellow">Did you make it?</font>

724
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,290
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  Did you buy it?</font>

725
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:58,160
<font color="yellow">- We didn't buy it.
-  Then?</font>

726
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,270
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch made it.</font>

727
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,970
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch made it?</font>

728
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,600
<font color="yellow">Is it bad?</font>

729
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,023
<font color="yellow">Dad. I'll do what I want with my marriage.</font>

730
00:49:13,023 --> 00:49:14,800
<font color="yellow">I'll marry who I want to marry.</font>

731
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,070
<font color="yellow">How could you freeze all my credit cards?</font>

732
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,170
<font color="yellow">Do as you please!</font>

733
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,650
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
-  Oh no.</font>

734
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,240
<font color="yellow">It's because of me, right?</font>

735
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,840
<font color="yellow">Since I don't suit your family.</font>

736
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,387
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy your food, Sir.</font>

737
00:49:40,387 --> 00:49:41,470
<font color="yellow">I'm in the middle of a conversation.</font>

738
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,570
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

739
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,340
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

740
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,840
<font color="yellow">It's just some discomfort.</font>

741
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,370
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

742
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,340
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your food.</font>

743
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

744
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,840
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
-  What's with this?</font>

745
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,500
<font color="yellow">I'd like the usual.</font>

746
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,470
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

747
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,940
<font color="yellow">I'll bring a new dish.</font>

748
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,970
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

749
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,840
<font color="yellow">How much is that?</font>

750
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,440
<font color="yellow">I don't have any cash.</font>

751
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,470
<font color="yellow">I have cash on me.</font>

752
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,870
<font color="yellow">Give me all you have.</font>

753
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,270
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sir.</font>

754
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,300
<font color="yellow">Here's 10 percent. Is that enough?</font>

755
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,540
<font color="yellow">Get a grip.</font>

756
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:57,970
<font color="yellow">What if you get caught?</font>

757
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,700
<font color="yellow">Is your dad doing well?</font>

758
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,470
<font color="yellow">You're eating well, aren't you?</font>

759
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,033
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

760
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:06,140
<font color="yellow">Kid.</font>

761
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,640
<font color="yellow">This is pretty. I'll have this.</font>

762
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,870
<font color="yellow">I'd like all of these.</font>

763
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,940
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

764
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,300
<font color="yellow">Dad. Let's have a party.</font>

765
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,190
<font color="yellow">Why have a party?</font>

766
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,370
<font color="yellow">What did he do well?</font>

767
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,370
<font color="yellow">He'll have a tough time when he moves out.</font>

768
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,470
<font color="yellow">We need to let him eat some meat.</font>

769
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,500
<font color="yellow">Bring out the pork belly. I bought some earlier today.</font>

770
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,170
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

771
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,770
<font color="yellow">Did you cook meat?</font>

772
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,040
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

773
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,540
<font color="yellow">You can't cook samgyeopsal here without my permission.</font>

774
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,170
<font color="yellow">It's not samgyeopsal.</font>

775
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,640
<font color="yellow">It's rib eye.</font>

776
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,863
<font color="yellow">- What should we do?
-  What's the problem?</font>

777
00:53:14,863 --> 00:53:16,670
<font color="yellow">We can still go out and eat.</font>

778
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:17,770
<font color="yellow">It's our house.</font>

779
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,540
<font color="yellow">We moved to a nice place.</font>

780
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,840
<font color="yellow">A detached house is the best.</font>

781
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,640
<font color="yellow">I don't like apartments.</font>

782
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,850
<font color="yellow">You're renting a room. You're in no position to say such a thing.</font>

783
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,600
<font color="yellow">How can they eat rib eye when they're renting a room?</font>

784
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,570
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to live like that, get a grip on yourselves.</font>

785
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,884
<font color="yellow">You can lose a grip once in a while.</font>

786
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:45,540
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, it will be so tiring.</font>

787
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,570
<font color="yellow">You're right. You're the best.</font>

788
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,840
<font color="yellow">I'll visit your karaoke sometime later.</font>

789
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,440
<font color="yellow">My expectation makes me imagine how it would be.</font>

790
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,600
<font color="yellow">Your imagination is what makes you expect.</font>

791
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,070
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing.</font>

792
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,840
<font color="yellow">What do you expect and imagine?</font>

793
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,580
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you that.</font>

794
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,440
<font color="yellow">There is no one in this town as beautiful as your daughter.</font>

795
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,613
<font color="yellow">Stop it. That's not a compliment.</font>

796
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:18,700
<font color="yellow">That's why we ended up having a life like this.</font>

797
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,890
<font color="yellow">Ms Karaoke. Which cosmetics do you use?</font>

798
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,170
<font color="yellow">I'm not telling you that.</font>

799
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I've had enough of this rib eye.</font>

800
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,900
<font color="yellow">Do you want an exchange?</font>

801
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,347
<font color="yellow">Is 1 piece of rib eye for 3 pieces of samgyeopsal okay?</font>

802
00:54:32,347 --> 00:54:34,370
<font color="yellow">You all know Korean beef is expensive, right?</font>

803
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:36,677
<font color="yellow">Make it two pieces.</font>

804
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:37,800
<font color="yellow">I'll give you some kimchi.</font>

805
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,600
<font color="yellow">We have a deal.</font>

806
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,470
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

807
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,970
<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

808
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,640
<font color="yellow">It just melts away.</font>

809
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,570
<font color="yellow">Try it, Mum.</font>

810
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,640
<font color="yellow">It's as good as it costs.</font>

811
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,526
<font color="yellow">- You've never eaten rib eye before.
-  What did you say?</font>

812
00:55:06,526 --> 00:55:09,800
<font color="yellow">You should just swallow rib eye, not chew it.</font>

813
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,970
<font color="yellow">It just slips down your throat.</font>

814
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,087
<font color="yellow">Let me give you some advice.</font>

815
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:23,570
<font color="yellow">If you want to barbecue, get the permission from the main building.</font>

816
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,660
<font color="yellow">There is no such rule.</font>

817
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,200
<font color="yellow">I just made one up.</font>

818
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,170
<font color="yellow">Eat up, so you can go and study from tomorrow.</font>

819
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,100
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live with a girl?</font>

820
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,200
<font color="yellow">That's not what I said.</font>

821
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,940
<font color="yellow">I said he will go and study.</font>

822
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,740
<font color="yellow">Is he hard of hearing?</font>

823
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,570
<font color="yellow">It does sound similar in a way.</font>

824
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,840
<font color="yellow">Study, live together.</font>

825
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,500
<font color="yellow">What do you do for living?</font>

826
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,200
<font color="yellow">Are you a gilder?</font>

827
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,940
<font color="yellow">- Why do you ask? It's obvious.
-  Why is it obvious?</font>

828
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,340
<font color="yellow">Don't look down on us just because we're renters.</font>

829
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,900
<font color="yellow">I used to...</font>

830
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,870
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's funny.</font>

831
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,200
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I guess our family is truly unlucky.</font>

832
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,040
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Look at them.</font>

833
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,870
<font color="yellow">I don't know if they're gilders, but they are like...</font>

834
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,140
<font color="yellow">two pieces of gold whose coating is peeling off.</font>

835
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,536
<font color="yellow">You work at a restaurant, I work at a karaoke...</font>

836
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:16,640
<font color="yellow">and you're jobless.</font>

837
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:20,100
<font color="yellow">This is a very rare mix of unsuccessful people.</font>

838
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,070
<font color="yellow">Leave Gab Dol out of it.</font>

839
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,653
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

840
00:56:23,653 --> 00:56:25,370
<font color="yellow">I want to move out.</font>

841
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,070
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

842
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,070
<font color="yellow">I got you.</font>

843
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,533
<font color="yellow">You're staying in Seoul, right?</font>

844
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:51,900
<font color="yellow">Who are you? Do I know you?</font>

845
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,900
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

846
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,100
<font color="yellow">You little brat. Let's go.</font>

847
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,340
<font color="yellow">Let's go to your mum and dad.</font>

848
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,200
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?</font>

849
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,470
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'm crazy. Let's go.</font>

850
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,400
<font color="yellow">- Help me!
-  My gosh.</font>

851
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,270
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Gab Soon!</font>

852
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,440
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

853
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,900
<font color="yellow">You little brat!</font>

854
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:13,540
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, you crazy girl!</font>

855
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,840
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

856
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,870
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon!</font>

857
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,300
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

858
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:28,740
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

859
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,140
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

860
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,500
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

861
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,570
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

862
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,340
<font color="yellow">Take her to the hospital. She's out of her mind.</font>

863
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,470
<font color="yellow">- Get up. Let's go to the hospital.
-  Joong Nyeon.</font>

864
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,070
<font color="yellow">It drives me crazy when something like this happens.</font>

865
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,370
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon is wandering around Seoul.</font>

866
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,040
<font color="yellow">Is this Seokbulsa Temple?</font>

867
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,170
<font color="yellow">Please speak up.</font>

868
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,740
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

869
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:06,200
<font color="yellow">A student who studies here?</font>

870
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,116
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Don't worry.</font>

871
00:58:11,116 --> 00:58:14,960
<font color="yellow">She's studying hard with a band tied around her head.</font>

872
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,370
<font color="yellow">All right. Thank you.</font>

873
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,100
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

874
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,670
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

875
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,940
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

876
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,870
<font color="yellow">The sky knows, the land knows,</font>

877
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,370
<font color="yellow">I know and everyone knows.</font>

878
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,400
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

879
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:41,620
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof.</font>

880
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,700
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What a lonely life.</font>

881
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,200
<font color="yellow">What a lonely life! My gosh.</font>

882
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,340
<font color="yellow">You've been holding out since you were in school.</font>

883
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,777
<font color="yellow">You're talented and you've gained academic recognition.</font>

884
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:01,900
<font color="yellow">Whenever I go into the operating room, I get nervous.</font>

885
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,540
<font color="yellow">I still don't want you to make a decision so hastily.</font>

886
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,600
<font color="yellow">I'm not brave enough anyway.</font>

887
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,170
<font color="yellow">I know...</font>

888
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,740
<font color="yellow">what my family and my wife's family expect from me.</font>

889
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,440
<font color="yellow">I have no choice but to be a doctor for the rest of my life.</font>

890
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,740
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to some place else? It's boring here.</font>

891
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,700
<font color="yellow">Shall we go to our school? It's been a while.</font>

892
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,240
<font color="yellow">(Ms Yeo)</font>

893
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,440
<font color="yellow">You should answer it.</font>

894
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,516
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  It's me.</font>

895
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:42,720
<font color="yellow">You should come straight home from work.</font>

896
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,800
<font color="yellow">You know my dad doesn't like it if you don't.</font>

897
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,300
<font color="yellow">He's in a bad mood today. Make an appointment at the hospital.</font>

898
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:49,940
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

899
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,500
<font color="yellow">- Let's go to the school.
-  No. You should go home.</font>

900
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,340
<font color="yellow">You can go ahead. I'm not drunk.</font>

901
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk, either.</font>

902
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,670
<font color="yellow">- Sir. Please take her home safe.
-  Okay.</font>

903
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,300
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
-  Man Joo.</font>

904
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

905
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,340
<font color="yellow">One bottle of soju, please.</font>

906
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,740
<font color="yellow">I will carry it for you.</font>

907
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,540
<font color="yellow">It will bring me bad luck. I'm not supposed to see you for a while.</font>

908
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,600
<font color="yellow">Let's listen to the fortune-teller.</font>

909
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,840
<font color="yellow">You didn't get caught, right?</font>

910
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,923
<font color="yellow">Of course not. She wanted to come with me,</font>

911
01:02:07,923 --> 01:02:09,974
<font color="yellow">but I refused saying it's bad luck.</font>

912
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:11,850
<font color="yellow">My mum is so clingy.</font>

913
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:14,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that already? Let's clean up here.</font>

914
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,700
<font color="yellow">We have to go grocery shopping.</font>

915
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,240
<font color="yellow">Wait. I want to say something.</font>

916
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,570
<font color="yellow">I know you'll say you want to hug me. Forget it.</font>

917
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:35,740
