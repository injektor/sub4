<font color="yellow">Did you kick him out while I was gone?</font>

51
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:20,594
<font color="yellow">I didn't kick him out.</font>

52
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:24,324
<font color="yellow">He probably left because you badger him and make him feel lonely.</font>

53
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:26,534
<font color="yellow">How do I make him feel miserable?</font>

54
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,164
<font color="yellow">My brother worked all his life to earn a living.</font>

55
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,094
<font color="yellow">You should treat him like a head of the household.</font>

56
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:35,094
<font color="yellow">You've been mean to him since his retirement.</font>

57
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:36,964
<font color="yellow">You had to get rid of his pile of junk.</font>

58

<font color="yellow">How could he live comfortably here?</font>

59
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:43,064
<font color="yellow">You must've said something to make him go to Sokcho. It's true.</font>

60
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:44,964
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting on my case, too?</font>

61
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,994
<font color="yellow">You have no idea about what's going on between us.</font>

62
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:49,094
<font color="yellow">I have a very good idea about what's going on.</font>

63
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:52,464
<font color="yellow">I've watched you guys since the day you got married.</font>

64
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:55,194
<font color="yellow">Honestly, my brother is really a good person.</font>

65
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:58,624
<font color="yellow">If there's another one like him, I would propose to him just like that.</font>

66
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:00,394
<font color="yellow">Don't say that unless you've lived with him.</font>

67
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,094
<font color="yellow">Did I not live with him?</font>

68
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,794
<font color="yellow">Living as a sibling is not the same as living as a couple.</font>

69
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:05,294
<font color="yellow">Look around.</font>

70
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:08,424
<font color="yellow">Do you know how bad other husbands are?</font>

71
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:11,694
<font color="yellow">Does he gamble, cheat on you, or beat you?</font>

72
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:14,264
<font color="yellow">Other women would be glad to have someone like my brother.</font>

73
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,624
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

74
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:19,864
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that he's the type that causes grief quietly?</font>

75
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:23,024
<font color="yellow">People say that I'm the evil one because I scream and yell.</font>

76
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:25,694
<font color="yellow">He's so selfish and cold.</font>

77
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:29,624
<font color="yellow">He only thinks about himself and do things without telling me.</font>

78
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,524
<font color="yellow">He's so devious.</font>

79
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:34,424
<font color="yellow">I found that out the hard way.</font>

80
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,464
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I've lived with him for 40 years.</font>

81
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,894
<font color="yellow">If you say that someone like my brother is devious,</font>

82
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,964
<font color="yellow">you're not a human being.</font>

83
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:44,324
<font color="yellow">You should keep loyal to your husband.</font>

84
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:46,294
<font color="yellow">You disrespect him because he doesn't work.</font>

85
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:48,424
<font color="yellow">You'll be punished.</font>

86
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,724
<font color="yellow">I'm being punished right now.</font>

87
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,024
<font color="yellow">You should go, too. I don't want to see you.</font>

88
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:55,024
<font color="yellow">I'd love to.</font>

89
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:57,724
<font color="yellow">You threw out your husband and now his sister, too.</font>

90
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:00,864
<font color="yellow">I hope you have a nice life without us.</font>

91
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,694
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

92
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:06,194
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

93
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:07,494
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

94
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,264

00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:54,864
<font color="yellow">but I had nowhere to go.</font>

155
00:10:56,694 --> 00:11:00,564
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to come here with Ddol Ee and a suitcase again.</font>

156
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,624
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

157
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,794
<font color="yellow">I know it's embarrassing and upsetting, but help me this once.</font>

158
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:09,424
<font color="yellow">I won't stay for long.</font>

159
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:11,224
<font color="yellow">Is it about the girls' birth mother?</font>

160
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:14,894
<font color="yellow">- Did Geum Sik tell you to leave? - It's not that.</font>

161
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:18,964
<font color="yellow">You should tell me what it is.</font>

162
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:21,164
<font color="yellow">Just give me a few days.</font>

163
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:27,424
<font color="yellow">The doctor told you not to move.</font>

164
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,394
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

165
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,124
<font color="yellow">I should call the doctor.</font>

166
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,464
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

167
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,494
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

168
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:43,124
<font color="yellow">They said you should stay here for a few more days.</font>

169
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:46,564
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's so urgent, but please stay.</font>

170
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:48,024
<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself.</font>

171
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:52,524
<font color="yellow">You ruined my life.</font>

172
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,524
<font color="yellow">You're a hopeless woman.</font>

173
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,894
<font color="yellow">Don't ever show your face again.</font>

174
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:00,794
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

175
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:12,364
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why is he being so cold?</font>

176
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:14,224
<font color="yellow">Did you cause the accident?</font>

177
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:28,194
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

178
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:30,224
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

179
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:33,424
<font color="yellow">You should've called us. You didn't even have a big surgery.</font>

180
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:35,994
<font color="yellow">It was just a broken bone. This is ridiculous.</font>

181
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:38,894
<font color="yellow">We stalled them for three hours, but you didn't come or call.</font>

182
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:42,724
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? That deal was the reason for my investment.</font>

183
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,494
<font color="yellow">How will you take the responsibility?</font>

184
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:46,464
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it no matter what.</font>

185
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:50,194
<font color="yellow">I won't let the stockholders suffer any loss.</font>

186
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,164
<font color="yellow">All you needed to do was make a call.</font>

187
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:53,994
<font color="yellow">How could you lose your phone at a time like that?</font>

188
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:57,624
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

189
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,264
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

190
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:03,694
<font color="yellow">- Dad! - Dad!</font>

191
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:04,894
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, Da Rong.</font>

192
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:07,464
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

193
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,694
<font color="yellow">Don't cry. I'm fine.</font>

194
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,124
<font color="yellow">- Have you eaten? - No.</font>

195
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:17,394
<font color="yellow">- Does it hurt a lot? - It doesn't hurt at all.</font>

196
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,164
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine after I remove the cast.</font>

197
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:22,164
<font color="yellow">Shall we order some Chinese food?</font>

198
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,824
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. You should rest.</font>

199
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:26,264
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

200
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,464
<font color="yellow">Why are you going in and out?</font>

201
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:24,524
<font color="yellow">I thought you were asleep.</font>

202
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,264
<font color="yellow">Is it because of the job hunting?</font>

203
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:27,994
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

204
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:31,024
<font color="yellow">There will be a way for us to make a living.</font>

205
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:35,094
<font color="yellow">I'll make money no matter what.</font>

206
00:14:49,494 --> 00:14:50,564
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

207
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:06,824
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

208
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,894
<font color="yellow">What made Geum Sik so angry?</font>

209
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:12,194
<font color="yellow">I've never seen him so scary like that.</font>

210
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:16,094
<font color="yellow">He turned the wheel to save you. Why is he so upset?</font>

211
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,564
<font color="yellow">How did you get into the accident? Tell me.</font>

212
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:36,564
<font color="yellow">- Don't answer it. - Let go of me!</font>

213
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,124
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

214
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:06,894
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

215
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,594
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - I was visiting my aunt.</font>

216
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,264
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

217
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:17,764
<font color="yellow">I'm running an errand for my mum.</font>

218
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:21,294
<font color="yellow">We're doing a big house cleaning tomorrow. I got this from my sister.</font>

219
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,324
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

220
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:26,324
<font color="yellow">I saw your blog. You're starting a cleaning business.</font>

221
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,824
<font color="yellow">Did you give up becoming a teacher?</font>

222
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:32,094
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol passed his exam. Aren't you two getting married?</font>

223
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:35,724
<font color="yellow">What if Gab Dol's mother finds out about your business?</font>

224
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:38,524
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

225
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,464
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the reunion.</font>

226
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:41,824
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

227
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:54,394
<font color="yellow">You're here, Jae Soon.</font>

228
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:57,164
<font color="yellow">- You must be tired. Have you eaten? - I have.</font>

229
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:00,124
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask for trouble?</font>

230
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:02,364
<font color="yellow">You should just study.</font>

231
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:05,894
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that. Where is Mum?</font>

232
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:08,694
<font color="yellow">She went in to her room to sleep.</font>

233
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:10,794
<font color="yellow">Did you stay to see me?</font>

234
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:13,724
<font color="yellow">No. I'll be staying here for a while.</font>

235
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:17,124
<font color="yellow">What? Did something happen?</font>

236
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:20,624
<font color="yellow">Do me a favour, and don't ask me anything.</font>

237
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:23,664
<font color="yellow">Just for a while. Don't tell Dad.</font>

238
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,924
<font color="yellow">Mum was so upset,</font>

239
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:28,264
<font color="yellow">but I told her to give me time to think.</font>

240
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:32,024
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it is,</font>

241
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:34,724
<font color="yellow">but I don't want you to hold yourself back any more.</font>

242
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:39,334
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon. Don't think about anything else.</font>

243
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:43,064
<font color="yellow">Just focus on yourself. It's your life, not anyone else's.</font>

244
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,694
<font color="yellow">Your words mean the world to me.</font>

245
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,064
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Gab Soon.</font>

246
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:03,694
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

247
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:09,094
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

248
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:11,594
<font color="yellow">Where is Ms Shin?</font>

249
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,064
<font color="yellow">She went to take care of some urgent business.</font>

250
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:17,594
<font color="yellow">She'll be back in a few days.</font>

251
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,624
<font color="yellow">I wish she were here.</font>

252
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:23,724
<font color="yellow">Did she leave because of us?</font>

253
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,094
<font color="yellow">No. She'll be back.</font>

254
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:29,264
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong. You should help me for a while.</font>

255
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,764
<font color="yellow">I'll be busy with important work at the company.</font>

256
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,364
<font color="yellow">Take good care of Da Rong,</font>

257
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:43,494
<font color="yellow">and order food with this. Can you do it for me?</font>

258
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:52,294
<font color="yellow">Se Gye. You're leaving early.</font>

259
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,524
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Get in.</font>

260
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:58,064
<font color="yellow">-It's okay. - I'll give you a ride. Get in.</font>

261
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,594
<font color="yellow">There's no need to use two cars.</font>

262
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,464
<font color="yellow">Do you remember my friends you met before?</font>

263
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,194
<font color="yellow">Make appointments for them for next week.</font>

264
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:13,124
<font color="yellow">They can call the hospital and do it themselves.</font>

265
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:15,394
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

266
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:18,764
<font color="yellow">Pull some strings and get your chief treat them.</font>

267
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:21,024
<font color="yellow">That's illegal.</font>

268
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:23,294
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

269
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:24,924
<font color="yellow">That's illegal, too.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Cho Rok National University Hospital)</font>

271
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:33,764
<font color="yellow">Get off. Talking to you makes me so frustrated.</font>

272
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,624
<font color="yellow">- Drive safely. - I'm not driving yet.</font>

273
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:12,424
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd come.</font>

274
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,194
<font color="yellow">I came because of my mother-in-law.</font>

275
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:15,924
<font color="yellow">You're not answering the chief's calls.</font>

276
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:18,894
<font color="yellow">He wants to talk to you in person.</font>

277
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:22,164
<font color="yellow">I sent him an email and told him I have nothing to say...</font>

278

<font color="yellow">regarding that matter.</font>

279
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,334
<font color="yellow">I'll pay him a visit later.</font>

280
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:28,494
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

281
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,024

284
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:33,834
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me?</font>

285
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,224
<font color="yellow">Were you planning to leave without me?</font>

286
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:40,764
<font color="yellow">I went through so much to find you during the Korean War.</font>

287
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:42,494
<font color="yellow">I wasn't even born then.</font>

288
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:45,794
<font color="yellow">- Why did you come here? - Be honest with me.</font>

289
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:49,024
<font color="yellow">Did Nae Shim tell you to leave? Did she kick you out?</font>

290
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,724
<font color="yellow">I came here myself. It was too lonely to stay in Seoul.</font>

291
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:54,464
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you a meal. Eat and go home.</font>

292
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,694
<font color="yellow">I don't need you to buy me a meal. I'll stay here, too.</font>

293
00:21:57,864 --> 00:21:59,794
<font color="yellow">I can barely take care of myself.</font>

294
00:22:00,094 --> 00:22:02,324
<font color="yellow">Just go home. I can't look after you.</font>

295
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:05,294
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I can take care of myself.</font>

296
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:09,864
<font color="yellow">Here. Take this. It's a little pocket money for you.</font>

297
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:13,024
<font color="yellow">- Where did you get it? - I'm not telling you.</font>

298
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:17,824
<font color="yellow">It's not bad money. You can take it.</font>

299
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:19,664
<font color="yellow">Take it.</font>

300
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:24,194
<font color="yellow">It's my first time to receive money from you.</font>

301
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:27,424
<font color="yellow">Be a good brother, and I'll often give you money.</font>

302
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:30,064
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

303
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:33,964
<font color="yellow">As I see you here, you look like a bumpkin.</font>

304
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:36,994

00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:27,094
<font color="yellow">I heard you said you didn't have time for Gab Dol.</font>

459
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:29,164
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm working.</font>

460
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:32,794
<font color="yellow">I met him today. He looks handsome.</font>

461
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:34,764
<font color="yellow">Any girl would die to meet him.</font>

462
00:33:35,494 --> 00:33:37,694
<font color="yellow">- He's a public official. - Mum.</font>

463
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:41,364
<font color="yellow">His mum wouldn't be able to do anything if her son likes you.</font>

464
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:45,464
<font color="yellow">You only need to see her once or twice a year.</font>

465
00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:49,424
<font color="yellow">The couple is the most important. Who cares about the parents?</font>

466
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:52,824
<font color="yellow">- Get out. - You're just a cleaner.</font>

467
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,664
<font color="yellow">Don't play hard to get.</font>

468
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:56,624
<font color="yellow">You need to hang onto Gab Dol!</font>

469
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:59,164
<font color="yellow">You should come to your senses!</font>

470
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,524
<font color="yellow">Get out, Mum.</font>

471
00:34:14,794 --> 00:34:15,864
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

472
00:34:16,394 --> 00:34:19,164
<font color="yellow">- How's everything? - What's the matter?</font>

473
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:22,994
<font color="yellow">- Is something wrong? - Nothing's wrong.</font>

474
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:25,394
<font color="yellow">I had a few drinks.</font>

475
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:27,424
<font color="yellow">Do you have good news?</font>

476
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,464
<font color="yellow">I had a few drinks with my colleagues.</font>

477
00:34:30,364 --> 00:34:31,664
<font color="yellow">How is it there?</font>

478
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:34,064
<font color="yellow">Isn't it cold? Have you eaten?</font>

479
00:34:35,894 --> 00:34:38,364
<font color="yellow">I'll make time and go see you soon.</font>

480
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:40,864
<font color="yellow">There's no need. I know you're busy.</font>

481
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:43,294
<font color="yellow">I'm not busy.</font>

482
00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:46,364
<font color="yellow">Is there something wrong?</font>

483
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,234
<font color="yellow">You've never called late at night.</font>

484
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:53,424
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to call you in the middle of the night.</font>

485
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:57,694
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I wasn't a good son.</font>

486
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:01,994
<font color="yellow">I'll be a good son from now on.</font>

487
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:06,464
<font color="yellow">Dad. Don't do dangerous work.</font>

488
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:08,524
<font color="yellow">You might hurt yourself.</font>

489
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:11,764
<font color="yellow">All right. Don't worry about me and go home.</font>

490
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:14,064
<font color="yellow">Your wife would be worried.</font>

491
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:17,364
<font color="yellow">Don't drink too much.</font>

492
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,594
<font color="yellow">All right. Go home.</font>

493
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,094
<font color="yellow">This is it, right?</font>

494
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,364
<font color="yellow">This is a big house. We won't be able to finish it in four hours.</font>

495
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:37,624
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

496
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,094
<font color="yellow">- Right. - Gab Soon, you're the best.</font>

497
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:42,564
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

498
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:46,164
<font color="yellow">I was going to text you.</font>

499
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:49,394
<font color="yellow">But it was too long so I called.</font>

500
00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:51,764
<font color="yellow">I called a cleaning company.</font>

501
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:54,764
<font color="yellow">So don't do anything. Just boss them around.</font>

502
00:35:55,594 --> 00:35:56,894
<font color="yellow">Don't lift a finger.</font>

503
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:59,734
<font color="yellow">- Don't use your knee. - Okay.</font>

504
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:01,694
<font color="yellow">It must be them.</font>

505
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,494
<font color="yellow">I won't lift a finger nor will I use my knee.</font>

506
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:08,424
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

507
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:10,424
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - We're here to clean.</font>

508
00:36:10,964 --> 00:36:13,164
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Be careful.</font>

509
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:16,394
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

510
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:26,424
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo told us to take orders from you.</font>

511
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:28,494
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

512
00:36:28,494 --> 00:36:30,924
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, where should we focus on?</font>

513
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,624
<font color="yellow">Is there such a thing in cleaning?</font>

514
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,124
<font color="yellow">You need to do it well.</font>

515
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:38,424
<font color="yellow">Every nook and cranny.</font>

516
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,794
<font color="yellow">Behind the toilet and the light switch.</font>

517
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,924
<font color="yellow">Don't forget the entrance floor or the slime and dirt.</font>

518
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:46,264
<font color="yellow">I see. You heard what she said, right?</font>

519
00:36:46,894 --> 00:36:48,624
<font color="yellow">- Take good care of the toilet. - Okay.</font>

520
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,824
<font color="yellow">Get a move on it.</font>

521
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:53,764
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, please tell us what do to.</font>

522
00:36:54,324 --> 00:36:56,094
<font color="yellow">All right. Get a start on it.</font>

523
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:57,234
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Ma'am. - Yes, Ma'am.</font>

524
00:36:57,394 --> 00:36:58,694
<font color="yellow">Let's get a move on it.</font>

525
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,524
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time.</font>

526
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:02,324
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

527
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:03,394
<font color="yellow">Toilet!</font>

528
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:05,824
<font color="yellow">Start with the bedroom toilet.</font>

529
00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:41,264
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

530
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,624
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this. I thought you were going to be a teacher.</font>

531
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:46,994
<font color="yellow">You're an undergraduate. What are you doing here?</font>

532
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:49,094
<font color="yellow">Are you working part time here?</font>

533
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,794
<font color="yellow">I'm only a part time now, but I'll found my own cleaning service.</font>

534
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:52,824
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

535
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:56,294
<font color="yellow">That's the end of you.</font>

536
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,294
<font color="yellow">Do your parents know what you're up to?</font>

537
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,694
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because I feel sorry for you.</font>

538
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,624
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about getting close with my son.</font>

539
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:09,094
<font color="yellow">I have advice for you. Study.</font>

540
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:11,594
<font color="yellow">Who'd want you to be a daughter-in-law?</font>

541
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:14,424
<font color="yellow">Think of your mum.</font>

542
00:38:14,864 --> 00:38:16,394
<font color="yellow">How could you be so thoughtless?</font>

543
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,494
<font color="yellow">Scrub this clean.</font>

544
00:38:19,594 --> 00:38:21,494
<font color="yellow">The slime and dirt here.</font>

545
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,464
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

546
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:53,894
<font color="yellow">- Mum, enjoy. - Okay.</font>

547
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,264
<font color="yellow">Se Gye wanted to apologise,</font>

548
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:58,664
<font color="yellow">so he specially made time for us.</font>

549
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,564
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy yourself.</font>

550
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:03,994
<font color="yellow">How kind of you.</font>

551
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,894
<font color="yellow">- Ms Yeo. - Yes?</font>

552
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,894
<font color="yellow">What is it? Tell me.</font>

553
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,964
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, why are you like that?</font>

554
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,264
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

555
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,094
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

556
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:29,494
<font color="yellow">Did you pack everything?</font>

557
00:39:29,594 --> 00:39:30,894
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Yes.</font>

558
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:32,764
<font color="yellow">I have everything here.</font>

559
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:50,064
<font color="yellow">It's quite all right.</font>

560
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,994
<font color="yellow">Toilet. You did well.</font>

561
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,564
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

562
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:56,094
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

563
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:59,394
<font color="yellow">If you're dissatisfied, please call us.</font>

564
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:01,364
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

565
00:40:01,824 --> 00:40:03,294
<font color="yellow">You all did well today.</font>

566
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:04,894
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Ma'am.</font>

567
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:06,624
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

568
00:40:09,364 --> 00:40:10,464
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

569
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:14,564
<font color="yellow">I thought you had something to say.</font>

570
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:17,564
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing. - Be careful.</font>

571
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:20,694
<font color="yellow">Grandfather must have called the cleaning service.</font>

572
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:28,564
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon!</font>

573
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:30,564
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

574
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:34,394
<font color="yellow">- Who is she? - She's my sister-in-law.</font>

575
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:36,524
<font color="yellow">You saw her at the wedding.</font>

576
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:38,764
<font color="yellow">She's my sister.</font>

577
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:40,624
<font color="yellow">Your sister?</font>

578
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,494
<font color="yellow">She's a cleaner?</font>

579
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,064
<font color="yellow">I don't know when he'll be back.</font>

580
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:22,624
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for my son-in-law?</font>

581
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:25,064
<font color="yellow">I have my reasons.</font>

582
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:26,994
<font color="yellow">He's not in.</font>

583
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:32,264
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why I run into you so often.</font>

584
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:35,234
<font color="yellow">As a mother of a daughter, I believe that...</font>

585
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,894
<font color="yellow">you'd understand so I'll say just one thing.</font>

586
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:40,194
<font color="yellow">Don't be upset.</font>

587
00:41:40,694 --> 00:41:43,394
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik and your daughter got a divorce.</font>

588
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:45,624
<font color="yellow">He got a divorce and now he has a family.</font>

589
00:41:45,624 --> 00:41:47,964
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't disturb that.</font>

590
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:51,024
<font color="yellow">If you got a divorce, you should leave it.</font>

591
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:54,234
<font color="yellow">They have two daughters. How can they become strangers?</font>

592
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:57,424
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't go trying to tempt an ex husband.</font>

593
00:41:57,524 --> 00:41:59,164
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

594
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:01,624
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are?</font>

595
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:02,624
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

596
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:07,564
<font color="yellow">That's why my daughter's at home.</font>

597
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:11,164
<font color="yellow">If it was some other woman, she wouldn't have let you be.</font>

598
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:13,664
<font color="yellow">My daughter's too nice.</font>

599
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,664
<font color="yellow">She's at home?</font>

600
00:42:16,294 --> 00:42:18,234
<font color="yellow">She's being patient.</font>

601
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,364
<font color="yellow">I hope we never meet.</font>

602
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:24,964
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

603
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:28,324
<font color="yellow">I have one favour to ask.</font>

604
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:31,564
<font color="yellow">Do you know Gab Dol became a public official?</font>

605
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:32,924
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

606
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:37,024
<font color="yellow">I've raised my kids all by myself for over 20 years.</font>

607
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:41,024
<font color="yellow">Those who raised their kids as a couple wouldn't understand me.</font>

608
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:43,764
<font color="yellow">I hope my son never has any business with your family.</font>

609
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:46,924
<font color="yellow">I know they broke up but just to make sure.</font>

610
00:42:48,294 --> 00:42:52,064

612
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:56,094
<font color="yellow">today at the house.</font>

614
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:01,264

615
00:43:01,264 --> 00:43:03,164
<font color="yellow">I'd give my blessing.</font>

616
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:05,964
<font color="yellow">But I can't let this happen. Wouldn't you agree?</font>

617
00:43:07,194 --> 00:43:10,494
<font color="yellow">I'll think that you'll do me a favour. I'll be going now.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Are you here for a delivery? - Yes.</font>

620
00:43:31,794 --> 00:43:34,294
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, you know Gab Soon is cleaning these days, right?</font>

621
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:36,894
<font color="yellow">The guys are all talking bad about you.</font>

622
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:39,124
<font color="yellow">We thought you'd get married as soon as you pass the exam,</font>

623
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:40,694
<font color="yellow">but you're making her go through a hard time.</font>

624
00:43:41,234 --> 00:43:42,264
<font color="yellow">Be good to her.</font>

625
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:44,994

627
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:57,894
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

628
00:44:00,024 --> 00:44:02,524
<font color="yellow">Did you know Gab Soon is cleaning?</font>

629
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:04,124
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

630
00:44:04,294 --> 00:44:06,494
<font color="yellow">She came to clean the house I work for.</font>

631
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:08,924
<font color="yellow">You didn't know, did you?</font>

632
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:11,364
<font color="yellow">Don't even say hello to her.</font>

633
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:14,464
<font color="yellow">I'm scared she'll latch on now that you're a public official.</font>

634
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:17,524
<font color="yellow">What is she thinking?</font>

635
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:19,964
<font color="yellow">How can her parents let her live like that?</font>

636
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:21,994
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for her.</font>

637

<font color="yellow">Gab Dol!</font>

638
00:44:42,964 --> 00:44:44,264
<font color="yellow">Must you do this?</font>

639
00:44:45,324 --> 00:44:46,594
<font color="yellow">I get you want to start a business.</font>

640
00:44:47,124 --> 00:44:49,424
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be cleaning? You can do something else.</font>

641
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,624
<font color="yellow">What else? Something splendid?</font>

642
00:44:52,894 --> 00:44:55,464
<font color="yellow">Should I open a franchise? Will you pay for that?</font>

643
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:57,024
<font color="yellow">What will the guys think?</font>

644
00:44:57,424 --> 00:44:58,694
<font color="yellow">They're all blaming me.</font>

645

646
00:45:03,664 --> 00:45:05,324
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for that.</font>

647
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,464
<font color="yellow">Don't be sarcastic.</font>

648
00:45:07,264 --> 00:45:08,664
<font color="yellow">Think if you were me.</font>

649
00:45:09,764 --> 00:45:11,794
<font color="yellow">I heard you ran into my mum today.</font>

650
00:45:13,064 --> 00:45:15,324
<font color="yellow">If you want to marry me, you should make an effort.</font>

651
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:17,924
<font color="yellow">She might not let us even if you become a teacher.</font>

652
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,464
<font color="yellow">Do you need to start on the wrong foot like this?</font>

653
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:22,494
<font color="yellow">Would it seem normal for the elderly?</font>

654
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:24,494
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I feel?</font>

655
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,524
<font color="yellow">How could you not be understanding?</font>

656
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:31,064
<font color="yellow">I advised you to study because I want to marry you.</font>

657
00:45:33,494 --> 00:45:34,994
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get married or not?</font>

658
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:41,994
<font color="yellow">You only think of yourself.</font>

659
00:45:42,564 --> 00:45:45,624
<font color="yellow">Do I need to satisfy your mum about my livelihood?</font>

660
00:45:46,164 --> 00:45:48,724
<font color="yellow">I let my parents down when I started this.</font>

661
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:50,794
<font color="yellow">Nobody lives my life.</font>

662
00:45:51,394 --> 00:45:53,124
<font color="yellow">You?</font>

663
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:55,364
<font color="yellow">You want me to think myself in your shoes?</font>

664
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,394
<font color="yellow">Have you thought of my situation?</font>

665
00:45:58,124 --> 00:46:01,464
<font color="yellow">That's how people are. We can never think ourselves in another's shoes.</font>

666
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:23,564
<font color="yellow">Was that a marriage proposal?</font>

667
00:46:26,064 --> 00:46:28,664
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I won't marry you.</font>

668
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:39,494
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

669
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:45,864
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - I don't want to see you like this.</font>

670
00:46:46,424 --> 00:46:48,364
<font color="yellow">Tell me what happened between you and Geum Sik.</font>

671
00:46:49,024 --> 00:46:52,624
<font color="yellow">She must have come because she knew something.</font>

672
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:53,864
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

673
00:46:53,864 --> 00:46:55,764
<font color="yellow">I went to see Geum Sik but he was away.</font>

674
00:46:55,864 --> 00:46:58,464
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that for? I said I'd think about it.</font>

675
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:04,994
<font color="yellow">I couldn't just watch so I went.</font>

676
00:47:05,224 --> 00:47:07,364
<font color="yellow">You packed up and came back home.</font>

677
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:09,794
<font color="yellow">You have to tell me what's going on.</font>

678
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:11,664
<font color="yellow">Don't make things worse than it is.</font>

679
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:13,764
<font color="yellow">Nothing ever works out when you get in the way.</font>

680
00:47:13,924 --> 00:47:15,194
<font color="yellow">What did you just way?</font>

681
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:19,494
<font color="yellow">I never told you to do dishes.</font>

682
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:21,894
<font color="yellow">Who told you to vacuum?</font>

683
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:24,994
<font color="yellow">Do you think I want to do dishes and vacuum?</font>

684
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:28,724
<font color="yellow">I'm doing it so that I can forget about everything.</font>

685
00:47:29,924 --> 00:47:32,894
<font color="yellow">Don't nag me. This is what you did last time, too.</font>

686
00:47:33,494 --> 00:47:36,264
<font color="yellow">If you left me alone, I would have taken my time.</font>

687
00:47:36,264 --> 00:47:37,424
<font color="yellow">That goes for both the divorce and the remarriage.</font>

688
00:47:42,864 --> 00:47:45,064
<font color="yellow">Fine. You can blame me.</font>

689
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:48,924
<font color="yellow">Let's say it's all my fault. Tell me what's wrong now.</font>

690
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:51,764
<font color="yellow">Please, Mum. Leave me alone.</font>

691
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:54,324
<font color="yellow">Don't go around looking for Geum Sik.</font>

692
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:58,494
<font color="yellow">My life is not up to Geum Sik. I'll decide for myself.</font>

693
00:47:58,694 --> 00:48:00,294
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get divorced again?</font>

694
00:48:01,724 --> 00:48:03,124
<font color="yellow">Great job.</font>

695
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:05,824
<font color="yellow">Everything's working out perfectly.</font>

696
00:48:06,264 --> 00:48:08,564
<font color="yellow">You want me to watch my daughter getting divorced twice?</font>

697
00:48:08,564 --> 00:48:10,324
<font color="yellow">You told me to get divorced if I can't stand it.</font>

698
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:11,424
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean it.</font>

699
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:13,864
<font color="yellow">Are you getting divorced so that you can obey me?</font>

700
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:17,694
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm the one who's suffering the most.</font>

701
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:21,194
<font color="yellow">I even registered Ddol Ee on his register to live with him.</font>

702
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:24,494
<font color="yellow">Do you know what it took for me to come here without a penny?</font>

703
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:27,924
<font color="yellow">If I had at least 1,000 dollars, I wouldn't have come here.</font>

704
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:31,624
<font color="yellow">It's been over a year since you got married and you don't have that?</font>

705
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:34,994
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake. You fool!</font>

706
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:38,394
<font color="yellow">You should have saved some up for yourself.</font>

707
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:39,694
<font color="yellow">I am a fool.</font>

708
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,194
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd be okay if I was loyal and frugal.</font>

709
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:46,224
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live like that any more.</font>

710
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,794
<font color="yellow">So leave me alone for a few days.</font>

711
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,924
<font color="yellow">Look at my daughters.</font>

712
00:48:57,864 --> 00:48:59,864
<font color="yellow">Are you happy going around like this?</font>

713
00:49:04,264 --> 00:49:06,524
<font color="yellow">Get out. I don't want to see your face so get out!</font>

714
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:07,864
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

715
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:10,764
<font color="yellow">One of our ancestors must be a ghost who loves to clean.</font>

716
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:12,894
<font color="yellow">Why are you both doing this today?</font>

717
00:49:13,124 --> 00:49:14,664
<font color="yellow">You need to set yourself straight.</font>

718
00:49:15,094 --> 00:49:17,594
<font color="yellow">You know how humiliating that was?</font>

719
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,294
<font color="yellow">I have a bad daughter...</font>

720
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:22,394
<font color="yellow">so I deserve to hear advices from that woman?</font>

721
00:49:23,724 --> 00:49:26,724
<font color="yellow">She was bragging so much about how her son became a public official.</font>

722
00:49:26,724 --> 00:49:28,224
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bear to watch her.</font>

723
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:30,964
<font color="yellow">He wanted to be a public official and you wanted to be a teacher.</font>

724
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:34,394
<font color="yellow">You two started studying at the same time so why can't you make it?</font>

725
00:49:35,694 --> 00:49:36,994
<font color="yellow">You carry this junk around.</font>

726
00:49:38,194 --> 00:49:40,664
<font color="yellow">Do you two want to see me die?</font>

727
00:49:41,664 --> 00:49:42,794
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Mum.</font>

728
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:45,394
<font color="yellow">- That's your ego. - What?</font>

729
00:49:45,624 --> 00:49:47,464
<font color="yellow">I know because I have a kid of my own.</font>

730
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:50,224
<font color="yellow">You can't always make your kids do what you want.</font>

731
00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:53,064
<font color="yellow">Don't judge us because of how we are now.</font>

732
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,294
<font color="yellow">One of my friends failed to get into a college so she was going to die,</font>

733
00:49:56,464 --> 00:49:57,924
<font color="yellow">but she ended up becoming a hair stylist.</font>

734
00:49:58,364 --> 00:50:00,524
<font color="yellow">We used to pity her,</font>

735
00:50:01,024 --> 00:50:03,694
<font color="yellow">but she owns a popular hair salon in Gangnam now.</font>

736
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,794
<font color="yellow">She has over 20 people working for her.</font>

737
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,524
<font color="yellow">That's her and not you.</font>

738
00:50:08,164 --> 00:50:11,194
<font color="yellow">You're this way so your sister takes after you.</font>

739
00:50:11,424 --> 00:50:13,964
<font color="yellow">If your younger sister takes the wrong path in life,</font>

740
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:16,524
<font color="yellow">you're supposed to lead her to the right path. And what do you say?</font>

741
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:20,824
<font color="yellow">If you showed good example, she wouldn't have turned out this way.</font>

742
00:50:20,994 --> 00:50:24,824
<font color="yellow">Don't scold Jae Soon. It's all my doing.</font>

743
00:50:25,964 --> 00:50:26,964
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

744
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:29,364
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for not being a good example.</font>

745
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:31,694
<font color="yellow">This is all I'm capable of.</font>

746
00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:35,824
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon!</font>

747
00:50:46,324 --> 00:50:49,324
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed as the older one of the family.</font>

748
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:53,494
<font color="yellow">You didn't do it on purpose.</font>

749
00:50:54,524 --> 00:50:55,864
<font color="yellow">There are things...</font>

750
00:50:56,824 --> 00:50:58,564
<font color="yellow">that you can't control in life.</font>

751
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,164
<font color="yellow">Even if I try to escape it, I can't...</font>

752
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:05,464
<font color="yellow">and even if I try my best, I can't do anything.</font>

753
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:09,394
<font color="yellow">There are things you just have to struggle...</font>

754
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:11,964
<font color="yellow">and endure.</font>

755
00:51:16,164 --> 00:51:18,064
<font color="yellow">By the way, what were you talking about earlier?</font>

756
00:51:18,924 --> 00:51:21,094
<font color="yellow">Did you bump into Gab Dol's mum at your workplace?</font>

757
00:51:21,764 --> 00:51:22,764
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

758
00:51:23,594 --> 00:51:25,724
<font color="yellow">It must have hurt Mum's pride.</font>

759
00:51:26,894 --> 00:51:28,324
<font color="yellow">I wanted Mum to look proud...</font>

760
00:51:28,624 --> 00:51:31,964
<font color="yellow">in front of Gab Dol's mum.</font>

761
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,964
<font color="yellow">I went cleaning at Se Gye's house.</font>

762
00:51:37,424 --> 00:51:38,664
<font color="yellow">Se Gye's house?</font>

763
00:51:39,824 --> 00:51:41,124
<font color="yellow">You didn't know it was his place?</font>

764
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:45,594
<font color="yellow">I knew it was the same neighbourhood but I've never been to his place.</font>

765
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:48,294
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry for Se Gye.</font>

766
00:51:49,094 --> 00:51:51,124
<font color="yellow">What would his in-laws think about us?</font>

767
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:52,764
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

768
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:56,424
<font color="yellow">What did Gab Dol's mum say to you?</font>

769
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,694
<font color="yellow">I don't even need to ask.</font>

770
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,594
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, can't you stop working as a cleaner?</font>

771
00:52:06,294 --> 00:52:09,464
<font color="yellow">- Jae Soon. - I agree with Mum.</font>

772
00:52:10,764 --> 00:52:13,464
<font color="yellow">I can't stop you if you insist,</font>

773
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:16,024
<font color="yellow">but you know Mum.</font>

774
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:18,694
<font color="yellow">We're her source of pride.</font>

775
00:52:19,464 --> 00:52:23,324
<font color="yellow">It's like I'm standing alone in a windy field.</font>

776
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:41,964
<font color="yellow">It looks like Geum Sik kicked his wife out.</font>

777
00:52:42,364 --> 00:52:43,494
<font color="yellow">She's at her parents' place.</font>

778
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:48,164
<font color="yellow">I went to see Geum Sik today and her mum was there.</font>

779
00:52:48,364 --> 00:52:50,564
<font color="yellow">She must have gotten worried because her daughter came home.</font>

780
00:52:56,094 --> 00:52:58,264
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Why aren't you saying anything?</font>

781
00:53:02,064 --> 00:53:03,194
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

782
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:08,264
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

783
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:11,124
<font color="yellow">I have only two kids...</font>

784
00:53:11,294 --> 00:53:13,494
<font color="yellow">and they are worse than having 12 kids.</font>

785
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:15,494
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

786
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:20,994
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving, Jae Soon.</font>

787
00:53:21,794 --> 00:53:22,864
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

788
00:53:23,564 --> 00:53:24,894
<font color="yellow">I don't think Mum's feeling well.</font>

789
00:53:33,224 --> 00:53:35,394
<font color="yellow">I won't budge, Mum.</font>

790
00:53:35,564 --> 00:53:38,964
<font color="yellow">I've experienced it all. I've already been humiliated.</font>

791
00:53:39,524 --> 00:53:40,664
<font color="yellow">I won't give up.</font>

792
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:43,564
<font color="yellow">Don't get sick. I'm leaving.</font>

793
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:48,724
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this door?</font>

794
00:53:48,864 --> 00:53:50,724
<font color="yellow">That was the wind.</font>

795
00:54:22,264 --> 00:54:24,294
<font color="yellow">I made your favourite soup.</font>

796
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,894
<font color="yellow">It's not that I don't understand you.</font>

797
00:54:30,624 --> 00:54:32,424
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon and I are grown ups.</font>

798
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:35,794
<font color="yellow">We'll take care of ourselves.</font>

799
00:54:38,624 --> 00:54:40,224
<font color="yellow">We talked about it yesterday.</font>

800
00:54:41,294 --> 00:54:43,364
<font color="yellow">We understand you're an older person,</font>

801
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:47,024
<font color="yellow">but we don't want you to worry about us any more.</font>

802
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:51,524
<font color="yellow">Don't be so attached to us. You should live for yourself.</font>

803
00:54:55,624 --> 00:54:57,224
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

804
00:54:58,164 --> 00:54:59,364
<font color="yellow">We have grown up.</font>

805
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:02,124
<font color="yellow">Whether we sink or swim is up to us.</font>

806
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:06,364
<font color="yellow">You can live happily with Dad. Don't be attached to us.</font>

807
00:55:06,794 --> 00:55:07,824
<font color="yellow">Attached?</font>

808
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:12,264
<font color="yellow">I'm attached to you so I must be bothering you.</font>

809
00:55:12,364 --> 00:55:14,724
<font color="yellow">You're saying I should give you some room?</font>

810
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:18,424
<font color="yellow">I've done my job so I should step out of your life?</font>

811
00:55:18,964 --> 00:55:20,324
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

812
00:55:20,924 --> 00:55:21,994
<font color="yellow">Take this away.</font>

813
00:55:22,064 --> 00:55:24,594
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see your face so get out!</font>

814
00:55:33,224 --> 00:55:35,624
<font color="yellow">This is why they say kids are good for nothing.</font>

815
00:55:36,924 --> 00:55:39,524
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be attached to my children and live my life?</font>

816
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:42,624
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant, Mum. I'm sorry.</font>

817
00:55:42,794 --> 00:55:43,894
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare your food again.</font>

818
00:55:43,994 --> 00:55:46,294
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't want to eat your food.</font>

819
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:54,294
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

820
00:55:54,924 --> 00:55:56,894
<font color="yellow">It's me. It's Geum Sik.</font>

821
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:01,664
<font color="yellow">- It's Geum Sik, right? - Don't open the door.</font>

822
00:56:07,124 --> 00:56:08,124
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

823
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:12,164
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your arm? What happened?</font>

824
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,364
<font color="yellow">I got into an accident.</font>

825
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:17,894
<font color="yellow">When? How bad is it?</font>

826
00:56:18,064 --> 00:56:19,364
<font color="yellow">Did you just hurt your arm?</font>

827
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:22,264
<font color="yellow">I broke a few ribs too.</font>

828
00:56:22,264 --> 00:56:23,424
<font color="yellow">They were hairline fractures.</font>

829
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,364
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake.</font>

830
00:56:25,664 --> 00:56:26,894
<font color="yellow">If you have nothing to say, leave.</font>

831
00:56:28,464 --> 00:56:29,524
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

832
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,364
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll explain later.</font>

833
00:56:32,864 --> 00:56:34,324
<font color="yellow">Let me talk with her first.</font>

834
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,024
<font color="yellow">Sure. Come in.</font>

835
00:56:44,964 --> 00:56:46,194
<font color="yellow">Let me start.</font>

836
00:56:47,294 --> 00:56:49,664
<font color="yellow">I'll listen to what you have to say after.</font>

837
00:56:52,424 --> 00:56:55,664
<font color="yellow">That day, Da Hae followed me to my work trip.</font>

838
00:56:56,194 --> 00:56:57,694
<font color="yellow">She didn't want me to adopt Ddol Ee as my son.</font>

839
00:56:58,364 --> 00:56:59,764
<font color="yellow">She was against it from the beginning.</font>

840
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:02,624
<font color="yellow">I didn't think she would follow me there.</font>

841
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:07,794
<font color="yellow">There were other people watching so I couldn't argue with her.</font>

842
00:57:08,364 --> 00:57:10,824
<font color="yellow">And as you know,</font>

843
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:13,724
<font color="yellow">I was getting back for an important contract...</font>

844
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:15,664
<font color="yellow">and she got in the car.</font>

845
00:57:16,464 --> 00:57:17,724
<font color="yellow">I told her to get off,</font>

846
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:21,324
<font color="yellow">but she said she won't unless I told her that I won't be adopting him.</font>

847
00:57:22,164 --> 00:57:24,264
<font color="yellow">She was being persistent so I couldn't kick her out.</font>

848
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:26,164
<font color="yellow">That's when you called.</font>

849
00:57:26,424 --> 00:57:27,724
<font color="yellow">I was going to take the call...</font>

850
00:57:28,794 --> 00:57:30,594
<font color="yellow">and she was trying to stop me.</font>

851
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:32,724
<font color="yellow">That's when I got into the accident.</font>

852
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:37,794
<font color="yellow">My throat is burning.</font>

853
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:40,664
<font color="yellow">I guess I was mistaken.</font>

854
00:57:41,264 --> 00:57:43,424
<font color="yellow">When you ran to the emergency...</font>

855
00:57:43,924 --> 00:57:45,664
<font color="yellow">and saw us lying down side by side,</font>

856
00:57:46,264 --> 00:57:48,064
<font color="yellow">I could only imagine what ran through your head.</font>

857
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,624
<font color="yellow">I would have thought the same.</font>

858
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:51,364
<font color="yellow">I can't forget...</font>

859
00:57:52,724 --> 00:57:53,764
<font color="yellow">what I saw on your face.</font>

860
00:57:54,424 --> 00:57:56,294
<font color="yellow">It was as if your world collapsed.</font>

861
00:57:57,494 --> 00:57:58,494
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

862
00:58:00,324 --> 00:58:01,564
<font color="yellow">I was mistaken,</font>

863
00:58:03,524 --> 00:58:05,124
<font color="yellow">but I don't want to live like this.</font>

864
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:09,194
<font color="yellow">As long as the girls are with you, you can't cut off their mum...</font>

865
00:58:09,264 --> 00:58:10,794
<font color="yellow">and it'll continue being this way.</font>

866
00:58:11,064 --> 00:58:12,724
<font color="yellow">You'll keep letting her do this...</font>

867
00:58:12,794 --> 00:58:14,494
<font color="yellow">and I'll have to cope with it.</font>

868
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:17,964
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to handle me for it.</font>

869
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:24,664
<font color="yellow">Our problem doesn't end here.</font>

870
00:58:25,224 --> 00:58:27,394
<font color="yellow">- We can't solve it. - We can.</font>

871
00:58:28,124 --> 00:58:30,464
<font color="yellow">- It's already over. - What concerns me...</font>

872
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:33,924
<font color="yellow">What concerns me more than this...</font>

873
00:58:35,694 --> 00:58:37,194
<font color="yellow">is that you were in the same car...</font>

874
00:58:38,064 --> 00:58:39,524
<font color="yellow">with your ex-wife.</font>

875
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:44,024
<font color="yellow">You could have told her to get off.</font>

876
00:58:44,664 --> 00:58:46,524
<font color="yellow">It's not that you are not strong enough.</font>

877
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:49,094
<font color="yellow">If you wanted to, you could have dragged her out of the car.</font>

878
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:51,924
<font color="yellow">I was running out of time so I couldn't.</font>

879
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:54,024
<font color="yellow">That's an excuse.</font>

880
00:58:54,594 --> 00:58:56,294
<font color="yellow">You say, "I couldn't do anything,"</font>

881
00:58:56,424 --> 00:58:58,394
<font color="yellow">"I can't do anything about her,"</font>

882
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:01,294
<font color="yellow">and you let her push you around.</font>

883
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:06,924
<font color="yellow">You will let her...</font>

884
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:09,964
<font color="yellow">push you around forever.</font>

885
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:13,524
<font color="yellow">You told her to get off,</font>

886
00:59:14,724 --> 00:59:16,024
<font color="yellow">but you never dragged her out yourself.</font>

887
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:19,224
<font color="yellow">You felt bad about leaving her on the street.</font>

888
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:27,394
<font color="yellow">I can't do this any more.</font>

889
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,224
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

890
00:59:30,764 --> 00:59:32,424
<font color="yellow">I have reached my limit.</font>

891
00:59:34,594 --> 00:59:37,264
<font color="yellow">I thought about it for the past few days while my mum was pestering me.</font>

892
00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:38,794
<font color="yellow">I came to the conclusion...</font>

893
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:42,924
<font color="yellow">that I was very naive.</font>

894
00:59:45,224 --> 00:59:46,764
<font color="yellow">We both have children...</font>

895
00:59:47,624 --> 00:59:50,194
<font color="yellow">so I should have been more prudent.</font>

896
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:55,364
<font color="yellow">It didn't occur to me...</font>

897
00:59:55,964 --> 00:59:57,594
<font color="yellow">that they have their own mum.</font>

898
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,724
<font color="yellow">I didn't realise that...</font>

899
01:00:03,294 --> 01:00:04,494
<font color="yellow">your ex-wife could...</font>

900
01:00:05,494 --> 01:00:07,324
<font color="yellow">do what she wants...</font>

901
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:09,624
<font color="yellow">with my life.</font>

902
01:00:27,864 --> 01:00:29,824
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll get going.</font>

903
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:32,124
<font color="yellow">You must be thirsty. Have some water.</font>

904
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,594
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

905
01:00:44,424 --> 01:00:45,494
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving?</font>

906
01:00:47,194 --> 01:00:50,864
<font color="yellow">You should take her back home. You can't just leave.</font>

907
01:00:51,324 --> 01:00:54,264
<font color="yellow">You should drag her with you if you plan to live with her.</font>

908
01:00:54,394 --> 01:00:56,424
<font color="yellow">You can't leave her here for long.</font>

909
01:00:57,224 --> 01:00:59,664
<font color="yellow">- I'll be back. - When?</font>

910
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:01,124
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

911
01:01:02,694 --> 01:01:04,924
<font color="yellow">Please help her feel better for the next few days.</font>

912
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:08,624
<font color="yellow">She probably doesn't have a penny on her.</font>

913
01:01:09,694 --> 01:01:10,694
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

914
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:14,164
<font color="yellow">How did you know she didn't have money on her?</font>

915
01:01:15,194 --> 01:01:17,494
<font color="yellow">She hates to see her parents hurt.</font>

916
01:01:18,694 --> 01:01:20,294
<font color="yellow">Imagine what it took for her to be here.</font>

917
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:23,364
<font color="yellow">Please take this to cover your living expenses.</font>

918
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:28,594
<font color="yellow">All right. Take care of yourself.</font>

919
01:01:29,094 --> 01:01:32,164
<font color="yellow">Who's taking care of your household? What about the girls?</font>

920
01:01:32,794 --> 01:01:34,864
<font color="yellow">There's probably nobody to cook.</font>

921
01:01:35,794 --> 01:01:37,524
<font color="yellow">I'm ordering deliveries. There's my sister too.</font>

922
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,524
<font color="yellow">I have to do what I can.</font>

923
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:04,024
<font color="yellow">So Geum Sik didn't do anything wrong.</font>

924
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:05,764
<font color="yellow">You're so cruel.</font>

925
01:02:06,464 --> 01:02:09,964
<font color="yellow">He came all the way here and left you money.</font>

926
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:12,094
<font color="yellow">He said he's sorry...</font>

927
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:14,794
<font color="yellow">so you should have followed him back home. Why are you being stubborn?</font>

928
01:02:15,394 --> 01:02:17,864
<font color="yellow">Didn't it occur to you when you got remarried?</font>

929
01:02:18,364 --> 01:02:20,164
<font color="yellow">It's not like his ex-wife died.</font>

930
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:22,464
<font color="yellow">You know she's alive and well.</font>

931
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,994
<font color="yellow">Didn't you think that she'll come back for the girls?</font>

932
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:28,294
<font color="yellow">It's okay as long as Geum Sik is certain.</font>

933
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:30,964
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're educated or rich.</font>

934
01:02:33,024 --> 01:02:34,664
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

935
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,224
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat since yesterday. You need to eat.</font>

936
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:39,924
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you to make me food.</font>

937
01:02:41,064 --> 01:02:42,894
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to rely on a man to feed me any more.</font>

938
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:45,264
<font color="yellow">I knew how embarrassing that was,</font>

939
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:48,124
<font color="yellow">but I felt it even more this time.</font>

940
01:02:48,964 --> 01:02:50,624
<font color="yellow">Women need to be self-sufficient.</font>

941
01:02:51,324 --> 01:02:54,164
<font color="yellow">I rely on my husband to feed myself...</font>

942
01:02:54,664 --> 01:02:56,964
<font color="yellow">so he looks down on me. Even you and my siblings do as well.</font>

943
01:02:57,764 --> 01:03:01,394
<font color="yellow">Even when I'm struggling, you only worry about what people say.</font>

944
01:03:01,594 --> 01:03:02,794
<font color="yellow">It's not for me.</font>

945
01:03:03,264 --> 01:03:05,664
<font color="yellow">I don't care about what people say.</font>

946
01:03:06,294 --> 01:03:08,094
<font color="yellow">It's for you.</font>

947
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:24,824
<font color="yellow">Where would you meet another man like Geum Sik?</font>

948
01:03:25,524 --> 01:03:27,994
<font color="yellow">That's why his ex-wife is clinging on to him.</font>

949
01:03:28,364 --> 01:03:30,064
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let a good man like him leave?</font>

950
01:03:30,694 --> 01:03:34,424
<font color="yellow">What if his ex-wife moves in while you're here?</font>

951
01:03:35,224 --> 01:03:37,164
<font color="yellow">Let her be. I don't care.</font>

952
01:03:37,424 --> 01:03:40,064
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're young or unmarried.</font>

953
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:41,824
<font color="yellow">Nobody's going to take you in.</font>

954
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:43,924
<font color="yellow">I don't need anyone to take me in.</font>

955
01:03:45,194 --> 01:03:48,364
<font color="yellow">Mum, eat. You'll faint.</font>

956
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:52,264
<font color="yellow">How are you going to make money?</font>

957
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:55,624
<font color="yellow">You don't even know what you're putting yourself into.</font>

958
01:03:56,194 --> 01:03:59,864
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my daughters? Both you and the younger one.</font>

959
01:04:00,224 --> 01:04:01,564
<font color="yellow">Is this how I raised you guys?</font>

960
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:05,664
<font color="yellow">Fine. Eat first.</font>

961
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:09,364
<font color="yellow">I don't need to eat!</font>

962
01:04:09,924 --> 01:04:12,164
<font color="yellow">Why are you not listening to me?</font>

963
01:04:13,024 --> 01:04:14,724
<font color="yellow">Do you even know how I feel?</font>
