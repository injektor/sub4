<font color="yellow">I don't care either.</font>

154
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:54,272
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

155
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,172
<font color="yellow">Have you heard anything from Jae Soon yet?</font>

156
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:01,972
<font color="yellow">I don't know where she is. No one has seen her.</font>

157
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:04,642
<font color="yellow">Do you want to post it?</font>

158
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:06,612
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

159
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,112
<font color="yellow">(Missing person)</font>

160
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,242
<font color="yellow">You can begin.</font>

161
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:13,472
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

162
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:17,812
<font color="yellow">Shin Joong Nyeon. A few days ago, I posted...</font>

165
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,312
<font color="yellow">The reason why I'm taking this video is...</font>

166
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:39,472
<font color="yellow">Uncle, let's do it again.</font>

167
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:42,772
<font color="yellow">What should I say?</font>

168
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,712
<font color="yellow">Just say whatever you want.</font>

169
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,772
<font color="yellow">I'm Shin Joong Nyeon. I posted an episode of...</font>

170
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:04,372
<font color="yellow">"How Shin Joong Nyeon Lives" a few days ago.</font>

171
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,812
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say that. Just get to the point.</font>

172
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:10,642
<font color="yellow">This is my daughter.</font>

173
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:13,772
<font color="yellow">She has gone missing.</font>

174
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:25,472
<font color="yellow">She recently disappeared and hasn't come back.</font>

175
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,372
<font color="yellow">Please look closely at her picture,</font>

176
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:32,512
<font color="yellow">and if you see her by any chance,</font>

177
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,372
<font color="yellow">please call me.</font>

178
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:37,942
<font color="yellow">I need your help.</font>

179
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:42,072
<font color="yellow">Please help me find my daughter.</font>

180
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,142
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

181
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,342
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

182
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,872
<font color="yellow">- Is it Jae Soon? - It's...</font>

183
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,342
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

184
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:03,742
<font color="yellow">I was on my way home, and I thought I'd drop by.</font>

185
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:05,012
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you did.</font>

186
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,112
<font color="yellow">I brought some bread and fruits.</font>

187
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:11,812
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have. You're not a guest.</font>

188
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,672
<font color="yellow">Don't bring us anything next time.</font>

189
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:16,372
<font color="yellow">You don't have much money. You should save every penny.</font>

190
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:19,612
<font color="yellow">I'm doing my best to find Jae Soon, but I haven't gotten much news.</font>

191
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,912
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she's fine. Don't worry.</font>

192
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:23,912
<font color="yellow">We don't know what to do,</font>

193
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,642
<font color="yellow">so we're just looking for her on the street. It's frustrating.</font>

194
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:29,872
<font color="yellow">I don't know where we should begin.</font>

195
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:32,272
<font color="yellow">We're only getting strange phone calls.</font>

196
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:33,942
<font color="yellow">Strange phone calls?</font>

197
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,472
<font color="yellow">We're getting some prank calls.</font>

198
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:39,612
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon can hardly sleep at night because of it.</font>

199
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:43,312
<font color="yellow">We wrote his cell phone number on the flyers.</font>

200
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:44,742
<font color="yellow">I will find her no matter what.</font>

201
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:48,072
<font color="yellow">I've been asking around, so I should hear from her soon.</font>

202
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:51,242
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee will start school soon, so she will come back.</font>

203
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:55,472
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

204
00:13:57,472 --> 00:14:00,442
<font color="yellow">Hearing what you said, I feel much better.</font>

205
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,342
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

206
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:08,572
<font color="yellow">I should've known that life isn't all about the money.</font>

207
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:12,442
<font color="yellow">If Jae Soon had married you, none of this would have happened.</font>

208
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:15,172
<font color="yellow">I'm regretting it so much.</font>

209
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:20,542
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon loved you so much.</font>

210
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:25,272
<font color="yellow">I pushed her to marry Se Bang because I wanted her to have...</font>

211
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:27,812
<font color="yellow">a comfortable life. I didn't mean for things to turn out this way.</font>

212
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:31,972
<font color="yellow">It's all water under the bridge.</font>

213
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,542
<font color="yellow">Is your heater working okay?</font>

214
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:36,842
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

215
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:39,912
<font color="yellow">Your heater at the rooftop broke down,</font>

216
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,972
<font color="yellow">so your daughters had to stay here for the night.</font>

217
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:44,542
<font color="yellow">Well... That's...</font>

218
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,312
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for them too.</font>

219
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:53,672
<font color="yellow">If it's too hard, you can let them stay here for a while.</font>

220
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:55,972
<font color="yellow">No. It's okay.</font>

221
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:01,442
<font color="yellow">- A bottle of soju, please. - Okay.</font>

222
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:20,512
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

223
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,012
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

224
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:26,212
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

225
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:28,572
<font color="yellow">Fish market?</font>

226
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:32,012
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

227
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:35,172
<font color="yellow">I will give you a reward for this later.</font>

228
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:41,412
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

229
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,412
<font color="yellow">Someone saw Jae Soon. We found her.</font>

230
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:46,642
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

231
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:51,542
<font color="yellow">Where is she? Where did the person say she was?</font>

232
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,412
<font color="yellow">She should be around here.</font>

233
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:59,172
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon!</font>

234
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:20,612
<font color="yellow">I can't take this any more. This isn't a joke.</font>

235
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:25,042
<font color="yellow">It's terrible to play a prank on someone having such a hard time.</font>

236
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,842
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's not a prank, but he was just mistaken.</font>

237
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:30,172
<font color="yellow">He says the name of the store was "Jae Soon's".</font>

238
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:32,372
<font color="yellow">We'll find her eventually.</font>

239
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,742
<font color="yellow">It's better than receiving no calls at all. It gives us hope.</font>

240
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:40,172
<font color="yellow">No, it doesn't. It just exhausts us.</font>

241
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:45,472
<font color="yellow">You should check before going out to find her.</font>

242
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:48,772
<font color="yellow">I don't have time to do that. I have to go and see it for myself.</font>

243
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,142
<font color="yellow">That's your problem.</font>

244
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:55,712
<font color="yellow">I told you to look into Se Bang's business, but you didn't.</font>

245
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,142
<font color="yellow">You didn't listen to me.</font>

246
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:01,142
<font color="yellow">If you had looked into it, things wouldn't have turned out this way.</font>

247
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,272
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly blaming me?</font>

248
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:06,212
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

249
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:11,742
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

250
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:20,682
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. Please... - I'm sorry.</font>

251
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,512
<font color="yellow">(Missing person)</font>

252
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,512
<font color="yellow">Please look at this.</font>

253
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,012
<font color="yellow">You know the fish stew restaurant, right?</font>

254
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,372
<font color="yellow">- Take this to that place. - Yes, Sir.</font>

255
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:50,512
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

256
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:55,682
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. I'm from the fish store.</font>

257
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:58,212
<font color="yellow">- Yes. Put it down in the kitchen. - Okay.</font>

258
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:03,072
<font color="yellow">They're really fresh. My boss picked only the best ones.</font>

259
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,072
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

260
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:38,642
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

261
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:41,312
<font color="yellow">That's not her.</font>

262
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:46,342
<font color="yellow">My daughter is not 22. She's turning 40 this year.</font>

263
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:53,142
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

264
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:56,042
<font color="yellow">It's not her.</font>

265
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,012
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

266
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,912
<font color="yellow">Thanks, anyways.</font>

267
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,512
<font color="yellow">I'm mad at you for how you treated me.</font>

268
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:14,372
<font color="yellow">When you first saw me, you said I smelled like relief patch.</font>

269
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:15,942
<font color="yellow">I didn't say that.</font>

270
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:19,142
<font color="yellow">I fell in love with you from the first time I saw you.</font>

271
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:24,682
<font color="yellow">- I'm hanging up. - No, I'm sorry. Don't get mad.</font>

272
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:29,872
<font color="yellow">Now, when I smell relief patch on other ladies,</font>

273
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:31,612
<font color="yellow">I think it's you and start following them.</font>

274
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:36,242
<font color="yellow">But you're quite stubborn.</font>

275
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,712
<font color="yellow">I should have known.</font>

276
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:41,312
<font color="yellow">So? Do you not like me for it?</font>

277
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,742
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

278
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,312
<font color="yellow">That's your charm.</font>

279
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:48,472
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm so attracted to you.</font>

280
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,772
<font color="yellow">I don't like women who are easy.</font>

281
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,342
<font color="yellow">I like women who are hard to get.</font>

282
00:19:56,912 --> 00:20:00,512
<font color="yellow">Nobody's ever told me I was hard to get.</font>

283
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:04,442
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you embarrassed? - I am.</font>

284
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,512
<font color="yellow">How long have we been on the phone?</font>

285
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,342
<font color="yellow">It's been over three hours.</font>

286
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:15,972
<font color="yellow">We're going to stay up all night.</font>

287
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:19,112
<font color="yellow">Time flies by when I'm talking to you.</font>

288
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:22,342
<font color="yellow">It only takes an hour...</font>

289
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:23,542
<font color="yellow">to say a few words and laugh a few times.</font>

290
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:28,312
<font color="yellow">You don't have delivery today so let's sleep.</font>

291
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,182
<font color="yellow">Okay. Goodnight.</font>

292
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:32,272
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch.</font>

293
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,682
<font color="yellow">Why do I miss you so much?</font>

294
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,612
<font color="yellow">We can meet.</font>

295
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:42,112
<font color="yellow">Right now? That's a great idea.</font>

296
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:44,342
<font color="yellow">Where should we meet? Should I go pick you up?</font>

297
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:45,772
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to the sea?</font>

298
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,312
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

299
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:50,812
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the sea and watch the sunrise.</font>

300
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:52,412
<font color="yellow">We can eat raw fish.</font>

301
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:56,272
<font color="yellow">It's too far. Let's just go to the Han River.</font>

302
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,812
<font color="yellow">It's the same sun.</font>

303
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,872
<font color="yellow">Should we get rings?</font>

304
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:18,442
<font color="yellow">Rings?</font>

305
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:21,242
<font color="yellow">Young couples get these rings.</font>

306
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,312
<font color="yellow">We can get them too.</font>

307
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,642
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

308
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:02,342
<font color="yellow">I'm at a funeral.</font>

309
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,912
<font color="yellow">I'm at a funeral.</font>

310
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,212
<font color="yellow">Do you like it?</font>

311
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:24,612
<font color="yellow">This is my first time putting on a ring.</font>

312
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,672
<font color="yellow">Me too. I'm happy.</font>

313
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:28,772
<font color="yellow">It feels like you and I are one.</font>

314
00:22:29,242 --> 00:22:31,842
<font color="yellow">What if your daughter finds out?</font>

315
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:33,372
<font color="yellow">That's fine.</font>

316
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:35,272
<font color="yellow">Don't even lie.</font>

317
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:37,842
<font color="yellow">If she finds out, you're going to push me away...</font>

318
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,512
<font color="yellow">and run away.</font>

319
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:40,642
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

320
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:43,912
<font color="yellow">Can you promise that you'll keep it on?</font>

321
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,142
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

322
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:47,542
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep it on all the time.</font>

323
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,972
<font color="yellow">It means I'm yours.</font>

324
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:51,312
<font color="yellow">You're also mine.</font>

325
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:52,912
<font color="yellow">I'm mine.</font>

326
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:56,972
<font color="yellow">Only wear it when we meet.</font>

327
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:59,872
<font color="yellow">Don't make things complicated.</font>

328
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:02,842
<font color="yellow">If your daughter finds out, we're both done for.</font>

329
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:11,312
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

330
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:12,942
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

331
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:14,612
<font color="yellow">It's Sunday. You should stay home.</font>

332
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:16,612
<font color="yellow">I have a few things to take care of at the office.</font>

333
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:19,172
<font color="yellow">- I have some toast. Have some. - I'll eat out.</font>

334
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:28,372
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

335
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:33,972
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be so polite.</font>

336
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,472
<font color="yellow">See you later, Dad.</font>

337
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:37,542
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's wrong with her.</font>

338
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:39,512
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

339
00:23:46,212 --> 00:23:47,472
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

340
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:49,912
<font color="yellow">You should reply back when someone says hi.</font>

341
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,572
<font color="yellow">She's your brother.</font>

342
00:23:51,572 --> 00:23:53,542
<font color="yellow">Don't you understand?</font>

343
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,672
<font color="yellow">You're not a teenager. Why are you being so rude?</font>

344
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,212
<font color="yellow">You know why I'm acting this way.</font>

345
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:00,672
<font color="yellow">Can't you be more understanding of me?</font>

346
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:02,442
<font color="yellow">Understand what?</font>

347
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:06,212
<font color="yellow">He appeared out of nowhere and ruined my life.</font>

348
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,872
<font color="yellow">You kicked out Se Gye because of him.</font>

349
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,412
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

350
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:12,572
<font color="yellow">Se Gye and you weren't for each other.</font>

351
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:15,442
<font color="yellow">He married you with a motive.</font>

352
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:17,272
<font color="yellow">Can't you still forget about him?</font>

353
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:20,212
<font color="yellow">I don't get it. Anyhow,</font>

354
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:23,072
<font color="yellow">make sure you treat your brother nicely.</font>

355
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:25,572
<font color="yellow">I won't change my mind.</font>

356
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:28,942
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

357
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:35,712
<font color="yellow">Il Ho. Ee Ho.</font>

358
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:42,112
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

359
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:43,742
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

360
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:04,912
<font color="yellow">Why did you come? I told you not to.</font>

361
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:06,342
<font color="yellow">I didn't come to see you.</font>

362
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:11,742
<font color="yellow">Il Ho. Ee Ho.</font>

363
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:20,312
<font color="yellow">You're Il Ho, right?</font>

364
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:25,012
<font color="yellow">Bring Ee Ho with you.</font>

365
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:37,912
<font color="yellow">Let's try the strollers.</font>

366
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,712
<font color="yellow">This is Il Ho's.</font>

367
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:50,842
<font color="yellow">This is Ee Ho's.</font>

368
00:25:58,412 --> 00:26:01,412
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let's go for a ride.</font>

369
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,512
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

370
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,242
<font color="yellow">The boys are so happy.</font>

371
00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:26,212
<font color="yellow">You look happier than they do.</font>

372
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:30,372
<font color="yellow">I never did this for them.</font>

373
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:35,042
<font color="yellow">I always had to carry them so they never got to look around.</font>

374
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:39,612
<font color="yellow">Look, Il Ho.</font>

375
00:26:41,712 --> 00:26:43,642
<font color="yellow">Look, Ee Ho.</font>

376
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:45,512
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty.</font>

377
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:55,112
<font color="yellow">It's seafood. We'll cut it up for you.</font>

378
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:56,472
<font color="yellow">It's seafood.</font>

379
00:26:56,472 --> 00:26:59,572
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make soup so don't cut the head or the organs.</font>

380
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:02,512
<font color="yellow">Can you cut this one up?</font>

381
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:05,172
<font color="yellow">Is this fresh from this morning?</font>

382
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:07,942
<font color="yellow">- The colour... - The colour?</font>

383
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:10,812
<font color="yellow">Your husband is very knowledgeable about fish.</font>

384
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:11,912
<font color="yellow">He must be a good housekeeper.</font>

385
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:13,342
<font color="yellow">He is, indeed.</font>

386
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:33,612
<font color="yellow">I've never been to a place like this. Isn't it expensive?</font>

387
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,742
<font color="yellow">Your wage is enough.</font>

388
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:38,072
<font color="yellow">You've been to places like this a lot, right?</font>

389
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:40,142
<font color="yellow">I don't like places like this.</font>

390
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:42,772
<font color="yellow">The boys have a good appetite.</font>

391
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:47,012
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

392
00:27:49,872 --> 00:27:51,742
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. What is it?</font>

393
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:09,312
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

394
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:22,942
<font color="yellow">I'll check it right away when I go to work tomorrow.</font>

395
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:24,612
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

396
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:41,212
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you see something?</font>

397
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:48,312
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

398
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:50,572
<font color="yellow">I'm upset because of Soo Jo.</font>

399
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:53,272
<font color="yellow">I want to marry him off quickly and have a grandchild.</font>

400
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:54,812
<font color="yellow">You feel the same way, don't you?</font>

401
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:59,542
<font color="yellow">Of course. I've been waiting for my grandson since 30 years ago.</font>

402
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,842
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't even have a chance to see a girl.</font>

403
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,412
<font color="yellow">I wonder why he refuses to meet...</font>

404
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:06,442
<font color="yellow">a girl from a nice family.</font>

405
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:16,412
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

406
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,172
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

407
00:29:26,342 --> 00:29:28,642
<font color="yellow">- Where have you been? - To work.</font>

408
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:31,212
<font color="yellow">Be honest with me. You met a girl, didn't you?</font>

409
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:32,512
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

410
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:35,372
<font color="yellow">I saw you in front of a restaurant on my way home.</font>

411
00:29:36,612 --> 00:29:38,242
<font color="yellow">You saw her? What do you think?</font>

412
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,442
<font color="yellow">I saw her briefly, so I'm not sure.</font>

413
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:43,772
<font color="yellow">How could you be so disloyal?</font>

414
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:46,112
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you.</font>

415
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:50,612
<font color="yellow">What kind of a girl is she? Where did you meet her?</font>

416
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:53,512
<font color="yellow">How old is she? There are so many things I'm curious about.</font>

417
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:54,742
<font color="yellow">Ask me one by one.</font>

418
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,072
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you one thing only.</font>

419
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:00,642
<font color="yellow">I met her while working at the warehouse.</font>

420
00:30:00,972 --> 00:30:02,572
<font color="yellow">She now works at the head office at the design room.</font>

421
00:30:02,972 --> 00:30:05,072
<font color="yellow">Is that so? What about her age?</font>

422
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:08,012
<font color="yellow">How many people are there in her family? What's her name?</font>

423
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:11,112
<font color="yellow">- That's all for now. - Come on.</font>

424
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:12,972
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

425
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,542
<font color="yellow">This is a secret.</font>

426
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:17,772
<font color="yellow">Tell Mum that you're seeing someone,</font>

427
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:19,612
<font color="yellow">so she won't ask you to go on blind dates.</font>

428
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,942
<font color="yellow">I'll tell her when the time is right.</font>

429
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:25,272
<font color="yellow">- But until then... - All right.</font>

430
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:30,642
<font color="yellow">Let's do grocery shopping together from now on.</font>

431
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:32,772
<font color="yellow">It's a great way to refresh myself. I liked it a lot.</font>

432
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:36,212
<font color="yellow">It is, right? I must tell you a bit about Soo Jo.</font>

433
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:37,312
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

434
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,972
<font color="yellow">He doesn't want to go on blind dates. Why don't we leave him alone?</font>

435
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,742
<font color="yellow">We better marry him off quickly.</font>

436
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:44,342
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo prefers love over arranged marriage.</font>

437
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:48,972
<font color="yellow">Are there many pretty women at the warehouse?</font>

438
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:50,112
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

439
00:30:51,012 --> 00:30:52,012
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

440
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:19,542
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, we're in trouble.</font>

441
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,112
<font color="yellow">Two ladies didn't come to work today.</font>

442
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,872
<font color="yellow">Why not? We're supposed to clean the building today.</font>

443
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,842
<font color="yellow">I think another team has hired them discreetly.</font>

444
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:29,972
<font color="yellow">They're the best ones. What should we do?</font>

445
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:32,772
<font color="yellow">I told them that the cleaning will be done by today.</font>

446
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:34,212
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

447
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:55,142
<font color="yellow">- What's up, Se Gye? - Are you busy?</font>

448
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,842
<font color="yellow">Mum and Dad can't eat anything.</font>

449
00:32:58,172 --> 00:32:59,812
<font color="yellow">I hope you can come by.</font>

450
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:03,772
<font color="yellow">I'm volunteering for medical service, and I can't go home today.</font>

451
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:05,772
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

452
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:10,672
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa, please take care of the work here. I need to drop by home.</font>

453
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:12,642
<font color="yellow">We have a lot to do.</font>

454
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:20,972
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm here.</font>

455
00:33:22,772 --> 00:33:27,042
<font color="yellow">Going around for several days got me sick.</font>

456
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,442
<font color="yellow">My entire body is sore.</font>

457
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,212
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

458
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:35,342
<font color="yellow">Stop going outside. You won't find Jae Soon that way.</font>

459
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:37,272
<font color="yellow">I'll make some food.</font>

460
00:33:57,272 --> 00:33:58,372
<font color="yellow">My gosh,</font>

461
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:02,472
<font color="yellow">it's been a while since I smelled good food.</font>

462
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:05,212
<font color="yellow">Daughters are better...</font>

463
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:08,112
<font color="yellow">since they make food for their parents.</font>

464
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:11,012
<font color="yellow">You might as well come here and do some housework...</font>

465
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:13,142
<font color="yellow">until your parents recover.</font>

466
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:16,912
<font color="yellow">I work too. You should do this kind of stuff.</font>

467
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,842
<font color="yellow">You can make kimchi stew at least.</font>

468
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,372
<font color="yellow">I came here although I have so much work to do.</font>

469
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:22,442
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

470
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:24,672
<font color="yellow">You're just like a mother-in-law.</font>

471
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:28,142
<font color="yellow">Even your mum gave up on me. Why are you nagging?</font>

472
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:31,512
<font color="yellow">I want you to take care of the house when the family is like this.</font>

473
00:34:31,912 --> 00:34:34,842
<font color="yellow">Does your mother-in-law know?</font>

474
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:36,342
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

475
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:39,742
<font color="yellow">That Jae Soon's marriage was broken off and thus left home.</font>

476
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,942
<font color="yellow">She doesn't. How would she know?</font>

477
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,172
<font color="yellow">Please contact us if you see her.</font>

478
00:34:47,112 --> 00:34:49,342
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, have you seen this woman?</font>

479
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:55,582
<font color="yellow">(Missing person)</font>

480
00:34:56,772 --> 00:34:58,582
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

481
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:01,912
<font color="yellow">Have you seen this woman?</font>

482
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,642
<font color="yellow">You're going through a lot.</font>

483
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:08,972
<font color="yellow">Yes, well...</font>

484
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,872
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for you.</font>

485
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:14,582
<font color="yellow">Your wife must be ill in bed.</font>

486
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:17,172
<font color="yellow">Yes, she is ill in bed.</font>

487
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:20,542
<font color="yellow">You were going to marry her off to a swindler?</font>

488
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:22,772
<font color="yellow">You should've known carefully.</font>

489
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:24,942
<font color="yellow">Didn't you notice?</font>

490
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:27,942
<font color="yellow">You're so smart when it comes to other things.</font>

491
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:32,112
<font color="yellow">What a relief that the marriage didn't work out.</font>

492
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,842
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll find her no matter what.</font>

493
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,872
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best as well.</font>

494
00:35:48,242 --> 00:35:51,142
<font color="yellow">Mum, I cooked rice and kimchi stew,</font>

495
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:52,472
<font color="yellow">so eat later.</font>

496
00:35:52,742 --> 00:35:54,942
<font color="yellow">I came in the middle of work, so I'll get going.</font>

497
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:58,372
<font color="yellow">It must have been hard for you to work and cook all together.</font>

498
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:02,142
<font color="yellow">What is it that you do?</font>

499
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:05,012
<font color="yellow">Excuse me? I just made some food.</font>

500
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:06,742
<font color="yellow">That's not what's important.</font>

501
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:09,582
<font color="yellow">How could you say things about your family?</font>

502
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:14,372
<font color="yellow">I just met your mother-in-law. She knew about everything.</font>

503
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,442
<font color="yellow">- Dear goodness. - I'm sorry.</font>

504
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,942
<font color="yellow">There are things you shouldn't say even if he's your husband.</font>

505
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,242
<font color="yellow">Don't you know Gab Dol well enough?</font>

506
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:26,542
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon doesn't know that her husband is a big mouth.</font>

507
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:30,172
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol is a big mouth,</font>

508
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:31,672
<font color="yellow">and he doesn't make much money.</font>

509
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:34,442
<font color="yellow">There's nothing trustworthy about him.</font>

510
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:38,612
<font color="yellow">If Gab Dol knows, he'd tell his mum right away.</font>

511
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,672
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I didn't get him to keep his mouth shut.</font>

512
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:43,242
<font color="yellow">He slipped it by mistake.</font>

513
00:36:43,342 --> 00:36:45,542
<font color="yellow">There's nothing we can do about the broken marriage,</font>

514
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:49,042
<font color="yellow">but I didn't want her to know about Geum Sik's being a former swindler.</font>

515
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:52,912
<font color="yellow">It may be okay for others, but I didn't want her to know.</font>

516
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,082
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

517
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,842
<font color="yellow">I was so embarrassed that I wanted to hide.</font>

518
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:01,642
<font color="yellow">Speaking bad of your own family will eventually come back to you.</font>

519
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:02,842
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

520
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,542
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

521
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:17,582
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you doing?</font>

522
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:21,582
<font color="yellow">Why? It's Sunday. I can take a break.</font>

523
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,842
<font color="yellow">This room is a mess.</font>

524
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,442
<font color="yellow">Clean up before you rest.</font>

525
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,272
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mum.</font>

526
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:29,342
<font color="yellow">I came here because I didn't want to hear Gab Soon nagging.</font>

527
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,842
<font color="yellow">Go dust off your blanket.</font>

528
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:32,512
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

529
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:38,512
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even whip your wife and got kicked out of your room.</font>

530
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:41,012
<font color="yellow">I wasn't kicked out. I moved out on my own.</font>

531
00:37:41,972 --> 00:37:44,142
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I shouldn't have gotten married.</font>

532
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,942
<font color="yellow">You're newlyweds. Good for you.</font>

533
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:49,472
<font color="yellow">If you got married, you should live happily.</font>

534
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:52,872
<font color="yellow">You're already sleeping in separate bedrooms. It's your fault.</font>

535
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:56,342
<font color="yellow">You've been whipped by her since you were young.</font>

536
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,112
<font color="yellow">Now that she's making money,</font>

537
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:00,342
<font color="yellow">are you even more discouraged?</font>

538
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:01,772
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

539
00:38:01,872 --> 00:38:04,612
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Don't be discouraged.</font>

540
00:38:04,772 --> 00:38:06,772
<font color="yellow">Most women work these days.</font>

541
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:09,942
<font color="yellow">It's not like she makes a lot of money.</font>

542
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:12,712
<font color="yellow">I'm going to let her have it.</font>

543
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:15,042
<font color="yellow">She makes more than I do.</font>

544
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:16,712
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

545
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:20,912
<font color="yellow">She has no respect.</font>

546
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:23,972
<font color="yellow">How can she act so spoiled in front of her mother-in-law?</font>

547
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:26,412
<font color="yellow">How can she not talk or say hello?</font>

548
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:28,842
<font color="yellow">It's because her family isn't doing well these days.</font>

549
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,772
<font color="yellow">Where did you get that ring?</font>

550
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:36,042
<font color="yellow">I found it in the drawers, so I'm wearing it.</font>

551
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:37,642
<font color="yellow">You don't even like them.</font>

552
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:41,082
<font color="yellow">All women like them. If they had one, they'd wear one.</font>

553
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:43,842
<font color="yellow">What do you think I am?</font>

554
00:38:46,812 --> 00:38:48,172
<font color="yellow">Jjajangmyeon is here.</font>

555
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,342
<font color="yellow">Put it there.</font>

556
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,772
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so down? You're a newlywed.</font>

557
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:59,242
<font color="yellow">I guess you must be worried about Gab Dol.</font>

558
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:00,242
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

559
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:02,872
<font color="yellow">I think Young Ran keeps asking him out...</font>

560
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:04,172
<font color="yellow">because of me.</font>

561
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:05,642
<font color="yellow">Do they meet outside?</font>

562
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:07,942
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, I think.</font>

563
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:10,082
<font color="yellow">I think she's asking him about me.</font>

564
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:14,542
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much. I'll take care of it soon.</font>

565
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:18,742
<font color="yellow">Please follow the precautions. Good luck with the restaurant.</font>

566
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:19,912
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

567
00:39:19,912 --> 00:39:21,612
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Bye.</font>

568
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:29,772
<font color="yellow">It's really busy today.</font>

569
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,082
<font color="yellow">Let's check one more place.</font>

570
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:33,142
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

571
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:40,142
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Gab Dol?</font>

572
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:45,442
<font color="yellow">Why is he with a woman this late?</font>

573
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:47,042
<font color="yellow">It's not a woman.</font>

574
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:49,172
<font color="yellow">She's just a co-worker.</font>

575
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:51,672
<font color="yellow">They'll become attached if they hang out too much.</font>

576
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:55,272
<font color="yellow">I hope you hire someone soon.</font>

577
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:56,812
<font color="yellow">I hope so, too.</font>

578
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,842
<font color="yellow">You put up an ad online, so you'll find someone.</font>

579
00:39:59,742 --> 00:40:01,542
<font color="yellow">You must be really stressed these days.</font>

580
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:03,972
<font color="yellow">You should go home and sleep.</font>

581
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:06,872
<font color="yellow">You should go home and rest, too.</font>

582
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,142
<font color="yellow">See you early in the morning.</font>

583
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,272
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

584
00:40:14,642 --> 00:40:15,772
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

585
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:22,342
<font color="yellow">You didn't even say hi when you came in.</font>

586
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:25,442
<font color="yellow">I was just about to. I'm home.</font>

587
00:40:25,442 --> 00:40:26,972
<font color="yellow">I made you say it.</font>

588
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:30,512
<font color="yellow">- When will you use the same room? - Pardon?</font>

589
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,872
<font color="yellow">You're newlyweds. Why do you sleep in separate rooms?</font>

590
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:37,142
<font color="yellow">How can you kick your husband out of your room?</font>

591
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:38,642
<font color="yellow">Whose house is this?</font>

592
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,442
<font color="yellow">I didn't kick him out. He left.</font>

593
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:44,042
<font color="yellow">I nagged at him because he left crumbs all over the place...</font>

594
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,912
<font color="yellow">and kept playing games.</font>

595
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:48,512
<font color="yellow">Men don't like to hear someone nag at them.</font>

596
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,442
<font color="yellow">You should talk to him nicely.</font>

597
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:52,442
<font color="yellow">Who likes to hear someone yelling at them?</font>

598
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:54,272
<font color="yellow">I'm tired too.</font>

599
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,742
<font color="yellow">We both work. Gab Dol should do house chores too.</font>

600
00:40:57,742 --> 00:41:00,142
<font color="yellow">He never cleans the room. He never does the dishes.</font>

601
00:41:00,142 --> 00:41:01,772
<font color="yellow">You're tired because you're making your money.</font>

602
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:04,712
<font color="yellow">You aren't earning money to support me or your husband.</font>

603
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:06,972
<font color="yellow">You weren't like that when you were jobless.</font>

604
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:09,342
<font color="yellow">You're on your high horse because you make money now.</font>

605
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:10,742
<font color="yellow">When was I like that?</font>

606
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:11,872
<font color="yellow">I was never like that.</font>

607
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:14,642
<font color="yellow">You said you couldn't do any chores because you worked.</font>

608
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:16,712
<font color="yellow">That's what you said on the first day you came here.</font>

609
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:18,412
<font color="yellow">That's being on a high horse.</font>

610
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:21,542
<font color="yellow">You make more money, so you look down on your husband.</font>

611
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:23,272
<font color="yellow">Most importantly,</font>

612
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,142
<font color="yellow">I'm your mother-in-law.</font>

613
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:27,912
<font color="yellow">You should at least say hello and goodbye.</font>

614
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:29,642
<font color="yellow">Did your parents teach you to be that way?</font>

615
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:33,242
<font color="yellow">I would've asked your parents to discipline you...</font>

616
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:34,612
<font color="yellow">if they weren't having problems.</font>

617
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,912
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

618
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:38,912
<font color="yellow">I couldn't say hello because I couldn't control my feelings.</font>

619
00:41:39,242 --> 00:41:40,772
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful next time.</font>

620
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,912
<font color="yellow">But Mother,</font>

621
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,342
<font color="yellow">I have to ask you this.</font>

622
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:48,342
<font color="yellow">Did you have to mention it to my dad?</font>

623
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,712
<font color="yellow">- Mention what? - My sister.</font>

624
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:55,612
<font color="yellow">I saw him wandering so I said something because I was worried.</font>

625
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,142
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that?</font>

626
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:59,042
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have said anything.</font>

627
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,812
<font color="yellow">He must've felt...</font>

628
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:03,612
<font color="yellow">really bad after hearing what you said.</font>

629
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:05,542
<font color="yellow">Put yourself in his position.</font>

630
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,972
<font color="yellow">How would you feel if my dad said something like that to you?</font>

631
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:10,642
<font color="yellow">It's not like I said something bad.</font>

632
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:13,742
<font color="yellow">He's like family, so I showed my concern.</font>

633
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:16,442
<font color="yellow">I guess he felt bad because he has an inferiority complex.</font>

634
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,872
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

635
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:20,142
<font color="yellow">My dad doesn't have an inferiority complex.</font>

636
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:21,942
<font color="yellow">Why are you like that?</font>

637
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:23,542
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

638
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,242
<font color="yellow">You should listen quietly to someone who's older than you.</font>

639
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:29,242
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk back?</font>

640
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:31,972
<font color="yellow">You've never once listened to me obediently.</font>

641
00:42:31,972 --> 00:42:33,342
<font color="yellow">Are you looking down on me?</font>

642
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,612
<font color="yellow">Because I have no husband?</font>

643
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:37,242
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

644
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:40,042
<font color="yellow">I just explained the situation.</font>

645
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,672
<font color="yellow">How is that talking back?</font>

646
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:44,912
<font color="yellow">I don't want to say I'm wrong when I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

647
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:46,272
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

648
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,342
<font color="yellow">I should explain myself when you misunderstand me.</font>

649
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:51,442
<font color="yellow">I was never on a high horse for making more money.</font>

650
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:53,272
<font color="yellow">I never kicked Gab Dol out.</font>

651
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:56,742
<font color="yellow">I'll keep my mouth shut forever if you think I'm talking back.</font>

652
00:42:56,912 --> 00:42:59,512
<font color="yellow">But you'll scold me if I don't talk.</font>

653
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:01,042
<font color="yellow">What should I do then?</font>

654
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,512
<font color="yellow">You said we were family.</font>

655
00:43:02,742 --> 00:43:06,272
<font color="yellow">Can't you be considerate of my feelings when I'm down?</font>

656
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:09,642
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol and I both work the same, long hours.</font>

657
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:12,242
<font color="yellow">Would you have treated me like this if I were your daughter?</font>

658
00:43:12,242 --> 00:43:13,972
<font color="yellow">I came home after working all day.</font>

659
00:43:13,972 --> 00:43:17,242
<font color="yellow">Do you have to sit me down and nag at me like this?</font>

660
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:18,612
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

661
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:21,082
<font color="yellow">Look at her.</font>

662
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:22,672
<font color="yellow">You heard what she said, right?</font>

663
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:25,942
<font color="yellow">She never once apologises but she talks back to me.</font>

664
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:29,042
<font color="yellow">Even when I say something wrong,</font>

665
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:31,442
<font color="yellow">you should just nod.</font>

666
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,082
<font color="yellow">Why do you always talk back?</font>

667
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:35,272
<font color="yellow">Do I have to put up with you?</font>

668
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:39,512
<font color="yellow">Do I give you a hard time? Am I a bad mother-in-law?</font>

669
00:43:39,512 --> 00:43:41,242
<font color="yellow">You two sleep in separate rooms.</font>

670
00:43:41,242 --> 00:43:44,072
<font color="yellow">So all I said was "You shouldn't do that."</font>

671
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:46,942
<font color="yellow">When I tell her one thing she talks back for several minutes.</font>

672
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,142
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

673
00:43:56,642 --> 00:43:57,942
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with everything else.</font>

674
00:43:58,642 --> 00:44:00,442
<font color="yellow">You say whatever you like to me.</font>

675
00:44:00,442 --> 00:44:03,512
<font color="yellow">You can swear at me. That's okay.</font>

676
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:05,772
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

677
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:11,942
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to do that to my mum.</font>

678
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,512
<font color="yellow">She had a tough life.</font>

679
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:18,542
<font color="yellow">I'll put up with everything.</font>

680
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:21,342
<font color="yellow">I'll agree with you on anything.</font>

681
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:25,142
<font color="yellow">But I don't want you...</font>

682
00:44:25,742 --> 00:44:27,042
<font color="yellow">to talk back to her.</font>

683
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:30,242
<font color="yellow">If you do this one more time,</font>

684
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:32,242
<font color="yellow">I won't stand it.</font>

685
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:55,442
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Did you sell a lot?</font>

686
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,942
<font color="yellow">Yes, I sold all the mackerels.</font>

687
00:44:57,942 --> 00:45:01,042
<font color="yellow">I told you to put ice in that box.</font>

688
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:02,912
<font color="yellow">They all melted.</font>

689
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:05,872
<font color="yellow">They'll go bad. Do you know how much they cost?</font>

690
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:07,172
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

691
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:09,442
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

692
00:45:22,342 --> 00:45:24,042
<font color="yellow">It smells like pizza.</font>

693
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:25,172
<font color="yellow">It's pizza bread.</font>

694
00:45:25,442 --> 00:45:27,972
<font color="yellow">That looks yummy. Can I have a bite?</font>

695
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:29,542
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

696
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:45,542
<font color="yellow">No! Why did you eat mine?</font>

697
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,042
<font color="yellow">Teacher!</font>

698
00:45:47,342 --> 00:45:49,912
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

699
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:52,042
<font color="yellow">He ate my bread.</font>

700
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,442
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

701
00:45:54,442 --> 00:45:56,972
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't eat other people's food without permission.</font>

702
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:58,812
<font color="yellow">I wanted to have some.</font>

703
00:45:59,642 --> 00:46:02,542
<font color="yellow">My son is in the first grade.</font>

704
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:06,242
<font color="yellow">Which one is the best college savings plan?</font>

705
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:07,772
<font color="yellow">Have you seen this person?</font>

706
00:46:07,772 --> 00:46:09,242
<font color="yellow">Please take a look.</font>

707
00:46:10,842 --> 00:46:13,412
<font color="yellow">Here. Please help.</font>

708
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:16,712
<font color="yellow">Please give me a call if you see this person.</font>

709
00:46:16,712 --> 00:46:18,812
<font color="yellow">- I hope you find her soon. - Thank you.</font>

710
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:22,272
<font color="yellow">Please give me a call if you see this person.</font>

711
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:30,742
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

712
00:46:31,742 --> 00:46:32,842
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

713
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:38,642
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon!</font>

714
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:43,242
<font color="yellow">- Jae Soon. - What are you doing?</font>

715
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:45,142
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

716
00:46:45,142 --> 00:46:47,412
<font color="yellow">You look just like my daughter.</font>

717
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:49,142
<font color="yellow">You're crazy.</font>

718
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:50,512
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

719
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:08,842
<font color="yellow">She looked exactly like Jae Soon from behind.</font>

720
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:12,672
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon looks exactly like you from behind.</font>

721
00:47:13,142 --> 00:47:14,242
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

722
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:17,412
<font color="yellow">Be careful. You aren't young any more.</font>

723
00:47:17,812 --> 00:47:19,742
<font color="yellow">If you hurt your knee, it'll take a long time to heal.</font>

724
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,142
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

725
00:47:23,142 --> 00:47:25,042
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I hurt my leg.</font>

726
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:29,642
<font color="yellow">Why is my life so twisted?</font>

727
00:47:29,842 --> 00:47:31,742
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong in my past life?</font>

728
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:35,242
<font color="yellow">Why are my kids giving me so much trouble?</font>

729
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:37,142
<font color="yellow">You're better off not having any children.</font>

730
00:47:44,912 --> 00:47:46,342
<font color="yellow">This is my daughter.</font>

731
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:47,672
<font color="yellow">Have you seen her?</font>

732
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:49,612
<font color="yellow">Please take a closer look.</font>

733
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:51,512
<font color="yellow">(Missing person)</font>

734
00:47:51,942 --> 00:47:54,072
<font color="yellow">I think I've seen her before.</font>

735
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,742
<font color="yellow">Where did you see her?</font>

736
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:56,812
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

737
00:47:56,812 --> 00:47:59,342
<font color="yellow">Please try to remember. Where did you see her?</font>

738
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:01,242
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

739
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:03,572
<font color="yellow">If you end up remembering,</font>

740
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:05,472
<font color="yellow">please call me.</font>

741
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:07,572
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Sure.</font>

742
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:10,312
<font color="yellow">She must have had an affair.</font>

743
00:48:10,342 --> 00:48:11,442
<font color="yellow">It's obvious.</font>

744
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:14,242
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry that her dad has to look for her.</font>

745
00:48:14,412 --> 00:48:16,142
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

746
00:48:16,842 --> 00:48:20,542
<font color="yellow">She didn't have an affair. You can't talk about people like that.</font>

747
00:48:20,642 --> 00:48:22,542
<font color="yellow">We were just talking to each other.</font>

748
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:24,642
<font color="yellow">My daughter is not like that.</font>

749
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:27,342
<font color="yellow">There are other problems so we can't reach her.</font>

750
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:30,212
<font color="yellow">You can't gossip about her like that.</font>

751
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,042
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

752
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:38,242
<font color="yellow">You're so inflexible. No wonder your daughter ran away.</font>

753
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:40,472
<font color="yellow">She probably couldn't take it any more.</font>

754
00:48:40,642 --> 00:48:44,442
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Even if I knew where she was, I wouldn't tell you. Let's go.</font>

755
00:48:44,572 --> 00:48:47,642
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Say that again.</font>

756
00:48:47,742 --> 00:48:49,942
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep following us?</font>

757
00:48:49,942 --> 00:48:51,672
<font color="yellow">She couldn't take it any more?</font>

758
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,642
<font color="yellow">Have you seen her? Have you?</font>

759
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:56,742

778

<font color="yellow">Yes, I drank. So what?</font>

779
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:10,242
<font color="yellow">You think this is good enough?</font>

780
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,342

781
00:50:15,742 --> 00:50:19,442
<font color="yellow">I told you to look into Se Bang.</font>

782
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:22,212
<font color="yellow">You made the final call.</font>

783
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:26,372
<font color="yellow">You stopped me from telling her.</font>

784
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:28,542
<font color="yellow">When she came back after getting divorced,</font>

785
00:50:28,642 --> 00:50:32,642

786
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:34,812
<font color="yellow">That's when it all started.</font>

787
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:38,442
<font color="yellow">You were all excited because Se Bang had some money.</font>

788
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:40,112
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

789
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:44,542
<font color="yellow">You knew he was an ex-convict,</font>

790
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:47,112
<font color="yellow">so why did you still hide it?</font>

791
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:51,442
<font color="yellow">You say I'm materialistic but you're no different.</font>

792
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:54,212
<font color="yellow">- Father. - Am I wrong?</font>

793
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:57,912
<font color="yellow">You have no right to blame me.</font>

794
00:50:58,042 --> 00:51:01,242
<font color="yellow">If you didn't waste your retirement pay,</font>

795
00:51:01,842 --> 00:51:04,442

797

<font color="yellow">Is it about the retirement pay again?</font>

798

799

802
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,412
<font color="yellow">- Tell me what you're going to do. - I don't know. I don't know either.</font>

803
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:22,372
<font color="yellow">How could she do this to her parents?</font>

804
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:24,242
<font color="yellow">Watch when I find her.</font>

805
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:26,742
<font color="yellow">You need to find her first.</font>

806
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:29,672
<font color="yellow">Let's call it quits.</font>

807
00:51:30,412 --> 00:51:34,042
<font color="yellow">Let's get a divorce.</font>

808
00:51:34,172 --> 00:51:37,172
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'm not scared.</font>

809
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:40,042
<font color="yellow">I was planning to do that earlier.</font>

810
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:41,542
<font color="yellow">Let's fill out the documents...</font>

811
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:44,442
<font color="yellow">and sell this house. We can each get a small place.</font>

812
00:51:45,412 --> 00:51:47,542

01:01:35,742 --> 01:01:37,172
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

913
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:40,142
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon wouldn't think about doing something silly.</font>

914
01:01:40,342 --> 01:01:41,772
<font color="yellow">She has Ddol Ee. She'll return.</font>

915
01:01:43,142 --> 01:01:45,242
<font color="yellow">She's right. You should eat.</font>

916
01:01:45,242 --> 01:01:47,812
<font color="yellow">She's a doctor, and she made that for you.</font>

917
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:51,012
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming here when you're busy.</font>

918
01:01:51,072 --> 01:01:52,472
<font color="yellow">Are you really?</font>

919
01:01:53,512 --> 01:01:55,842
<font color="yellow">My gosh. You ruined...</font>

920
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,942
<font color="yellow">all your children's lives because of money.</font>

921
01:02:00,072 --> 01:02:02,772
<font color="yellow">You told Se Gye to break up with such a nice girl like her...</font>

922
01:02:02,772 --> 01:02:04,812
<font color="yellow">because her family is poor.</font>

923
01:02:04,812 --> 01:02:08,912
<font color="yellow">You pushed Jae Soon to marry that swindler because of money too.</font>

924
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:18,442
<font color="yellow">Did you have to say that?</font>

925
01:02:18,442 --> 01:02:19,742
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

926
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:23,472
<font color="yellow">You just don't like to hear it because I'm right.</font>

927
01:02:24,342 --> 01:02:26,742
<font color="yellow">I guess it's the same for everyone.</font>

928
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,172
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

929
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:30,872
<font color="yellow">You've made my brother's life so much harder.</font>

930
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,512
<font color="yellow">You do something terrible, and he takes care of it.</font>

931
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:36,412
<font color="yellow">I said, get out.</font>

932
01:02:36,412 --> 01:02:37,942
<font color="yellow">Look what's happening now.</font>

933
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:40,872
<font color="yellow">You're lying down in your room because you hurt your leg.</font>

934
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:43,912
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon is the only one looking for Jae Soon,</font>

935
01:02:43,912 --> 01:02:46,072
<font color="yellow">shivering out in the cold from the morning. My gosh.</font>

936
01:02:46,672 --> 01:02:49,042
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Poor Joong Nyeon.</font>

937
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:52,072
<font color="yellow">Where would he be wandering around right now?</font>

938
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:57,012
<font color="yellow">This isn't why I've become living proof.</font>

939
01:02:57,012 --> 01:02:58,072
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

940
01:03:12,842 --> 01:03:13,972
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

941
01:03:14,342 --> 01:03:16,012
<font color="yellow">Mother, it's me.</font>

942
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:27,412
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

943
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,612
<font color="yellow">Please be quiet.</font>

944
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:31,342
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

945
01:03:33,012 --> 01:03:34,772
<font color="yellow">She can't see you right now.</font>

946
01:03:34,772 --> 01:03:35,872
<font color="yellow">Talk to me.</font>

947
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:37,572
<font color="yellow">Why can't she see me?</font>

948
01:03:37,872 --> 01:03:39,712
<font color="yellow">I don't know the details,</font>

949
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:42,042
<font color="yellow">but she's very sick.</font>

950
01:03:42,212 --> 01:03:43,842
<font color="yellow">You're so shameless.</font>

951
01:03:43,842 --> 01:03:45,572
<font color="yellow">You wrecked our marriage.</font>

952
01:03:46,442 --> 01:03:48,472
<font color="yellow">Se Gye and I are not done yet.</font>

953
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:49,542
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

954
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,142
<font color="yellow">Please be polite to me.</font>

955
01:03:51,642 --> 01:03:54,012
<font color="yellow">I've been putting up with it, but I won't any more.</font>

956
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:55,772
<font color="yellow">You disrespected me first.</font>

957
01:03:56,172 --> 01:03:58,342
<font color="yellow">You're the one who seduced Se Gye.</font>

958
01:03:58,342 --> 01:04:00,142
<font color="yellow">You started it in the beginning.</font>

959
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:01,942
<font color="yellow">Se Gye was my boyfriend.</font>

960
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:06,412
<font color="yellow">You have no idea how I felt when I let him go.</font>

961
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:09,912
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything because I knew it wasn't your fault.</font>

962
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,072
<font color="yellow">Even when you were rude to me, I tolerated it.</font>

963
01:04:13,012 --> 01:04:14,912
<font color="yellow">I won't put up with it any more.</font>

964
01:04:16,372 --> 01:04:17,442
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

965
01:04:17,872 --> 01:04:21,212
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to put up with this either. Let's see who wins.</font>

966
01:04:46,212 --> 01:04:49,072
<font color="yellow">The number you dialed is not in service.</font>

967
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:51,712
<font color="yellow">Please check again.</font>

968
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:16,212
<font color="yellow">Finish up for me, okay?</font>

969
01:05:16,672 --> 01:05:17,972
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

970
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:30,742
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

971
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:33,572
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to pick up Ddol Ee today.</font>

972
01:05:33,572 --> 01:05:36,442
<font color="yellow">Please drop him off at home after class.</font>

973
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:44,712
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

974
01:05:44,972 --> 01:05:45,972
<font color="yellow">Ji Yeon.</font>

975
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:50,872
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

976
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:53,612
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

977
01:05:54,942 --> 01:05:58,572
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee. Your mother will be here soon, so wait here.</font>

978
01:05:58,572 --> 01:05:59,842
<font color="yellow">You have to stay here.</font>

979
01:06:26,572 --> 01:06:27,642
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

980
01:06:27,842 --> 01:06:29,712
<font color="yellow">My son is starting elementary school.</font>

981
01:06:29,712 --> 01:06:31,942
<font color="yellow">Please show me a nice and cheap backpack.</font>

982
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:37,942
<font color="yellow">I'll take this.</font>

983
01:07:02,672 --> 01:07:04,242
<font color="yellow">Grandpa!</font>

984
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:25,142
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee!</font>

985
01:07:27,812 --> 01:07:28,872
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee!</font>
