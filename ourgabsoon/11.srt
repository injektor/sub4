<font color="yellow">- Shin Mal Nyeon. - Why?</font>

160
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,586
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

161
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:13,526
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

162
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,756
<font color="yellow">How could you say that to me?</font>

163
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:19,356
<font color="yellow">How could you replay your wife's words to me?</font>

164
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:23,156
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do that. You'll have it coming.</font>

165
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,256
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm living like this.</font>

166
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,586
<font color="yellow">You can't even say a thing to her.</font>

167
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:29,926
<font color="yellow">I do speak my mind.</font>

168
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,126
<font color="yellow">You like these.</font>

169
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,086
<font color="yellow">If you do that again,</font>

170
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:41,656
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell on you.</font>

171
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:43,926
<font color="yellow">If she finds it out,</font>

172
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,186
<font color="yellow">she's going to want a divorce.</font>

173
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:47,256
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

174
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:51,426
<font color="yellow">If you do, you and I will both die.</font>

175
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:53,256
<font color="yellow">So be good to me.</font>

176
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:55,426
<font color="yellow">Take pity on me.</font>

177
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:56,556
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

178
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:58,086
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

179
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:01,886
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

180
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:06,756
<font color="yellow">You're back soon.</font>

181
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,126
<font color="yellow">They're meeting these days?</font>

182
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:17,996
<font color="yellow">That's what I heard.</font>

183
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,626
<font color="yellow">They're sleeping over every week?</font>

184
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:20,856
<font color="yellow">That's what I heard.</font>

185
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,626
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear what she said?</font>

186
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:27,326
<font color="yellow">The kids are sleeping over every week at their mum's.</font>

187
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:28,526
<font color="yellow">Except the husband.</font>

188
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,186
<font color="yellow">He shouldn't.</font>

189
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:31,356
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean.</font>

190
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:32,556
<font color="yellow">Don't make me angry and get out.</font>

191
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,286
<font color="yellow">You too. The both of you.</font>

192
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,856
<font color="yellow">This is all because you were greedy.</font>

193
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,826
<font color="yellow">- Mal Nyeon. - What are you saying?</font>

194
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:42,826
<font color="yellow">You made Jae Soon get a divorce because she was having a tough time.</font>

195
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,686
<font color="yellow">You made Jae Soon marry again because she was having a tough time.</font>

196
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,756
<font color="yellow">You made her have no choice but to listen to you since she was little.</font>

197
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,726
<font color="yellow">There's no daughter like Jae Soon in the whole world.</font>

198
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,456
<font color="yellow">If anything happens to Jae Soon, it's entirely your fault.</font>

199
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,026
<font color="yellow">Don't blame my brother.</font>

200
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,386
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

201
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,826
<font color="yellow">- Why? I'm right. - Get out.</font>

202
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,156
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

203
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:08,286
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

204
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:09,886
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

205
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:27,456
<font color="yellow">I'm busy working tonight. I won't come home.</font>

206
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:48,586
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

207
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:53,486
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing here? - You know why.</font>

208
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,386
<font color="yellow">Kids are watching. Talk later.</font>

209
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,286
<font color="yellow">Later when?</font>

210
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,226
<font color="yellow">You can't keep doing this.</font>

211
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:14,956
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

212
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,156
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm scared.</font>

213
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,086
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong and Da Rong, goodbye.</font>

214
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:39,326
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Mum. - Bye, Mum.</font>

215
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,626
<font color="yellow">See you next week.</font>

216
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:43,056
<font color="yellow">Call me if something happens.</font>

217
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:46,726
<font color="yellow">Who are they?</font>

218
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:48,686
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

219
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:52,656
<font color="yellow">- Are they moneylenders? - Why do you ask?</font>

220
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:53,886
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're going to pay them back for me.</font>

221
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:54,986
<font color="yellow">Why are you living like this?</font>

222
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:57,526
<font color="yellow">Have you still not straightened up?</font>

223
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:01,356
<font color="yellow">- I'm incurable. - What?</font>

224
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:04,926
<font color="yellow">Why are you butting in?</font>

225
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:06,456
<font color="yellow">To put it bluntly,</font>

226
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,056
<font color="yellow">why do you care how I live my life?</font>

227
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,626
<font color="yellow">Aren't you embarrassed in front of the kids?</font>

228
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:13,486
<font color="yellow">Straighten up.</font>

229
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,486
<font color="yellow">How can I be more straightened up?</font>

230
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,086
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

231
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:20,956
<font color="yellow">Though we're nothing to each other, you're still their mother.</font>

232
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,356
<font color="yellow">You should be ashamed.</font>

233
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,226
<font color="yellow">Don't look at me. That's annoying.</font>

234
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:49,186
<font color="yellow">Dad, don't be mean to Mum.</font>

235
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,286
<font color="yellow">I think they're bad people.</font>

236
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,456
<font color="yellow">Dad, tell them off.</font>

237
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,126

<font color="yellow">He's not in.</font>

242

<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

244

00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:38,826
<font color="yellow">Come by now.</font>

250
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,226
<font color="yellow">Did you lose sleep over that?</font>

251
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:44,426
<font color="yellow">How can you smile?</font>

252
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:47,326
<font color="yellow">It's nothing I tell you.</font>

253
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:49,886
<font color="yellow">You must be worried because of the hot sauna owner's daughter.</font>

<font color="yellow">He came in early last night.</font>

258
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,926
<font color="yellow">Isn't he meeting the kids' mum?</font>

259
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:02,226
<font color="yellow">- He isn't. - Are you sure?</font>

260
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:03,686
<font color="yellow">I'm sure.</font>

261
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:06,586
<font color="yellow">They talk sometimes because of the kids.</font>

262
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:08,886
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have any good feelings for her.</font>

263
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,956
<font color="yellow">Who knows?</font>

264
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:13,056

<font color="yellow">I don't even know what he's doing.</font>

267
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,856
<font color="yellow">He did many wrongs.</font>

268
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:22,126
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

269
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,186
<font color="yellow">I'm his lawful wife. We've officially married on paper.</font>

270
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:26,486
<font color="yellow">What are you worried about?</font>

271
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:29,556
<font color="yellow">I thought I could be at ease.</font>

272
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,286
<font color="yellow">Why is she like that all of a sudden?</font>

273
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:34,256
<font color="yellow">The kids want their mum.</font>

274
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:37,226
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

275
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:40,126
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm doing great.</font>

276
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:42,856
<font color="yellow">You should.</font>

277
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,486
<font color="yellow">You were kind-hearted since you were little.</font>

278
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:50,556
<font color="yellow">I don't know why but you make me feel sad.</font>

279
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:54,956
<font color="yellow">I think Gab Soon will manage anything.</font>

280
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:58,586
<font color="yellow">I don't feel at ease when I think of you.</font>

281
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,226
<font color="yellow">I'm worried you won't be treated well.</font>

282
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:04,456
<font color="yellow">I'm treated well.</font>

283
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,026
<font color="yellow">You're destined...</font>

284
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,726
<font color="yellow">to live without trouble, under the care of your husband.</font>

285
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:12,426
<font color="yellow">I am living like that.</font>

286
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,696
<font color="yellow">Add Ddol Ee to the family register...</font>

287
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:16,086
<font color="yellow">before he enters lower school.</font>

288
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,326
<font color="yellow">So your husband can think of him as his son.</font>

289
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,486
<font color="yellow">Dad doesn't want that.</font>

290
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:23,426
<font color="yellow">You don't need to listen to him.</font>

291
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:25,326
<font color="yellow">He's a stubborn man.</font>

292
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:28,256
<font color="yellow">He didn't agree to this marriage, but look how well you live.</font>

293
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,556
<font color="yellow">If he finds out...</font>

294
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:32,656
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of that. Go with it.</font>

295
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:36,086
<font color="yellow">You need to send him to school next year.</font>

296
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,956
<font color="yellow">They will go to the same school. If they have different surnames,</font>

297
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,086
<font color="yellow">they'll be hurt.</font>

298
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:42,926
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee and his daughters.</font>

299
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:45,656
<font color="yellow">Then you won't have to worry about that.</font>

300
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:52,926
<font color="yellow">Both the biological parents need to agree to...</font>

301
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,856
<font color="yellow">the adoption of their biological kid.</font>

302
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:58,486
<font color="yellow">Which means that the kid's father needs to agree.</font>

303
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:01,086
<font color="yellow">Is that necessary?</font>

304
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:02,756
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

305
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:06,126
<font color="yellow">Are there people who don't agree?</font>

306
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,986
<font color="yellow">Of course. You can't do it as you please.</font>

307
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,926
<font color="yellow">He's studying today.</font>

308
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:52,356
<font color="yellow">Wavering, wavering.</font>

309
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,626
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

310
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:55,926
<font color="yellow">Do you have good news?</font>

311
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,986
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting so frivolous?</font>

312
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:01,826
<font color="yellow">Why do you care?</font>

313
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:03,126
<font color="yellow">Excuse me,</font>

314
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:04,656
<font color="yellow">what's wrong with you these days?</font>

315
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:07,056
<font color="yellow">What did she do?</font>

316
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:09,956
<font color="yellow">She keeps talking back to you. She's just a maid.</font>

317
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,886
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

318
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,056
<font color="yellow">The person before you was kicked out for that.</font>

319
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,356
<font color="yellow">My father hates that.</font>

320
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,756
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

321
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,326
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch didn't talk back to me.</font>

322
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:23,526
<font color="yellow">If you let her be like this, she'll get worse.</font>

323
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,926
<font color="yellow">I can't even dare.</font>

324
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:31,756
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

325
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:33,626
<font color="yellow">Is the director in?</font>

326
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,756
<font color="yellow">You can go in.</font>

327
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,226
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

328
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,526
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm Shin Gab Soon.</font>

329
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:04,226
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

330
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,086
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it was your car.</font>

331
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:08,086
<font color="yellow">This isn't much,</font>

332
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,056
<font color="yellow">but I brought something.</font>

333
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:14,356
<font color="yellow">Director, can't you please take back what you said about the café?</font>

334
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,126
<font color="yellow">Everyone's worried.</font>

335
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:18,586
<font color="yellow">I cleaned the place up...</font>

336
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:21,556
<font color="yellow">and made a spot for your own private parking lot.</font>

337
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:24,326
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you please overlook this once?</font>

338
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,126
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

339
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:30,656
<font color="yellow">This song is great.</font>

340
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:32,986
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

341
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:39,826
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

342
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,196
<font color="yellow">I'm Shin Gab Soon.</font>

343
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,426
<font color="yellow">I'm here about your car.</font>

344
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:45,926
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

345
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:48,056
<font color="yellow">You can go.</font>

346
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:49,586
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

347
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,026
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

348
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,226
<font color="yellow">Take it with you.</font>

349
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,226
<font color="yellow">Please take it.</font>

350
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:58,426
<font color="yellow">Listen to me when I tell you once. I don't drink that.</font>

351
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,356
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

352
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,556
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

353
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:10,026
<font color="yellow">Are you free for dinner tonight?</font>

354
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:18,356
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

355
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:19,696
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

356
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:22,956
<font color="yellow">You're not my type,</font>

357
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:24,886
<font color="yellow">but I'll give you time to apologise.</font>

358
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:32,926
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

359
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:34,756
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

360
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,886
<font color="yellow">Dad, my mind's set.</font>

361
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:54,756
<font color="yellow">We'll go to see you soon.</font>

362
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:56,126
<font color="yellow">Take that in mind.</font>

363
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:58,586
<font color="yellow">My family.</font>

364
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,456
<font color="yellow">It must be tiring, Sir.</font>

365
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,326
<font color="yellow">Your family is quite ahead of times.</font>

366
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:03,556
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me.</font>

367
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:04,986
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

368
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:07,056
<font color="yellow">Money.</font>

369
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,926
<font color="yellow">You must be tired. Let's take my car.</font>

370
00:22:10,186 --> 00:22:11,186
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

371
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,456
<font color="yellow">Waiter.</font>

372
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:16,026
<font color="yellow">Get the change ready next time.</font>

373
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:17,686
<font color="yellow">I'll be going.</font>

374
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,256
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

375
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:25,886
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

376
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:46,956
<font color="yellow">It's me, Gab Soon.</font>

377
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:02,326
<font color="yellow">- I'll have the usual. - Okay, Sir.</font>

378
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,126
<font color="yellow">You know what you did, right?</font>

379
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:11,086
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

380
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,486
<font color="yellow">- Do you work at the café? - Yes.</font>

381
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,586
<font color="yellow">- How old are you? - I'm 29.</font>

382
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:18,726
<font color="yellow">You're quite old.</font>

383
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:21,926
<font color="yellow">- I can talk to you casually, right? - Excuse me?</font>

384
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:24,586
<font color="yellow">If you don't like it, I'll get rid of the café.</font>

385
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:27,456
<font color="yellow">No. Please don't get rid of the café.</font>

386
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,756
<font color="yellow">All part-time workers will lose their job.</font>

387
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:35,956
<font color="yellow">You don't have a boyfriend, do you?</font>

388
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:37,126
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

389
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:39,956
<font color="yellow">I recently broke up.</font>

390
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:41,126
<font color="yellow">Was it because of money?</font>

391
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:44,586
<font color="yellow">I guess you can't come to places like this often.</font>

392
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,226
<font color="yellow">It's my first time.</font>

393
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,056
<font color="yellow">Can I take a picture?</font>

394
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:51,486
<font color="yellow">Stop. It's tacky.</font>

395
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:53,126
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

396
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:07,456
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

397
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:09,286
<font color="yellow">Not the front seat.</font>

398
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:24,856
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

399
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:27,456
<font color="yellow">Please drop me off at the nearest subway station.</font>

400
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:29,586
<font color="yellow">(Jamwon Station)</font>

401
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:32,186
<font color="yellow">Get off.</font>

402
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,986
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for forgiving me,</font>

403
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,456
<font color="yellow">and also for the delicious...</font>

404
00:24:36,456 --> 00:24:38,386
<font color="yellow">Just get off. There is a car behind us.</font>

405
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:39,586
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

406
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:23,856
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

407
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:35,026
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep. You seem so distracted.</font>

408
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:37,186
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to study?</font>

409
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:38,986
<font color="yellow">Not today.</font>

410
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:43,356
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

411
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:48,856
<font color="yellow">(Pass)</font>

412
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:11,326
<font color="yellow">- Why are you up? - I'll help you with the delivery.</font>

413
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,656
<font color="yellow">You don't have to. Get some sleep.</font>

414
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:16,456
<font color="yellow">- You stayed up all night studying. - I'm fine.</font>

415
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,286
<font color="yellow">I can use some exercise.</font>

416
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:39,156
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Did you sprain your knee?</font>

417
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:41,656
<font color="yellow">- I think so. - What should we do?</font>

418
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,056
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you little...</font>

419
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,126
<font color="yellow">Are you messing with me?</font>

420
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:54,356
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me to go?</font>

421
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:57,586
<font color="yellow">I will go crazy if I see her face on a day like this.</font>

422
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:58,926
<font color="yellow">You should go this time.</font>

423
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,386
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be with Ms Yeo alone.</font>

424
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,486
<font color="yellow">That's not a problem.</font>

425
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:05,086
<font color="yellow">Change to something neat.</font>

426
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,226
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to clean up this room?</font>

427
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:10,356
<font color="yellow">I'm going to throw away all of these someday.</font>

428
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:11,656
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare.</font>

429
00:27:12,386 --> 00:27:14,486
<font color="yellow">I hate you more and more.</font>

430
00:27:15,826 --> 00:27:17,186
<font color="yellow">You always have.</font>

431
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:29,086
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms Yeo.</font>

432
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:30,956
<font color="yellow">It's you today, Mister.</font>

433
00:27:32,356 --> 00:27:34,856
<font color="yellow">You should call me by my name.</font>

434
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:36,926
<font color="yellow">My wife doesn't feel well today.</font>

435
00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:39,856
<font color="yellow">It's because she stays home all day and never exercises.</font>

436
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:44,286
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin. I heard you told Gong Joo to have a baby.</font>

437
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:45,356
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

438
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:49,186
<font color="yellow">They've been married for a year. I wanted to hear about their plans.</font>

439
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:50,526
<font color="yellow">They have no plans for a baby yet.</font>

440
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:54,675
<font color="yellow">Isn't that something they should decide on their own?</font>

441
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,675
<font color="yellow">My dear Gong Joo is too young to do anything.</font>

442
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,175
<font color="yellow">I should decide it for her.</font>

443
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,175
<font color="yellow">Who will raise the baby?</font>

444
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,745
<font color="yellow">If you can't,</font>

445
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,605
<font color="yellow">we're willing to help them raise the baby.</font>

446
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:06,605
<font color="yellow">I just want them to have one.</font>

447
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:10,245
<font color="yellow">We're looking forward to have a grandchild very much.</font>

448
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:12,745
<font color="yellow">If you'll raise the baby, I'll think about it.</font>

449
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:13,845
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

450
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:18,445
<font color="yellow">It's boring and dull without your wife.</font>

451
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:19,775
<font color="yellow">I'll be going then.</font>

452
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:22,005
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving?</font>

453
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,305
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

454
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:25,675
<font color="yellow">We don't have anything to do.</font>

455
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,745
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Mr Shin.</font>

456
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,005
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

457
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,005
<font color="yellow">Are you a moron?</font>

458
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:38,605
<font color="yellow">You went there to get money. Why didn't you say something?</font>

459
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:41,245
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bring myself to say it.</font>

460
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,005
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I feel now?</font>

461
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,945
<font color="yellow">Do you know how it feels to ask for money to the in-laws now?</font>

462
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,275
<font color="yellow">Go and get it.</font>

463
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:49,975
<font color="yellow">We need money for this month.</font>

464
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:53,875
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon. Lead the way.</font>

465
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:58,075
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

466
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,805
<font color="yellow">You should've told me before.</font>

467
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:01,845
<font color="yellow">You must've been so anxious.</font>

468
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:04,775
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you didn't do it on purpose.</font>

469
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,975
<font color="yellow">Of course not. I just forgot.</font>

470
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,445
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

471
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:10,505
<font color="yellow">You'd never do that on purpose.</font>

472
00:29:10,505 --> 00:29:11,875
<font color="yellow">You just forgot.</font>

473
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,675
<font color="yellow">It's a sign of dementia, you know.</font>

474
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:15,745
<font color="yellow">Dementia?</font>

475
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:17,975
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

476
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,945
<font color="yellow">- She's just joking. - No, I'm not.</font>

477
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,675
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your kindness.</font>

478
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:28,839
<font color="yellow">We wouldn't be doing this if hadn't blown my pension.</font>

479
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,429
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

480
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,305
<font color="yellow">I guess that's fine.</font>

481
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,205
<font color="yellow">Since they're married, don't you think Gong Joo should manage...</font>

482
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:37,145
<font color="yellow">the money Se Gye earns?</font>

483
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:39,675
<font color="yellow">- Of course she should. - No, she shouldn't.</font>

484
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:43,675
<font color="yellow">You're the one who worked hard to make him a doctor.</font>

485
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,145
<font color="yellow">You spent so much money on his education.</font>

486
00:29:46,405 --> 00:29:49,175
<font color="yellow">It's not just any school. He went to a medical school.</font>

487
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:53,675
<font color="yellow">Gosh. It would be even more expensive than this house.</font>

488
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,405
<font color="yellow">Who is getting the benefit now?</font>

489
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:58,745
<font color="yellow">Ms Yeo. Don't you think so?</font>

490
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,845
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I haven't thought about it.</font>

491
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:02,075
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

492
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:05,905
<font color="yellow">What a rude woman.</font>

493
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:09,075
<font color="yellow">Why can't you just keep your mouth shut?</font>

494
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:11,505
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have brought you.</font>

495
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:14,245
<font color="yellow">You can face Nae Shim now thanks to me.</font>

496
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:17,845
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon. I think...</font>

497
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:20,675
<font color="yellow">that woman and I are alike.</font>

498
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:22,545
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

499
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,105
<font color="yellow">I'm not telling you.</font>

500
00:30:26,005 --> 00:30:28,175
<font color="yellow">I cross a bridge...</font>

501
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:30,375
<font color="yellow">in the starlight.</font>

502
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:35,175
<font color="yellow">I pass by a breezy reed field.</font>

503
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:39,505
<font color="yellow">It was always there.</font>

504
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:44,505
<font color="yellow">Your apartment waiting for me.</font>

505
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:47,875
<font color="yellow">Please be quiet. You're making me confused.</font>

506
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:54,205
<font color="yellow">Dad. I got ramyeon.</font>

507
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:56,645
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because we don't own an apartment,</font>

508
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:58,475
<font color="yellow">this is harder to memorise than others.</font>

509
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:02,675
<font color="yellow">What should I make for dinner? It's so hard to decide it every day.</font>

510
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:06,345
<font color="yellow">Please make sausage stew. It's so delicious.</font>

511
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:07,545
<font color="yellow">Sausage stew?</font>

512
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,445
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should.</font>

513
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:16,945
<font color="yellow">She's making sausage stew.</font>

514
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:19,005
<font color="yellow">Should I put the noodles in?</font>

515
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:20,905
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

516
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:22,405
<font color="yellow">Can't you smell it?</font>

517
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:24,575
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

518
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:25,675
<font color="yellow">Let's wait.</font>

519
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:28,405
<font color="yellow">You'll smell the sausage stew soon.</font>

520
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,905
<font color="yellow">I'm starving. Let's just eat ramyeon.</font>

521
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:33,775
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

522
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:39,945
<font color="yellow">Be on standby, and come in when I call you.</font>

523
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:41,475
<font color="yellow">It won't work.</font>

524
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:49,805
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat?</font>

525
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:51,405
<font color="yellow">You're here again.</font>

526
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:54,045
<font color="yellow">I have an upset stomach today.</font>

527
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,075
<font color="yellow">Mum. Shouldn't we raise the toilet fee?</font>

528
00:31:57,475 --> 00:31:58,675
<font color="yellow">He's so shameless.</font>

529
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:01,275
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat today?</font>

530
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:03,245
<font color="yellow">I'm asking because...</font>

531
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:06,775
<font color="yellow">I don't want to bother you when you're eating again.</font>

532
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,945
<font color="yellow">They don't have an appetite.</font>

533
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:10,075
<font color="yellow">They don't have an appetite?</font>

534
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:14,075
<font color="yellow">I don't know what that means.</font>

535
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,675
<font color="yellow">It's my wish to be able to overeat.</font>

536
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,475
<font color="yellow">Did you make the sausage stew?</font>

537
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:20,605
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

538
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:29,975
<font color="yellow">She didn't make the stew.</font>

539
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:32,045
<font color="yellow">Why did she ask me then?</font>

540
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,075
<font color="yellow">She asked me what she should make for dinner.</font>

541
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,075
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. Cook ramyeon. - I already am.</font>

542
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,145
<font color="yellow">Si Nae.</font>

543
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:49,775
<font color="yellow">Si Nae.</font>

544
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:56,245
<font color="yellow">Your grandpa is asleep, right?</font>

545
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:58,475
<font color="yellow">Yes. He was sleeping when I checked.</font>

546
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:01,205
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

547
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:03,905
<font color="yellow">It's more delicious to eat secretly.</font>

548
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:05,605
<font color="yellow">He'd flip out if he knew.</font>

549
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:10,075
<font color="yellow">"Stop eating already."</font>

550
00:33:10,545 --> 00:33:13,005
<font color="yellow">"Look at the fat. What are you going to do with all that?"</font>

551
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:16,075
<font color="yellow">- "Lose the fat." - "Lose the fat."</font>

552
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,745
<font color="yellow">Because of my family,</font>

553
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:25,675
<font color="yellow">I can't even consider doing it.</font>

554
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:29,575
<font color="yellow">Don't make a hasty decision. You might regret it later.</font>

555
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,645
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll regret it.</font>

556
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,275
<font color="yellow">It will just be hard.</font>

557
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,345
<font color="yellow">If it's too hard, why don't you transfer to a different department?</font>

558
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:39,845
<font color="yellow">You're fine if you don't operate.</font>

559
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:45,305
<font color="yellow">Se Gye. That's how people live their lives.</font>

560
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:48,905
<font color="yellow">Not a lot of people have a job that they actually like.</font>

561
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:52,005
<font color="yellow">They just do it to earn a living.</font>

562
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,875
<font color="yellow">You're better off than me.</font>

563
00:33:56,845 --> 00:33:57,845
<font color="yellow">I didn't...</font>

564
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,675
<font color="yellow">even have time to think about it. I only tried to move forward.</font>

565
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:03,075
<font color="yellow">I have to make money...</font>

566
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:05,445
<font color="yellow">to support my family.</font>

567
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:07,805
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous of you.</font>

568
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:13,905
<font color="yellow">Are you upset that I don't understand you?</font>

569
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:16,945
<font color="yellow">Your own wound hurts the most.</font>

570
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:26,845
<font color="yellow">Si Nae.</font>

571
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:28,905
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo.</font>

572
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,375
<font color="yellow">Si Nae.</font>

573
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:47,775
<font color="yellow">Si Nae...</font>

574
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,645
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

575
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:19,405
<font color="yellow">Grandpa!</font>

576
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:21,245
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. Dad!</font>

577
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:22,975
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

578
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:35,175
<font color="yellow">(Ms Yeo)</font>

579
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:43,905
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Hurry home.</font>

580
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:03,975
<font color="yellow">(Emergency Room)</font>

581
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:16,445
<font color="yellow">We should've called the ambulance sooner.</font>

582
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:18,945
<font color="yellow">What if Grandpa dies?</font>

583
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:21,305
<font color="yellow">This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't ordered food.</font>

584
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:23,475
<font color="yellow">Se Gye. How is he?</font>

585
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:25,275
<font color="yellow">He has acute indigestion.</font>

586
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:28,205
<font color="yellow">This wouldn't have happened if you had come home early.</font>

587
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:30,015
<font color="yellow">You're not around when we need you.</font>

588
00:36:39,275 --> 00:36:41,245
<font color="yellow">Good afternoon.</font>

589
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:43,245
<font color="yellow">How could you cook so poorly?</font>

590
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:46,645
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - My dad almost died last night.</font>

591
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:48,515
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

592
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:50,675
<font color="yellow">Grandpa was taken to a hospital in an ambulance.</font>

593
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:53,545
<font color="yellow">He stayed in the emergency room all night and just got home.</font>

594
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,845
<font color="yellow">- So? Did he live? - Of course he did.</font>

595
00:36:56,945 --> 00:37:00,075
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam. Be more careful from now on.</font>

596
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:01,575
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

597
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:07,015
<font color="yellow">What happened? What's wrong?</font>

598
00:37:08,105 --> 00:37:09,105
<font color="yellow">It's acute indigestion.</font>

599
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:11,345
<font color="yellow">You should've eaten slowly.</font>

600
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,175
<font color="yellow">Why do you always inhale your food?</font>

601
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,175
<font color="yellow">You scare me every time you eat your meal.</font>

602
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:20,175
<font color="yellow">You'll say goodbye to this world if you're not careful.</font>

603
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:21,475
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

604
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,975
<font color="yellow">It's not just your look, but your organs get old too.</font>

605
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:28,075
<font color="yellow">No one is going to take your food. Please eat slowly.</font>

606
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,205
<font color="yellow">Chew it well and drink water often.</font>

607
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:31,675
<font color="yellow">Stop nagging.</font>

608
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:34,575
<font color="yellow">They'll blame me if something goes wrong.</font>

609
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:36,245
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

610
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:39,675
<font color="yellow">Is it here? It hurt here, didn't it?</font>

611
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:40,905
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

612
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,905
<font color="yellow">I felt heavy in the chest and had fever.</font>

613
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:46,245
<font color="yellow">My hands and feet were cold, and I felt nauseous...</font>

614
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:47,675
<font color="yellow">and dizzy.</font>

615
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:49,805
<font color="yellow">It's acute indigestion.</font>

616
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,045
<font color="yellow">You should apply acupuncture right here.</font>

617
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:54,745
<font color="yellow">It would hurt.</font>

618
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:57,015
<font color="yellow">Still, you should.</font>

619
00:37:57,105 --> 00:38:00,045
<font color="yellow">You might die otherwise. You have to endure the pain.</font>

620
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:02,305
<font color="yellow">What was your daughter doing?</font>

621
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:03,675
<font color="yellow">She was eating food.</font>

622
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,475
