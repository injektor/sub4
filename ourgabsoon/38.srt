00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,300
<font color="yellow">What brings you here at this hour?</font>

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,870
<font color="yellow">What was that for?</font>

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,400
<font color="yellow">Did it upset you that much when I told you that I paid off your debt?</font>

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,200
<font color="yellow">Even so, how could you use violence to me like this all of a sudden?</font>

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,070
<font color="yellow">If I fight back, I will only be reduced to your level.</font>

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,470
<font color="yellow">I will let it go tonight.</font>

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,900
<font color="yellow">For someone who's been harsh with my son, you have a lot to say.</font>

9
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,030
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - Because of what you did,</font>

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,100
<font color="yellow">my son had to go through psychological treatments.</font>

11
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,600
<font color="yellow">Do you think I raised you so you could live like this?</font>

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,070
<font color="yellow">You make me so ashamed.</font>

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,600
<font color="yellow">I am disappointed in you.</font>

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,600
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd be so foolish.</font>

15
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,270
<font color="yellow">Get out of the house now.</font>

16
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,430
<font color="yellow">They had a ceremony at a fast food restaurant...</font>

17
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,470
<font color="yellow">with tteokbokki and fish cake soup.</font>

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,270
<font color="yellow">I was frustrated at the fact that she didn't listen to us.</font>

19
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,670
<font color="yellow">But I felt bad when I heard about their ceremony.</font>

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,970
<font color="yellow">They invited only a few of their elementary school friends.</font>

21
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,570
<font color="yellow">Women remember their wedding ceremony forever.</font>

22
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,430
<font color="yellow">I know it wasn't a proper wedding, but it's still the same thing.</font>

23
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,530
<font color="yellow">That crazy wench. She's so foolish.</font>

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
<font color="yellow">How can she drive a stake through our hearts like this?</font>

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,270
<font color="yellow">Sooner or later, our relatives and friends will find out.</font>

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,370
<font color="yellow">Let's just let them have a proper wedding ceremony.</font>

27
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,500
<font color="yellow">Hey! What are you saying?</font>

28
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,030
<font color="yellow">Do you think I raised you so you could live like this?</font>

29
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,330
<font color="yellow">You have no idea how hard it was to raise you without a father.</font>

30
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,930
<font color="yellow">How can you betray your own mother just because of a girl?</font>

31
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,770
<font color="yellow">I don't need a son like you. Get out now!</font>

32
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,170
<font color="yellow">He told me to keep it a secret, but I guess I have no choice.</font>

33
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,100
<font color="yellow">Your son, Gab Dol, came to see me.</font>

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,500
<font color="yellow">He did?</font>

35
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,070
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,200
<font color="yellow">Did he ask you for money so he can get a place to stay?</font>

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,070
<font color="yellow">No, it was nothing like that.</font>

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,470
<font color="yellow">How can you be so ignorant of your own child?</font>

39
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,500
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not much better.</font>

40
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,870
<font color="yellow">He brought the marriage registration form which you tore up.</font>

41
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,470
<font color="yellow">He told me to treat you right because you are a respectable lady.</font>

42
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,470
<font color="yellow">He told me to treat you with respect.</font>

43
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,870
<font color="yellow">He sternly warned me.</font>

44
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,830
<font color="yellow">He told me that you're the person he respects the most.</font>

45
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,600
<font color="yellow">You should be proud of him. A son like that would make anyone happy.</font>

46
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,230
<font color="yellow">I envy you.</font>

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,130
<font color="yellow">I would be proud to have a son like him.</font>

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
<font color="yellow">You might feel that he is still immature.</font>

49
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,270
<font color="yellow">But he is a wise person.</font>

50
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,370
<font color="yellow">You should trust a son like him.</font>

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,170
<font color="yellow">If he wants to marry that girl, allow him to do so.</font>

52
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,270
<font color="yellow">He may seem immature to you, but I think he's all grown up.</font>

53
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,740
<font color="yellow">Trust him.</font>

54
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,800
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, wake up.</font>

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,170
<font color="yellow">Why? What's wrong?</font>

56
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,870
<font color="yellow">You said you know where Gab Soon lives, right?</font>

57
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,270
<font color="yellow">Lead the way.</font>

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,030
<font color="yellow">You're going, too?</font>

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,330
<font color="yellow">I'm so annoyed that I can't sit still.</font>

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,970
<font color="yellow">I may be old, but I'm still the head of this household.</font>

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,900
<font color="yellow">How dare the youngest of the family cause so much trouble?</font>

62
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,170
<font color="yellow">Exactly!</font>

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know how many times...</font>

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
<font color="yellow">I had to bring back my daughter trying to live with a guy.</font>

65
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,930
<font color="yellow">It's your second time.</font>

66
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,600
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to have Gab Soon.</font>

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,930
<font color="yellow">Why did you make me give birth to her and cause all this headache?</font>

68
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,200
<font color="yellow">You're the one who didn't know you were pregnant for six months.</font>

69
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,930
<font color="yellow">She's been out of your womb for 30 years. You can't put her back in.</font>

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,200
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Okay.</font>

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,770
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol!</font>

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

73
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,070
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - What are you doing at this hour?</font>

74
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,170
<font color="yellow">- I was washing rice. - Where is it?</font>

75
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,770
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - Where is your honeymoon suite?</font>

76
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,070
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, "honeymoon suite"?</font>

77
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,030
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

78
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,600
<font color="yellow">Please come in.</font>

79
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,030
<font color="yellow">Where is Gab Soon?</font>

80
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,330
<font color="yellow">She went out for her morning cleaning job.</font>

81
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,270
<font color="yellow">I was going to make breakfast and go to work.</font>

82
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,230
<font color="yellow">Why is it so cold in here?</font>

83
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,600
<font color="yellow">The heater broke a few days ago.</font>

84
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,600
<font color="yellow">The water faucet is frozen, too.</font>

85
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,170
<font color="yellow">Let's leave.</font>

86
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,170
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it. - Let's try hard and live well.</font>

87
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,400
<font color="yellow">I promise not to make Gab Soon unhappy.</font>

88
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,570
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol will be fully responsible for everything.</font>

89
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,370
<font color="yellow">We will respect each other and be happy.</font>

90
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,970
<font color="yellow">Rules for a married couple.</font>

91
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,330
<font color="yellow">(Heo Gab Dol, Shin Gab Soon)</font>

92
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,100
<font color="yellow">Do not contact Gab Soon ever again.</font>

93
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,300
<font color="yellow">Don't let her in the house, and don't ever call her.</font>

94
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

95
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,930
<font color="yellow">Just do as I say.</font>

96
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,600
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

97
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,230
<font color="yellow">Treat her as if she's not our child.</font>

98
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,570
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,900
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Sit down.</font>

100
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,970
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

101
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,500
<font color="yellow">- Please do this one favour for me. - What?</font>

102
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,330
<font color="yellow">I understand that you're feeling annoyed and disrespected.</font>

103
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,900
<font color="yellow">I feel the same way.</font>

104
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,530
<font color="yellow">I'm frustrated at the fact that I can't control my own child.</font>

105
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,470
<font color="yellow">It annoys me so much.</font>

106
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,800
<font color="yellow">However, I think we should just let them have their ways.</font>

107
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,070
<font color="yellow">After seeing all that?</font>

108
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,170
<font color="yellow">What else can we do?</font>

109
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,400
<font color="yellow">She is still our child.</font>

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,730
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

111
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,730
<font color="yellow">Regardless of what Gab Dol's mum says, let's let them get married.</font>

112
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,530
<font color="yellow">I can't let them live like that.</font>

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,430
<font color="yellow">Dad, just let them get married. It's better that way.</font>

114
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,770
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying this because I approve of their actions.</font>

115
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,970
<font color="yellow">And I'm not saying this because I'm not angry.</font>

116
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,970
<font color="yellow">I just can't bear to watch them live like that.</font>

117
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,230
<font color="yellow">Letting them get married is the only way I'll be able to live.</font>

118
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,230
<font color="yellow">Where did you all go without me?</font>

119
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,770
<font color="yellow">You saw their house.</font>

120
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,870
<font color="yellow">Their heater doesn't work, and the water faucet is frozen.</font>

121
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,900
<font color="yellow">I am angry at her, but how can we watch her live at a place like that?</font>

122
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,530
<font color="yellow">She's our child no matter what happens.</font>

123
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,570
<font color="yellow">You're so sympathetic.</font>

124
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,030
<font color="yellow">That's why no parent can control his or her child.</font>

125
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,500
<font color="yellow">This is my wish.</font>

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking this for her sake.</font>

127
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,230
<font color="yellow">It's solely for me to be at peace.</font>

128
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,200
<font color="yellow">But Gab Dol's mum is against it.</font>

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
<font color="yellow">Let's just do it with or without her approval.</font>

130
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,200
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol already left home anyway.</font>

131
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,970
<font color="yellow">If she saw them, she would have beaten up Gab Soon.</font>

132
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
<font color="yellow">It's better that she didn't see them live like that.</font>

133
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,470
<font color="yellow">She was so proud when Gab Dol became a public official.</font>

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,900
<font color="yellow">If she saw her son washing rice...</font>

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,800
<font color="yellow">with that cold water at that hour,</font>

136
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,340
<font color="yellow">she would have beaten up Gab Soon.</font>

137
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,200
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Where are we going?</font>

138
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,500
<font color="yellow">We should at least notify her.</font>

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,340
<font color="yellow">The sun hasn't even come up yet.</font>

140
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,300
<font color="yellow">Let's go. They will freeze to death if we wait much longer.</font>

141
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,230
<font color="yellow">Dal Tong, do you know where Gab Dol lives?</font>

142
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,100
<font color="yellow">Aren't we here too early? The sun hasn't even come up.</font>

143
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,070
<font color="yellow">Let's go in. I bet she can't sleep, either.</font>

144
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,200
<font color="yellow">- My goodness! - Oh, my gosh!</font>

145
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,970
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for coming so early.</font>

146
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,470
<font color="yellow">But we felt like this was urgent, so we came running to you.</font>

147
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,670
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

148
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,870
<font color="yellow">It's not even morning yet, and you're both here.</font>

149
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,100
<font color="yellow">Do you know that the two had an agreement ceremony yesterday?</font>

150
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,770
<font color="yellow">Say whatever you need to.</font>

151
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,530
<font color="yellow">Do you know that it wasn't Gab Dol...</font>

152
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,970
<font color="yellow">but Gab Soon who made that happen?</font>

153
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,900
<font color="yellow">If someone's talking to you, you should at least look at them.</font>

154
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,030
<font color="yellow">It's not like I came here because I wanted to.</font>

155
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
<font color="yellow">It's the truth.</font>

156
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,070
<font color="yellow">Since things turned out like this,</font>

157
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,070
<font color="yellow">we were thinking about just letting them get married.</font>

158
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,700
<font color="yellow">- What? - What can we do?</font>

159
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,330
<font color="yellow">They already took action.</font>

160
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,100
<font color="yellow">We as adults need to sort things out.</font>

161
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,430
<font color="yellow">We can't abandon our children, can we?</font>

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,970
<font color="yellow">We were going to ignore them at first.</font>

163
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,430
<font color="yellow">But we went to see how they were living, and it wasn't even funny.</font>

164
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,400
<font color="yellow">He was washing rice in a tiny basement room...</font>

165
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,300
<font color="yellow">with no heater and no running water.</font>

166
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,730
<font color="yellow">What rice? Who was washing it?</font>

167
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,270
<font color="yellow">Gab...</font>

168
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,330
<font color="yellow">Let's just get to the point here.</font>

169
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,900
<font color="yellow">On our side, we agreed to marry them off,</font>

170
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,730
<font color="yellow">even if it's within this week.</font>

171
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,530
<font color="yellow">Agreed with whom? I never approved.</font>

172
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,130
<font color="yellow">We're not here for your approval. We're here to give you prior notice.</font>

173
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,370
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

174
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,600
<font color="yellow">I wondered who Gab Soon took after. She takes after you.</font>

175
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,370
<font color="yellow">Causing trouble and then giving notice.</font>

176
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,030
<font color="yellow">Then we'll do as we please.</font>

177
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,770
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

178
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,770
<font color="yellow">We told you. We're going to let them get married.</font>

179
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,470
<font color="yellow">We'll marry them off within this week.</font>

180
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,470
<font color="yellow">And I'll take care of Gab Dol like he's my own son.</font>

181
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,370
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? He's my son.</font>

182
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,230
<font color="yellow">We'll marry them off our way,</font>

183
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,370
<font color="yellow">and if you still won't see Gab Dol,</font>

184
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,900
<font color="yellow">we're saying that we'll take him in.</font>

185
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,270
<font color="yellow">So are you saying that...</font>

186
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,870
<font color="yellow">you're going to make Gab Dol live with you?</font>

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
<font color="yellow">We've never thought of it that way,</font>

188
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,430
<font color="yellow">but we will if we need to.</font>

189
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,800
<font color="yellow">Then is it okay to fix the date as we please?</font>

190
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,800
<font color="yellow">We're done informing you. We'll be going now.</font>

191
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,470
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,230
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

193
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,830
<font color="yellow">You can't make Gab Dol live with you.</font>

194
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,930
<font color="yellow">Why must he live with his in-laws?</font>

195
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
<font color="yellow">If they need a place to live, they'll have to live with me.</font>

196
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,600
<font color="yellow">With you? I can't let that happen.</font>

197
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you'll do to Gab Soon.</font>

198
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,000
<font color="yellow">As you know, I can't afford to buy a house for them.</font>

199
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,370
<font color="yellow">Are you going to buy a house for them?</font>

200
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,500
<font color="yellow">That's what the groom's side should prepare.</font>

201
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,670
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

202
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,200
<font color="yellow">So do you approve of their marriage?</font>

203
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,770
<font color="yellow">That's what she means.</font>

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,230
<font color="yellow">Then let's talk about the rest later.</font>

205
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,700
<font color="yellow">Let's marry them off first.</font>

206
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,030
<font color="yellow">Okay, Jae Soon.</font>

207
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,670
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Didn't you order jjajangmyeon?</font>

208
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,670
<font color="yellow">- You have it instead. - I don't eat jjajangmyeon.</font>

209
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,830
<font color="yellow">- Would you like jjajangmyeon? - Pardon?</font>

210
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,370
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a 50 cent discount.</font>

211
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,170
<font color="yellow">Does anyone here want jjajangmyeon?</font>

212
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,370
<font color="yellow">Would you like jjajangmyeon?</font>

213
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,570
<font color="yellow">I'll eat it.</font>

214
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,800
<font color="yellow">I was thinking of not ever seeing you two again.</font>

215
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,500
<font color="yellow">You went too far.</font>

216
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,900
<font color="yellow">Is that how you want to live?</font>

217
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,730
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - I apologise.</font>

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,100
<font color="yellow">Teach them a lesson this time.</font>

219
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,870
<font color="yellow">Make sure you teach them what they did wrong.</font>

220
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,600
<font color="yellow">Give them a good scolding.</font>

221
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,370
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, were you happy when you took my precious daughter...</font>

222
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,930
<font color="yellow">into that kind of house?</font>

223
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,530
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

224
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,100
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, are you satisfied to see your parents-in-law...</font>

225
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,970
<font color="yellow">give in to you like this?</font>

226
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,470
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

227
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,470
<font color="yellow">They finally got it now.</font>

228
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,700
<font color="yellow">- Father. - Dad.</font>

229
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,170
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you calling me?</font>

230
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,070
<font color="yellow">Mum and Dad, thank you.</font>

231
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,030
<font color="yellow">Mother and Father, I promise I'll be good to her.</font>

232
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,970
<font color="yellow">I'll move out and rent a house in three years.</font>

233
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,600
<font color="yellow">How cheeky.</font>

234
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,170
<font color="yellow">He calls us Mother and Father instantly.</font>

235
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,730
<font color="yellow">Set a date for your wedding as soon as possible.</font>

236
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,170
<font color="yellow">You're letting us have a wedding?</font>

237
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,600
<font color="yellow">Of course. You guys didn't even have a proper wedding.</font>

238
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,170
<font color="yellow">It's not like you don't have parents.</font>

239
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,700
<font color="yellow">I won't have a wedding until my mother agrees.</font>

240
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,400
<font color="yellow">She gave her approval.</font>

241
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,970
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Really?</font>

242
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,070
<font color="yellow">We went to see her early in the morning to set things straight.</font>

243
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,130
<font color="yellow">We got her approval.</font>

244
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,200
<font color="yellow">Go back to your places.</font>

245
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
<font color="yellow">You should live with your parents until you get married.</font>

246
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,570
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir.</font>

247
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,030
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

248
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,130
<font color="yellow">I heard Ddol Ee had to undergo psychotherapy.</font>

249
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,270
<font color="yellow">- How did you... - You should have told me.</font>

250
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,000
<font color="yellow">How could you make me so ignorant?</font>

251
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,770
<font color="yellow">I lived with him as his dad for a year.</font>

252
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,330
<font color="yellow">How could you make me so shameful?</font>

253
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,570
<font color="yellow">Did you have to make me look like a bad guy?</font>

254
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,930
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know about that.</font>

255
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,370
<font color="yellow">I was only caught up in adopting him.</font>

256
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,700
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

257
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,370
<font color="yellow">Was there no need to tell me since I don't deserve to be his dad?</font>

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,530
<font color="yellow">I couldn't tell you.</font>

259
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,830
<font color="yellow">I didn't know if I would live with you or not.</font>

260
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,530
<font color="yellow">I couldn't tell you that he was ill.</font>

261
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,770
<font color="yellow">I didn't want you to feel burdened as he isn't your child.</font>

262
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,970
<font color="yellow">I couldn't tell you because I thought you wouldn't like it.</font>

263
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,930
<font color="yellow">Since it's my child's problem,</font>

264
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,030
<font color="yellow">I thought I should take care of it on my own.</font>

265
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

266
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,200
<font color="yellow">You must have had a tough time on your own.</font>

267
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,600
<font color="yellow">You're amazing, Jae Soon.</font>

268
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,800
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have been able to do it.</font>

269
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,130
<font color="yellow">If that happened to Cho Rong or Da Rong,</font>

270
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,070
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have been able to hold up like you.</font>

271
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,700
<font color="yellow">I probably would have blamed the other person.</font>

272
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,070
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

273
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,170
<font color="yellow">I guess you couldn't tell me because I didn't give you time.</font>

274
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,770
<font color="yellow">Thinking back, I lacked too much.</font>

275
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,400
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to be a good stepmother for my kids.</font>

276
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,470
<font color="yellow">But I wasn't ready to be a good step dad for Ddol Ee.</font>

277
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,600
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past.</font>

278
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,570
<font color="yellow">He's much better now.</font>

279
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,930
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

280
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,170
<font color="yellow">Let's stop acting like we don't have kids.</font>

281
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,900
<font color="yellow">Let's admit that we each have our burdens.</font>

282
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

283
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,270
<font color="yellow">I'm a pair with Ddol Ee.</font>

284
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,270
<font color="yellow">You're a trio with Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

285
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,070
<font color="yellow">Then if I take you,</font>

286
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,270
<font color="yellow">I can have Ddol Ee as well, right?</font>

287
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,230
<font color="yellow">You buy 1 and get 1 free.</font>

288
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,600
<font color="yellow">This is why they say you can't fool your job.</font>

289
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,700
<font color="yellow">Since I work at the supermarket,</font>

290
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,230
<font color="yellow">I can't help but say those things.</font>

291
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,970
<font color="yellow">But how did you find out about Ddol Ee's psychotherapy?</font>

292
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,600
<font color="yellow">Are you a gangster? How dare you hit him?</font>

293
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,300
<font color="yellow">He must have a big mouth.</font>

294
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,600
<font color="yellow">Did he tell you that I hit him?</font>

295
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,370
<font color="yellow">That's so low of you.</font>

296
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,970
<font color="yellow">It's not for you to say.</font>

297
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,770
<font color="yellow">You all shouldn't be so confident.</font>

298
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,200
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - You know.</font>

299
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,800
<font color="yellow">Fine, I admit I should've taken better care of Ddol Ee.</font>

300
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,540
<font color="yellow">But do you even have the right to say this to me?</font>

301
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,430
<font color="yellow">You never called me after the divorce.</font>

302
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,570
<font color="yellow">You didn't pay child support. You have no right to blame anybody.</font>

303
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,570
<font color="yellow">You even left your debt behind.</font>

304
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,670
<font color="yellow">If other people point their fingers at me...</font>

305
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,400
<font color="yellow">and Ddol Ee blames me, I won't be able to say anything.</font>

306
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,970
<font color="yellow">But you really should have nothing to say to me.</font>

307
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,130
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Ddol Ee from now on.</font>

308
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,330
<font color="yellow">I'll take him.</font>

309
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,600
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Why would you take him?</font>

310
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,870
<font color="yellow">He's my son. I don't need a reason.</font>

311
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,070
<font color="yellow">You said so yourself that you had a hard time. I'll do it from now on.</font>

312
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,700
<font color="yellow">Don't be absurd.</font>

313
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,040
<font color="yellow">He finally became stable. Where will you take him now? Are you insane?</font>

314
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,870
<font color="yellow">I'm the sanest I've ever been.</font>

315
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,830
<font color="yellow">For Ddol Ee, I need to get back to my senses.</font>

316
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee can't live without me.</font>

317
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,900
<font color="yellow">He only followed me around ever since he was young.</font>

318
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,670
<font color="yellow">Then there's only one way left.</font>

319
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,000
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

320
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,430
<font color="yellow">- Mum, what is it? - Se Gye, are you busy?</font>

321
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,070
<font color="yellow">I'm not busy.</font>

322
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,930
<font color="yellow">I'm looking over things at the store.</font>

323
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
<font color="yellow">You should drop by.</font>

324
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,200
<font color="yellow">I felt sad for making you leave like that last time.</font>

325
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,300
<font color="yellow">I told you to eat, but why did you just leave?</font>

326
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,500
<font color="yellow">- I saw you, and that was enough. - Can you come now?</font>

327
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,970
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be there soon.</font>

328
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,930
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

329
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,370
<font color="yellow">Yes. We decided to let them get married.</font>

330
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,500
<font color="yellow">That's great news. You made a wise decision.</font>

331
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,900
<font color="yellow">I went to their house, and it wasn't even funny.</font>

332
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,270
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bare to see them live like that.</font>

333
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,100
<font color="yellow">They love each other.</font>

334
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,500
<font color="yellow">You should live with the person you want to live with.</font>

335
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,730
<font color="yellow">You should have approved earlier.</font>

336
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,730
<font color="yellow">You ended up being stressed for nothing.</font>

337
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,130
<font color="yellow">You're right. I feel much better after giving them my approval.</font>

338
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,730
<font color="yellow">They'll need to figure things out on their own now.</font>

339
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,630
<font color="yellow">I envy them.</font>

340
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,430
<font color="yellow">Why do you envy them?</font>

341
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

342
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,540
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

343
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,370
<font color="yellow">To be honest, you're the one who's lucky.</font>

344
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,000
<font color="yellow">It could be a little tiresome to live with your in-laws,</font>

345
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,400
<font color="yellow">but you got to start off your marriage luxuriously.</font>

346
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,730
<font color="yellow">Since they don't have a son, you'll inherit all their wealth.</font>

347
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,000
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat it before it gets soggy.</font>

348
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,400
<font color="yellow">So while were on that subject,</font>

349
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,070
<font color="yellow">can you get me some money?</font>

350
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,670
<font color="yellow">Money?</font>

351
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,370
<font color="yellow">How much?</font>

352
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,000
<font color="yellow">I need to get a house for them.</font>

353
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,230
<font color="yellow">I can't let Gab Soon live with Gab Dol's mother.</font>

354
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,130
<font color="yellow">How much will a two-bedroom apartment be?</font>

355
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,430
<font color="yellow">Could you prepare that money within this week?</font>

356
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,270
<font color="yellow">Within this week?</font>

357
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,430
<font color="yellow">I just sounded like a creditor.</font>

358
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,570
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you for money as if I lent you some.</font>

359
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,040
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to give it to them for free.</font>

360
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,370
<font color="yellow">I'll tell them to pay you back slowly.</font>

361
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,130
<font color="yellow">Eat some more. Is it not delicious?</font>

362
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,070
<font color="yellow">It is delicious, but I had something before I came here.</font>

363
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,200
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
<font color="yellow">You were here.</font>

365
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,830
<font color="yellow">Why did you call Se Gye over?</font>

366
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,770
<font color="yellow">I called him because I wanted to make him some noodles.</font>

367
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,970
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

368
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,700
<font color="yellow">I know you.</font>

369
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,370
<font color="yellow">You talked about money, didn't you?</font>

370
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,100
<font color="yellow">I did. Why?</font>

371
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,500
<font color="yellow">Since he is well off, he could lend his sister some money.</font>

372
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,200
<font color="yellow">It's not like I asked him to give the money to them for free.</font>

373
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,670
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

374
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,730
<font color="yellow">How can you make him ask his in-laws for money?</font>

375
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,700
<font color="yellow">That's called selling off your son.</font>

376
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,000
<font color="yellow">Please stop doing things like that.</font>

377
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,370
<font color="yellow">They should start off their marriage life with the money they have.</font>

378
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,100
<font color="yellow">I did that because Gab Dol's mother said she would live with them.</font>

379
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,530
<font color="yellow">Who wants to live with their in-laws these days?</font>

380
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,400
<font color="yellow">What a foolish woman.</font>

381
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,230
<font color="yellow">Living with her is way better than living in that basement.</font>

382
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,170
<font color="yellow">Men are pathetic.</font>

383
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,770
<font color="yellow">You guys don't know anything.</font>

384
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,200
<font color="yellow">Ask any woman, and they'll say the same thing.</font>

385
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,200
<font color="yellow">We can't let Gab Soon live with her when we know how she'll treat her.</font>

386
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,670
<font color="yellow">She'll suffer to death.</font>

387
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,700
<font color="yellow">I also think it'll be better for them to live separately.</font>

388
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,300
<font color="yellow">It would be uncomfortable for them to live together.</font>

389
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,970
<font color="yellow">They'll just have to put up with that.</font>

390
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,900
<font color="yellow">They're the ones who don't have money to rent a house.</font>

391
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,930
<font color="yellow">In the past, they said your wife's parents' house...</font>

392
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,330
<font color="yellow">and the restroom should be located as far away as possible.</font>

393
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,000
<font color="yellow">But nowadays, they say it's your husband's parents' house...</font>

394
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,470
<font color="yellow">that should be located far away.</font>

395
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,330
<font color="yellow">Of course. I don't even want her living in the same neighbourhood.</font>

396
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,270
<font color="yellow">What if she takes a walk with her guard down...</font>

397
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,570
<font color="yellow">and bumps into her mother-in-law?</font>

398
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,100
<font color="yellow">Imagine bumping into her while she walks around...</font>

399
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,830
<font color="yellow">with no makeup on. How terrible.</font>

400
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,900
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to get out of her house...</font>

401
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,770
<font color="yellow">without having to worry about bumping into her mother-in-law.</font>

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,370
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to do anything. Gosh. It would be so uncomfortable.</font>

403
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,070
<font color="yellow">If living in the same neighbourhood is this uncomfortable,</font>

404
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,970
<font color="yellow">living in the same house will feel like prison.</font>

405
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,270
<font color="yellow">Are mother-in-laws monsters?</font>

406
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,300
<font color="yellow">You talk about them like hateful enemies.</font>

407
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,100
<font color="yellow">You are no better than other women.</font>

408
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,200
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon, aren't you going to take my side?</font>

409
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,130
<font color="yellow">I can't be on your side today.</font>

410
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,670
<font color="yellow">I'm a woman, too.</font>

411
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,800
<font color="yellow">- You're right. - You're right.</font>

412
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,170
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

413
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,900
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

414
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,200
<font color="yellow">You don't want to live with that wench, do you?</font>

415
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,430
<font color="yellow">You'd rather live separately even if it's a shabby house, right?</font>

416
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,070
<font color="yellow">No. I'm going to live at Gab Dol's.</font>

417
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,470
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

418
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,870
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you anyway.</font>

419
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,600
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about getting me a house. I can use Gab Dol's room.</font>

420
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,370
<font color="yellow">I imagined starting my marriage in his room when I was dating him.</font>

421
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,500
<font color="yellow">How are you going to live with such a small dream?</font>

422
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,900
<font color="yellow">Look at Jae Soon who only dreams big.</font>

423
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,700
<font color="yellow">She married only rich men.</font>

424
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,070
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mal Nyeon.</font>

425
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,200
<font color="yellow">Aren't you scared of that wench?</font>

426
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,270
<font color="yellow">Do you want to live there even when you know how she'll treat you?</font>

427
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
<font color="yellow">It'll be impossible for us to visit you.</font>

428
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,800
<font color="yellow">We've already been there before. There's no need to go again.</font>

429
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,130
<font color="yellow">You can come.</font>

430
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not afraid of my mother-in-law.</font>

431
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,230
<font color="yellow">It's been more than 10 years, so I know how to deal with her.</font>

432
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,070
<font color="yellow">If I know the enemy well, I can always win.</font>

433
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,030
<font color="yellow">And Mum, stop calling her "that wench".</font>

434
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,300
<font color="yellow">Treat her like your in-law.</font>

435
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
<font color="yellow">People will blame you if you keep saying that.</font>

436
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
<font color="yellow">Are you already her family member now?</font>

437
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
<font color="yellow">She was her family ever since 10 years ago.</font>

438
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,270
<font color="yellow">If that's what you've decided to do, go ahead.</font>

439
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,070
<font color="yellow">But instead,</font>

440
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,230
<font color="yellow">don't ever come here and complain.</font>

441
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,130
<font color="yellow">"I shouldn't have lived with her."</font>

442
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,770
<font color="yellow">"I'm going crazy because of her."</font>

443
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,000
<font color="yellow">Don't say stuff like that.</font>

444
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,130
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

445
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,500
<font color="yellow">Blaming your parents is something my daughters are very good at.</font>

446
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,570
<font color="yellow">I made it clear, okay?</font>

447
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,400
<font color="yellow">I'll keep that in mind.</font>

448
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,730
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

449
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,830
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

450
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,300
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

451
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,930
<font color="yellow">Your parents told me that they'd rent a house for you.</font>

452
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,970
<font color="yellow">We don't have enough money for that, and I prefer living with you.</font>

453
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,870
<font color="yellow">- Don't lie to me. - I'm not lying.</font>

454
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,470
<font color="yellow">Living in separately costs a lot, and we won't be able to save up.</font>

455
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,830
<font color="yellow">It's much more beneficial for me to live with you.</font>

456
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,600
<font color="yellow">Did you calculate that already?</font>

457
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,700
<font color="yellow">She finished calculating 10 years ago. She said it's a great deal.</font>

458
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,070
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon is smart.</font>

459
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,030
<font color="yellow">Mother, I have to go to work every day.</font>

460
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,600
<font color="yellow">That means you'll be doing the housework.</font>

461
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,030
<font color="yellow">And I'll gain weight from eating your delicious cooking.</font>

462
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,970
<font color="yellow">I always loved everything you cooked.</font>

463
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,270
<font color="yellow">To be honest, you cook better than my mum.</font>

464
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,630
<font color="yellow">My mum is an awesome cook.</font>

465
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

466
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,870
<font color="yellow">Bye Gab Soon. Congratulations on your wedding.</font>

467
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

468
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,900
<font color="yellow">- Get inside. - I'll see you off.</font>

469
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,270
<font color="yellow">I won't let anyone kidnap my wife.</font>

470
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,730
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam.</font>

471
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,130
<font color="yellow">I didn't try to eavesdrop, but I heard everything in the bathroom.</font>

472
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,100
<font color="yellow">Your daughter-in-law is so smart.</font>

473
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,270
<font color="yellow">It seems like she'll be good to you. She says she'll live with you.</font>

474
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,170
<font color="yellow">She's only willing to live with me so she can use me.</font>

475
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,400
<font color="yellow">Then are you going to be used by her?</font>

476
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,970
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

477
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,770
<font color="yellow">I have my own plans.</font>

478
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,970
<font color="yellow">Men are supposed to provide a house when they get married.</font>

479
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,700
<font color="yellow">But I don't have any money.</font>

480
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,000
<font color="yellow">Me not having any money is one thing.</font>

481
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,070
<font color="yellow">But I also don't like her enough to rent a house.</font>

482
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,900
<font color="yellow">And if they live alone,</font>

483
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,270
<font color="yellow">her family will visit them often and treat Gab Dol like their son.</font>

484
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,070
<font color="yellow">I can't let that happen.</font>

485
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,470
<font color="yellow">I can't let them take my son away from me.</font>

486
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,070
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol is naive, so he's already being controlled by Gab Soon.</font>

487
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,900
<font color="yellow">If I don't protect my own son,</font>

488
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,630
<font color="yellow">she will keep him on a very short leash.</font>

489
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,000
<font color="yellow">That's why I have to live with them.</font>

490
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,630
<font color="yellow">You are so thoughtful.</font>

491
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,400
<font color="yellow">You are really one of a kind.</font>

492
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,800
<font color="yellow">You're very smart.</font>

493
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,230
<font color="yellow">Ever since I was young, people told me that I was smart.</font>

494
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,270
<font color="yellow">I just didn't have the chance to study.</font>

495
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,470
<font color="yellow">But if I did, I would've become an important figure now.</font>

496
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,730
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon thinks she's the smartest one.</font>

497
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,170
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

498
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,470
<font color="yellow">I'm way smarter than her.</font>

499
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,670
<font color="yellow">Bring it on.</font>

500
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,730
<font color="yellow">Let's see who will win.</font>

501
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,200
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Okay.</font>

502
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,870
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo, wait.</font>

503
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,700
<font color="yellow">Don't come looking for me.</font>

504
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,370
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you.</font>

505
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,000
<font color="yellow">Hang on a second, Soo Jo.</font>

506
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,200
<font color="yellow">Please listen to what I have to say.</font>

507
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,000
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to. - Please. I beg you.</font>

508
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,270
<font color="yellow">Could you please be generous just this once?</font>

509
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,300
<font color="yellow">Your mother was...</font>

510
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,030
<font color="yellow">only 18 years old then.</font>

511
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,700
<font color="yellow">She lost her mother when she was so young.</font>

512
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,400
<font color="yellow">She wasn't even talking to me then.</font>

513
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,570
<font color="yellow">I made a lot of mistakes.</font>

514
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,330
<font color="yellow">She didn't mean to abandon you.</font>

515
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,000
<font color="yellow">She said she went to a river to kill both you and herself.</font>

516
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,900
<font color="yellow">But she couldn't do that.</font>

517
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
<font color="yellow">So she left you by the river and tried to kill herself only.</font>

518
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,830
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear anything.</font>

519
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,070
<font color="yellow">It's something I hadn't heard of until now.</font>

520
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,870
<font color="yellow">And I still have no desire to know.</font>

521
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,600
<font color="yellow">You never looked for me. Why are you doing this now?</font>

522
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,800
<font color="yellow">It's because we're related by blood.</font>

523
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,970
<font color="yellow">I'm not a kid any more.</font>

524
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,670
<font color="yellow">Frankly speaking, it's not like I need parents at this age, either.</font>

525
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,100
<font color="yellow">I don't care who my parents are.</font>

526
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,230
<font color="yellow">I've never thought about my biological parents.</font>

527
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,830
<font color="yellow">Having one father is enough for me.</font>

528
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,430
<font color="yellow">My name is Geum Soo Jo, and my father is Geum Do Geum.</font>

529
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,230
<font color="yellow">I get it.</font>

530
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,700
<font color="yellow">Still, I don't want to see you suffering like this.</font>

531
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,670
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

532
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,600
<font color="yellow">There are other people who suffer more than I do.</font>

533
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,970
<font color="yellow">I don't hate nor blame my biological parents.</font>

534
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,170
<font color="yellow">I just can't accept the fact that...</font>

535
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,270
<font color="yellow">the woman who made a false report on me...</font>

536
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,970
<font color="yellow">and took me to the police station...</font>

537
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,170
<font color="yellow">is my mother.</font>

538
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,470
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

539
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,230
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get back together with Jae Soon.</font>

540
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised? Didn't you see that coming?</font>

541
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,400
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do everything I can for Ddol Ee.</font>

542
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,900
<font color="yellow">I understand what you're saying,</font>

543
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,300
<font color="yellow">but I'm not sure if Jae Soon wants the same.</font>

544
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you so quiet?</font>

545
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,100
<font color="yellow">We need to hear what Jae Soon thinks.</font>

546
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,400
<font color="yellow">We don't need to. I'm doing this for our child.</font>

547
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,070
<font color="yellow">I hope no one disapproves. I'll go ahead with it.</font>

548
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,770
<font color="yellow">Come on! Attack him!</font>

549
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,530
<font color="yellow">- Ddol Ee, are you having fun? - Yes, it's fun.</font>

550
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,230
<font color="yellow">Let's do this again next time.</font>

551
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,330
<font color="yellow">I wish dad could come with us, too.</font>

552
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,500
<font color="yellow">We have 2 men and 3 women on each team.</font>

553
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,170
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see which team eats more?</font>

554
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,700
<font color="yellow">They say competing with food is the stupidest thing.</font>

555
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,300
<font color="yellow">We can beat them. Let's eat!</font>

556
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,800
<font color="yellow">- We can do it! - We can do it!</font>

557
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,030
<font color="yellow">Let's start.</font>

558
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,130
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, have some. Hurry up.</font>

559
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,440
<font color="yellow">It's tasty.</font>

560
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,530
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, try this one.</font>

561
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
<font color="yellow">Eat some more.</font>

562
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,940
<font color="yellow">Let's do this more often.</font>

563
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,870
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'd love to.</font>

564
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
<font color="yellow">I hope you both get a good night's sleep.</font>

565
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,570
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

566
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,200
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Goodbye.</font>

567
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,400
<font color="yellow">- Ddol Ee, bye. - Goodbye.</font>

568
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,730
<font color="yellow">Bye, Cho Rong.</font>

569
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,130
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Goodbye.</font>

570
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,300
<font color="yellow">Mum, can I play with dad tomorrow?</font>

571
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,730
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

572
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,470
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

573
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,730
<font color="yellow">So do I take turns to spend time with Mr Jo and Dad?</font>

574
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,500
<font color="yellow">I went sledding and had meat with Mr Jo, Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

575
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,170
<font color="yellow">I'm going to play with dad tomorrow.</font>

576
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,570
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, you're so busy...</font>

577
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,370
<font color="yellow">playing with two dads.</font>

578
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,070
<font color="yellow">You spend one day with Geum Sik and the other day with Se Bang.</font>

579
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sure other kids won't know how fun it is.</font>

580
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,200
<font color="yellow">- Mal Nyeon. - Mal Nyeon.</font>

581
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,030
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon. I need to talk to you.</font>

582
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,600
<font color="yellow">Se Bang told me that he's going to get back together with you.</font>

583
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,100
<font color="yellow">He just notified you?</font>

584
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,870
<font color="yellow">He came earlier in the afternoon and just notified us.</font>

585
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,700
<font color="yellow">He said it's the best way for Ddol Ee.</font>

586
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,470
<font color="yellow">He talks as if he's the only one with an opinion.</font>

587
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,030
<font color="yellow">What can we say when he says he'll do anything for his kid?</font>

588
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,600
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even talk about Ddol Ee's psychotherapy.</font>

589
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,330
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I want you guys to get back together,</font>

590
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,800
<font color="yellow">but I don't know why your dad is so against it.</font>

591
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,330
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

592
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,670
<font color="yellow">A Young, I'm not supposed to work today,</font>

593
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,700
<font color="yellow">but I suddenly had to come to Busan for a business trip.</font>

594
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,400
<font color="yellow">It seems like the meeting will take a while.</font>

595
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,530
<font color="yellow">Could you take care of the children today?</font>

596
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I have a flight soon.</font>

597
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,270
<font color="yellow">It's too late to rearrange the schedule.</font>

598
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,940
<font color="yellow">All right. I get it.</font>

599
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,270
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

600
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,600
<font color="yellow">Make sure the door is locked. Your aunt can't come today, either.</font>

601
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,770
<font color="yellow">So don't open the door for anyone. Keep the door locked.</font>

602
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,440
<font color="yellow">Okay, Dad.</font>

603
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,270
<font color="yellow">Wedding present? What do you want?</font>

604
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,730
<font color="yellow">If I may be honest, I want many things.</font>

605
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,030
<font color="yellow">People send their daughters off because of that.</font>

606
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:52,330
<font color="yellow">They say wealthy families send at least five jewelleries.</font>

607
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,630
<font color="yellow">A diamond, pearl, gold...</font>

608
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,330
<font color="yellow">What were the other ones?</font>

609
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,070
<font color="yellow">Ruby and sapphire?</font>

610
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

611
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,600
<font color="yellow">Five jewelleries including ruby and sapphire.</font>

612
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,570
<font color="yellow">That includes the earrings, necklace, ring and bracelet.</font>

613
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,500
<font color="yellow">I've also heard some stuff, so let me share that with you.</font>

614
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,440
<font color="yellow">Do you know that you need to give us at least three keys?</font>

615
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,530
<font color="yellow">Did you only hear what you wanted to?</font>

616
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,200
<font color="yellow">He should be at least a doctor or a lawyer to deserve three keys.</font>

617
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,630
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm talking about.</font>

618
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,270
<font color="yellow">Not everyone deserves five jewelleries, either.</font>

619
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,170
<font color="yellow">Let's not waste our time talking about useless things.</font>

620
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,370
<font color="yellow">We're not giving you any wedding presents,</font>

621
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,530
<font color="yellow">so don't expect anything from us, either.</font>

622
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,970
<font color="yellow">Sounds good. Let's make it even like that.</font>

623
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,940
<font color="yellow">Her son isn't even that great. How could she ask for three keys?</font>

624
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,630
<font color="yellow">Did she ask us for three keys?</font>

625
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,370
<font color="yellow">I have 3 keys. There's 1 for the drawer, 1 for the main door and...</font>

626
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,000
<font color="yellow">- I only have 2. - Let me give you 1 of my keys.</font>

627
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,000
<font color="yellow">Give her these.</font>

628
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,330
<font color="yellow">What's so special about being a public official?</font>

629
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,530
<font color="yellow">By any chance, did you ask her for five jewelleries?</font>

630
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,900
<font color="yellow">- Did you do that? - I was annoyed. That's why.</font>

631
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,030
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon, why don't you become a professional fortune-teller?</font>

632
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,870
<font color="yellow">Stop guessing everything.</font>

633
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,670
<font color="yellow">So what did you decide to do?</font>

634
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,900
<font color="yellow">We agreed not to give anything to each other.</font>

635
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,070
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

636
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,100
<font color="yellow">But don't you think we should give them a little something...</font>

637
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,700
<font color="yellow">so that they don't complain later?</font>

638
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,170
<font color="yellow">We're not giving them anything.</font>

639
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she won't come in with nothing in her hands.</font>

640
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,130
<font color="yellow">They should give us at least something cheap.</font>

641
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,870
<font color="yellow">It'd be insane to send her over with nothing in her hands.</font>

642
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,830
<font color="yellow">They look nice. Let's get these.</font>

643
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,130
<font color="yellow">I don't mind buying cheaper ones.</font>

644
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,270
<font color="yellow">We'll be wearing these forever, so let's get nice rings.</font>

645
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,900
<font color="yellow">But promise me that this is it.</font>

646
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,830
<font color="yellow">No matter what our parents say, there shouldn't be any presents.</font>

647
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,170
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

648
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,330
<font color="yellow">We'll take these.</font>

649
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,570
<font color="yellow">- Gab Soon. - Yes?</font>

650
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,770
<font color="yellow">As you know, my mum can be a snob sometimes.</font>

651
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,700
<font color="yellow">- So? - Well...</font>

652
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,940
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to get presents?</font>

653
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,100
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

654
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,630
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to get them.</font>

655
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,600
<font color="yellow">I'll give you money, so just pretend like you bought the presents.</font>

656
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,270
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes any sense?</font>

657
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,230
<font color="yellow">That'd be just deceiving her.</font>

658
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,100
<font color="yellow">We can't save money like that.</font>

659
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,900
<font color="yellow">I'm just trying to help you.</font>

660
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,440
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I didn't hear anything.</font>

661
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,730
<font color="yellow">We need to come to an agreement.</font>

662
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,570
<font color="yellow">This won't get us anywhere.</font>

663
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,630
<font color="yellow">I won't let you loose if you ever do this again.</font>

664
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,800
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, is everything all right?</font>

665
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,330
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm scared.</font>

666
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,970
<font color="yellow">Is the door locked?</font>

667
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,030
<font color="yellow">Yes, when are you coming?</font>

668
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,200
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, I'll leave as soon as possible.</font>

669
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,770
<font color="yellow">(Jae Soon)</font>

670
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,170
<font color="yellow">Why can't you understand?</font>

671
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,630
<font color="yellow">You guys got a divorce. Why won't you let her go?</font>

672
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,730
<font color="yellow">Your not in the situation to date Jae Soon.</font>

673
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,230
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, I'm scared.</font>

674
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,370
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Dad coming?</font>

675
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,940
<font color="yellow">He'll be here soon. Don't be scared. I'm here.</font>

676
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,330
<font color="yellow">My gosh!</font>

677
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,730
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

678
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,130
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin.</font>

679
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,370
<font color="yellow">Can you come to our place? Dad hasn't come home yet.</font>

680
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,870
<font color="yellow">Are you by yourselves?</font>

681
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,330
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

682
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,830
<font color="yellow">Mum, I will be back soon.</font>

683
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,330
<font color="yellow">Where are you going so late at night?</font>

684
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,200
<font color="yellow">My boss at work called me.</font>

685
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
<font color="yellow">He wants me to help clean up the warehouse.</font>

686
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,870
<font color="yellow">I can't believe he's making you work at night.</font>

687
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,100
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

688
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,300
<font color="yellow">- Ms Shin. - Ms Shin.</font>

689
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,440
<font color="yellow">Da Rong.</font>

690
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,030
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

691
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,770
<font color="yellow">I'm here now.</font>

692
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,800
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

693
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,100
<font color="yellow">Why is the room so cold?</font>

694
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,530
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

695
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,630
<font color="yellow">It's been cold for a while.</font>

696
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,870
<font color="yellow">I wonder if the heater is broken.</font>

697
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,030
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

698
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,370
<font color="yellow">I think the heater is broken. Get dressed.</font>

699
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,070
<font color="yellow">My goodness! It's completely burned.</font>

700
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,470
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

701
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,170
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

702
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,730
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring them here?</font>

703
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,600
<font color="yellow">- Hi. - Hi.</font>

704
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,200
<font color="yellow">Mum, they said hi.</font>

705
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,440
<font color="yellow">Did you lie to me because you wanted to bring them here?</font>

706
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,370
<font color="yellow">You left the tea pot burning on the stove.</font>

707
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,670
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

708
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,940
<font color="yellow">Their heater is broken. They have to spend a night here.</font>

709
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,530
<font color="yellow">What does their broken heater have anything to do with you?</font>

710
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,870
<font color="yellow">What if Se Bang finds out about you doing this?</font>

711
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,900
<font color="yellow">He wants to get back together with you. How would this look to him?</font>

712
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,870
<font color="yellow">They can hear you.</font>

713
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go in and sleep.</font>

714
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,330
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

715
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,070
<font color="yellow">What a sight!</font>

716
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,000
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

717
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,230
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything. They will leave tomorrow.</font>

718
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,270
<font color="yellow">Of course, they should leave. Were you going to raise them?</font>

719
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,440
<font color="yellow">Do you think this makes any sense?</font>

720
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,870
<font color="yellow">Why don't you bring their father, too?</font>

721
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,370
<font color="yellow">He's on a business trip.</font>

722
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,100
<font color="yellow">If he wasn't, would you have him here, too?</font>

723
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,100
<font color="yellow">The heater's broken. What can I do?</font>

724
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,530
<font color="yellow">I can't believe what I'm hearing.</font>

725
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,130
<font color="yellow">Why don't you fix their heater, too?</font>

726
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,700
<font color="yellow">I would have if I knew how.</font>

727
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,470
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you're my child.</font>

728
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,370
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're mine?</font>

729
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,130
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure since I didn't see.</font>

730
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,440
<font color="yellow">Don't wake the kids up. Go to sleep.</font>

731
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,100
<font color="yellow">How can I sleep with them?</font>

732
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,030
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Go back to sleep.</font>

733
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,000
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

734
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,070
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

735
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,370
<font color="yellow">Did Gab Soon do something again?</font>

736
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,630
<font color="yellow">It's not Gab Soon. It's Jae Soon.</font>

737
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,930
<font color="yellow">They take turns causing trouble.</font>

738
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,270
<font color="yellow">They are driving me crazy.</font>

739
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,370
<font color="yellow">Just let it go.</font>

740
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,800
<font color="yellow">- They drove me out of the room. - What?</font>

741
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,500
<font color="yellow">She brought Geum Sik's children over.</font>

742
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,770
<font color="yellow">A Rong and Da Rong or whatever their names are.</font>

743
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,100
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

744
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,300
<font color="yellow">She said that their heater is broken.</font>

745
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,200
<font color="yellow">They're sleeping in my room right now.</font>

746
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,870
<font color="yellow">What do we do with them?</font>

747
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,130
<font color="yellow">We can't kick them out in the middle of the night.</font>

748
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,370
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that Se Bang might find out.</font>

749
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,970
<font color="yellow">He's already suspicious that Jae Soon and Geum Sik are meeting.</font>

750
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,270
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with our daughters?</font>

751
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,870
<font color="yellow">Se Gye is the only one we can count on.</font>

752
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,430
<font color="yellow">We did a poor job on raising out children...</font>

753
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,670
<font color="yellow">except for our son.</font>

754
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,630
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong. Da Rong.</font>

755
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,130
<font color="yellow">The kids are with me.</font>

756
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,630
<font color="yellow">Eat quickly and let's go to the kindergarten.</font>

757
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,200
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, what time do you have to be at school?</font>

758
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,730
<font color="yellow">I can go after breakfast.</font>

759
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,400
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, here.</font>

760
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,970
<font color="yellow">Are they back already?</font>

761
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,530
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh!</font>

762
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,870
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here this early?</font>

763
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,800
<font color="yellow">The children just left. Joong Nyeon, Geum Sik is here.</font>

764
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,530
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

765
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for barging in so early in the morning.</font>

766
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,000
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

767
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,300
<font color="yellow">If you're sorry, you shouldn't have come. Why are you here?</font>

768
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for causing a lot of trouble.</font>

769
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,330
<font color="yellow">Especially for having my children sleep over.</font>

770
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,430
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for causing inconvenience.</font>

771
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,130
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're not here just to apologise.</font>

772
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,930
<font color="yellow">I came to get your approval.</font>

773
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,830
<font color="yellow">Approval for what?</font>

774
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,100
<font color="yellow">I would like to have a good relationship with Jae Soon.</font>

775
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,900
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

776
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,800
<font color="yellow">We don't even need to respond. Just keep eating.</font>

777
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,130
<font color="yellow">Why do your sons-in-law have the worst timing?</font>

778
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,370
<font color="yellow">Why do they always come while we're eating?</font>

779
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,900
<font color="yellow">I know I shouldn't say this while you're eating.</font>

780
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,600
<font color="yellow">But I'd like to get your approval on dating Jae Soon.</font>

781
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,200
<font color="yellow">We got married within three months of our first meeting.</font>

782
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,930
<font color="yellow">The soup is cold now.</font>

783
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,000
<font color="yellow">Please give him some hot soup.</font>

784
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,300
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

785
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,700
<font color="yellow">Did you have breakfast? Eat some here.</font>

786
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,430
<font color="yellow">As I said earlier,</font>

787
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,230
<font color="yellow">because we got married so fast,</font>

788
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,070
<font color="yellow">we didn't know each other, and our marriage was rocky.</font>

789
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,100
<font color="yellow">I made Jae Soon suffer a lot.</font>

790
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,930
<font color="yellow">I know that it might sound strange...</font>

791
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,300
<font color="yellow">Don't say it if you think it'll sound strange.</font>

792
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,330
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

793
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,800
<font color="yellow">I know that both of your are concerned.</font>

794
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,000
<font color="yellow">We have feelings for each other.</font>

795
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,430
<font color="yellow">Please approve our relationship.</font>

796
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,370
<font color="yellow">You both have children to look after.</font>

797
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,530
<font color="yellow">Do you think your relationship is a game?</font>

798
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,130
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

799
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,100
<font color="yellow">- Eat. - Jae Soon.</font>

800
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,870
<font color="yellow">I don't think he should be eating with us.</font>

801
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,470
<font color="yellow">Actually, we've been seeing each other after our divorce.</font>

802
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,900
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

803
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,600
<font color="yellow">I think Jae Soon was afraid to tell you about us.</font>

804
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,830
<font color="yellow">But I think that it is proper for me to tell you...</font>

805
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:47,430
<font color="yellow">and get your approval. We want to see each other without any guilt.</font>

806
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,700
<font color="yellow">If Jae Soon had a decent job, I would give my approval.</font>

807
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,600
<font color="yellow">Her life as a woman is just as important as her life as a mother.</font>

808
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,430
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon needs to find a man who can provide for her.</font>

809
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,970
<font color="yellow">She needs to marry someone who can provide financial stability.</font>

810
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,370
<font color="yellow">- Do you understand? - Yes, I do.</font>

811
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,600
<font color="yellow">- My situation... - I know that you can date.</font>

812
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,070
<font color="yellow">You are both human, so you should date.</font>

813
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,670
<font color="yellow">But after a few years of dating,</font>

814
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,270
<font color="yellow">what happens if you break up and you get married to someone else?</font>

815
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,970
<font color="yellow">She will be older and won't be able to get married.</font>

816
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,800
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon will be in a desperate situation.</font>

817
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,500
<font color="yellow">I've said it multiple times. Why can't you see that?</font>

818
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,600
<font color="yellow">Don't be sad.</font>

819
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,530
<font color="yellow">My mum and dad just don't know you well enough.</font>

820
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,870
<font color="yellow">They don't know how wonderful you are.</font>

821
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,400
<font color="yellow">I'm not wonderful.</font>

822
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,700
<font color="yellow">They are right. I'm not financially stable.</font>

823
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,600
<font color="yellow">I don't think I will let my daughters marry someone like me.</font>

824
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,830
<font color="yellow">At times like this, I feel incompetent and lack confidence.</font>

825
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,330
<font color="yellow">I guess a man's power does come from the size of his wallet.</font>

826
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,930
<font color="yellow">Don't lose your confidence.</font>

827
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,570
<font color="yellow">I'm with you.</font>

828
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,000
<font color="yellow">You will be successful in no time.</font>

829
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,900
<font color="yellow">Stop right in front of them.</font>

830
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,000
<font color="yellow">Jo Geum Man, please move a little.</font>

831
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,530
<font color="yellow">How can you be so immature?</font>

832
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,570
<font color="yellow">You should come in soon. It's cold out here.</font>

833
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:55,270
<font color="yellow">Do you want to use my car? You can talk in there.</font>

834
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,730
<font color="yellow">I saw them in front.</font>

835
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,900
<font color="yellow">How can he come here?</font>

836
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,670
<font color="yellow">It's not what it seems. We summoned him...</font>

837
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,630
<font color="yellow">and set him straight.</font>

838
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,370
<font color="yellow">He just won't let Jae Soon alone.</font>

839
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,700
<font color="yellow">He won't listen.</font>

840
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,170
<font color="yellow">An amusement park?</font>

841
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,700
<font color="yellow">Must you do that?</font>

842
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,470
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Soo Jo has no idea?</font>

843
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,300
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

844
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,630
<font color="yellow">Do Geum.</font>

845
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,830
<font color="yellow">No matter where you go, please keep in touch. Stay alive.</font>

846
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:48,000
<font color="yellow">Sam Sik, you stay alive, too.</font>

847
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,430
<font color="yellow">We've never been apart.</font>

848
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,330
<font color="yellow">Starting from elementary school to enrolling in the military,</font>

849
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,230
<font color="yellow">we were always together.</font>

850
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,870
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about the military.</font>

851
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,770
<font color="yellow">Stop. Enough!</font>

852
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,630
<font color="yellow">Stop! That's enough!</font>

853
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,370
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

854
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,230
<font color="yellow">- Can you take a picture of us? - Sure.</font>

855
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,330
<font color="yellow">Move over.</font>

856
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,670
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3.</font>

857
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,270
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3.</font>

858
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,100
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

859
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,630
<font color="yellow">Geum Soo Jo.</font>

860
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,500
<font color="yellow">You'll always be my son, right?</font>

861
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,870
<font color="yellow">Don't forget me. I won't forget you.</font>

862
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,130
<font color="yellow">You are a fantastic son.</font>

863
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,330
<font color="yellow">Dad! Dad!</font>

864
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

865
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,370
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

866
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,030
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

867
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,630
<font color="yellow">You could have gotten hurt.</font>

868
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,600
<font color="yellow">Open the door, please.</font>

869
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

870
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,070
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

871
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,870
<font color="yellow">It's me, Geum Soo Jo.</font>

872
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,670
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

873
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,200
<font color="yellow">Let's meet now.</font>

874
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,830
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's meet.</font>

875
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,570
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

876
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:01,470
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

877
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,830
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

878
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,570
<font color="yellow">Thank you, my Soo Jo.</font>

879
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,800
<font color="yellow">I can't accept you as my family right away.</font>

880
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,430
<font color="yellow">I know what you mean. I will be patient.</font>

881
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,230
<font color="yellow">I don't know how long it will take.</font>

882
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,470
<font color="yellow">It might never happen.</font>

883
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,400
<font color="yellow">As long as you come home, I don't want anything else.</font>

884
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,470
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

885
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,030
<font color="yellow">However, I have one condition.</font>

886
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:31,030
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Whatever it is, I will do it for you.</font>

887
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,830
<font color="yellow">I will buy everything you want.</font>

888
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,470
<font color="yellow">I will buy you a car and clothes.</font>

889
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,630
<font color="yellow">I will dress you in designer clothes.</font>

890
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,230
<font color="yellow">I want to move in with my father.</font>

891
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,230
<font color="yellow">- With your father? - Yes.</font>

892
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,730
<font color="yellow">It's me. Are you busy?</font>

893
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,270
<font color="yellow">It's okay. What is it?</font>

894
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,030
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can get a loan for me?</font>

895
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,300
<font color="yellow">A loan? Why?</font>

896
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,100
<font color="yellow">I guess it's not possible.</font>

897
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,030
<font color="yellow">What is it for? Is it urgent?</font>

898
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,170
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I shouldn't have asked.</font>

899
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,670
<font color="yellow">Just erase it from your memory. Bye, then.</font>

900
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,530
<font color="yellow">Mum, about the money...</font>

901
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,630
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

902
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,370
<font color="yellow">They decided to live with Gab Dol's mum.</font>

903
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,030
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

904
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:21,830
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

905
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,670
<font color="yellow">I'm not so sure.</font>

906
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,600
<font color="yellow">Instead,</font>

907
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,670
<font color="yellow">you can give a wedding gift for her.</font>

908
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,470
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, a TV or a refrigerator.</font>

909
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

910
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,630
<font color="yellow">But I'm not sure if such things will fit in their place.</font>

911
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,400
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

912
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,100
<font color="yellow">I moved your stuff out.</font>

913
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,770
<font color="yellow">This will be your brother's room. What do you think?</font>

914
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,800
<font color="yellow">He will be here tomorrow.</font>

915
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,930
<font color="yellow">Are your parents okay with you living with them so suddenly?</font>

916
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

917
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,170
<font color="yellow">- It's fine. - Let's move into the annex.</font>

918
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,100
<font color="yellow">It's a bit cold, but we can bring in an additional heater.</font>

919
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,100
<font color="yellow">It will be fixed up as soon as the weather gets warmer.</font>

920
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,430
<font color="yellow">Please come back home.</font>

921
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,230
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo.</font>

922
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,670
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

923
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,770
<font color="yellow">it's best that we go our separate ways.</font>

924
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,570
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

925
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,400
<font color="yellow">It means just that.</font>

926
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:42,130
<font color="yellow">Perhaps...</font>

927
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,670
<font color="yellow">we were never meant to be.</font>

928
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,970
<font color="yellow">We should have loved,</font>

929
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,470
<font color="yellow">dated and then gotten married.</font>

930
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,970
<font color="yellow">We didn't do that.</font>

931
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,700
<font color="yellow">We rushed into our marriage because of our parents.</font>

932
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,170
<font color="yellow">Even our current situation is just too hard to bear.</font>

933
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,070
<font color="yellow">It's too hard for us to stay as a married couple.</font>

934
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,900
<font color="yellow">This is all I can do for you.</font>

935
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:12,830
<font color="yellow">I am so sorry.</font>

936
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,900
<font color="yellow">Don't cry. This may be better for you.</font>

937
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,530
<font color="yellow">He wants to end this marriage. Why are you crying?</font>

938
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,430
<font color="yellow">I guess he wants to quit now that things are not working out for him.</font>

939
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,370
<font color="yellow">How disrespectful.</font>

940
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,170
<font color="yellow">Se Bang was just here.</font>

941
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,630
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me anything about him. I don't care.</font>

942
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,570
<font color="yellow">Were you meeting Geum Sik?</font>

943
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:49,900
<font color="yellow">What if Se Bang finds out?</font>

944
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,430
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, Mum?</font>

945
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,130
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

946
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,070
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

947
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:03,230
<font color="yellow">She yelled at me when I told her not to meet Geum Sik.</font>

948
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,570
<font color="yellow">What if Se Bang doesn't want to get back together?</font>

949
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:09,800
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want to do.</font>

950
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,800
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

951
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,930
<font color="yellow">Are you seeing both of them?</font>

952
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,470
<font color="yellow">Why are you playing both of them?</font>

953
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,530
<font color="yellow">You need to make up your mind.</font>

954
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,230
<font color="yellow">Don't you think about your son?</font>

955
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,370
<font color="yellow">You may not think this is a big deal.</font>

956
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,400
<font color="yellow">You meet this guy today, and you meet another guy tomorrow.</font>

957
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,570
<font color="yellow">It's not like that. Why are you saying that?</font>

958
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,170
<font color="yellow">Se Bang is just Ddol Ee's father.</font>

959
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,430
<font color="yellow">I know I should stop thinking about myself...</font>

960
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,970
<font color="yellow">and just think about being a good mother.</font>

961
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,770
<font color="yellow">But I can't do that.</font>

962
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,600
<font color="yellow">I hate myself for being like this.</font>

963
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:59,700
<font color="yellow">I don't like the fact that I put my own happiness first.</font>

964
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,530
<font color="yellow">But I can't help myself.</font>

965
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,370
<font color="yellow">I still have feelings for Geum Sik.</font>

966
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,570
<font color="yellow">I like being with him.</font>

967
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,430
<font color="yellow">I just want you to be happy.</font>

968
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to give up your happiness as a woman.</font>

969
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,630
<font color="yellow">You're still so young.</font>

970
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,130
<font color="yellow">You can't live just for your child.</font>

971
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,930
<font color="yellow">You have your own life to live, too.</font>

972
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,900
<font color="yellow">But you still need to think about your child.</font>

973
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:37,900
<font color="yellow">To be frank, he keeps spending time two fathers.</font>

974
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:39,970
<font color="yellow">How confused do you think he'll be?</font>

975
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,970
<font color="yellow">Do you think he won't realise what's going on?</font>

976
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,100
<font color="yellow">Children know everything.</font>

977
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:47,900
<font color="yellow">Even dogs are capable of sensing things.</font>

978
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:50,530
<font color="yellow">Don't you think kids would sense it?</font>

979
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,730
<font color="yellow">Look at your aunt.</font>

980
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,300
<font color="yellow">She's getting everything back from her son.</font>

981
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:00,100
<font color="yellow">What I mean is,</font>

982
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,930
<font color="yellow">wait until your child grows up.</font>

983
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,170
<font color="yellow">When your child grows up, you can meet whomever you want.</font>

984
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,670
<font color="yellow">I can't let you see Geum Sik.</font>

985
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,700
<font color="yellow">Even if you date someone, meet someone who's wealthy.</font>

986
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,000
<font color="yellow">It's not good to see a guy...</font>

987
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:19,730
<font color="yellow">with money problems who'll only make you worry about what to eat.</font>

988
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,200
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

989
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,770
<font color="yellow">You're not in your 20s any more.</font>

990
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,000
<font color="yellow">You're nearly 40, and it's not so great to imagine you dating a guy...</font>

991
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,470
<font color="yellow">out in the cold.</font>

992
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,670
<font color="yellow">Stop seeing men for a while.</font>

993
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,200
<font color="yellow">Just focus on your child.</font>

994
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,570
<font color="yellow">That's my request.</font>

995
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,400
<font color="yellow">Why all of a sudden?</font>

996
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:08,100
<font color="yellow">It's not sudden. I've been thinking about this for a long time.</font>

997
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,870
<font color="yellow">Do you want to break up?</font>

998
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,700
<font color="yellow">Let's not decide on anything.</font>

999
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,500
<font color="yellow">Let's take some time to think it through.</font>

1000
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:17,400
<font color="yellow">Tell me. What this is about?</font>

1001
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,870
<font color="yellow">It's not like we can afford to get married any time soon.</font>

1002
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,970
<font color="yellow">And we're not young enough to date each other...</font>

1003
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,970
<font color="yellow">without having any future plans.</font>

1004
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,400
<font color="yellow">We have kids to look after.</font>

1005
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,900
<font color="yellow">By any chance,</font>

1006
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,800
<font color="yellow">is this because you're getting back together with Ddol Ee's dad?</font>

1007
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,700
<font color="yellow">Please be honest. I'm ready.</font>

1008
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,870
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

1009
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,430
<font color="yellow">I need to think about my life.</font>

1010
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,470
<font color="yellow">Don't call me for the time being.</font>

1011
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,470
<font color="yellow">Let's take time to think things through.</font>

1012
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,100
<font color="yellow">We're not breaking up.</font>

1013
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:57,330
<font color="yellow">If we do break up, I'll tell you.</font>

1014
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,200
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

1015
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,630
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you? You never call me first.</font>

1016
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,300
<font color="yellow">Your skirt seems too short. Do you want a hug?</font>

1017
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:35,030
<font color="yellow">This is new. Don't you dare.</font>

1018
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:40,970
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

1019
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:44,630
<font color="yellow">It's no use crying over spilled water.</font>

1020
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,400
<font color="yellow">This is us.</font>

1021
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:51,370
<font color="yellow">Don't ever show up in front of me again.</font>

1022
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,070
<font color="yellow">Hey! Jae Soon!</font>

1023
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,000
<font color="yellow">It's your grandfather.</font>

1024
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,470
<font color="yellow">- Ddol Ee. - Grandpa!</font>

1025
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,970
<font color="yellow">Grandpa!</font>

1026
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,400
<font color="yellow">- Stop! - DDol Ee, no!</font>

1027
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,200
<font color="yellow">(Our Gab Soon)</font>
