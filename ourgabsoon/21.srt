00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,090
<font color="yellow">In order to send Ddol Ee to elementary school next year,</font>

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,560
<font color="yellow">he has to be registered under Geum Sik soon. I'm worried.</font>

4
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,930
<font color="yellow">Mum, did I wet the bed?</font>

5
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

6
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,860
<font color="yellow">I was dreaming...</font>

7
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,060
<font color="yellow">It's okay. It's no shame.</font>

8
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,360
<font color="yellow">Who cares? You have nothing to be sorry for.</font>

9
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,490
<font color="yellow">I wet my bed when I was little, too.</font>

10
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,160
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry.</font>

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,560
<font color="yellow">You'll have to wash the sheets.</font>

12
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,660
<font color="yellow">I don't mind.</font>

13
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,760
<font color="yellow">Let's get changed and get back to sleep.</font>

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,890
<font color="yellow">Did Ddol Ee wet his bed?</font>

15
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,060
<font color="yellow">No, why would he?</font>

16
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,860
<font color="yellow">He perspired a lot because of fever.</font>

17
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,360
<font color="yellow">How is he feeling?</font>

18
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,490
<font color="yellow">He's feeling better now.</font>

19
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,290
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,460
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat?</font>

21
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,730
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Take me with you.</font>

22
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,160
<font color="yellow">Stay home. I have to go somewhere.</font>

23
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,590
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Why aren't you taking me?</font>

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,390
<font color="yellow">I'm asking where you are going.</font>

25
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,930
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

26
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,730
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't he speak to me? Why is he upset?</font>

27
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,330
<font color="yellow">He's mad at you. Can't you tell?</font>

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,530
<font color="yellow">That's odd.</font>

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,360
<font color="yellow">- I wonder if he's seeing a woman. - What?</font>

30
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,290
<font color="yellow">Who is kind and understanding here?</font>

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,630
<font color="yellow">If a young woman is nice to him,</font>

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,290
<font color="yellow">wouldn't he be tempted?</font>

33
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,330
<font color="yellow">That's how men are.</font>

34
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,930
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all. I sure have.</font>

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,830
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,160
<font color="yellow">Why would a young woman approach him? He has no money.</font>

37
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,760
<font color="yellow">I've seen several women who approach men who don't have money.</font>

38
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,360
<font color="yellow">My brother used to be very popular among ladies.</font>

39
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,760
<font color="yellow">You know all about it.</font>

40
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,690
<font color="yellow">I was the popular one, not him.</font>

42
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,860
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mum.</font>

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,630
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your father?</font>

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,630
<font color="yellow">- Why do you say that? - He hasn't been talking to me.</font>

45
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,230
<font color="yellow">I don't know why he's so upset.</font>

46
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,090
<font color="yellow">He goes in and out without saying a word.</font>

47
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,890
<font color="yellow">I don't know if he's found Se Bang or not.</font>

48
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'll take care of it.</font>

49
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,760
<font color="yellow">Is Ddol Ee at kindergarten?</font>

50
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,530
<font color="yellow">What? Yes.</font>

51
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,990
<font color="yellow">Then stop by.</font>

52
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,860
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to someone. It's so frustrating.</font>

53
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,530
<font color="yellow">Mum, I have an appointment.</font>

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,560
<font color="yellow">What appointment? Whom could you possibly meet?</font>

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,960
<font color="yellow">You don't even see your friends any more.</font>

56
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,430
<font color="yellow">I do have an appointment.</font>

57
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,130
<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up now, Mum.</font>

58
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,490
<font color="yellow">Has he wet the bed before?</font>

59
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,730
<font color="yellow">No, this is the first time.</font>

60
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,690
<font color="yellow">He was potty trained at an early age.</font>

61
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,190
<font color="yellow">Both his mind and body are frail, and his anxiety level is very high.</font>

62
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,660
<font color="yellow">Make sure he's relaxed and...</font>

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,660
<font color="yellow">actively show him that you're on his side.</font>

64
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,730
<font color="yellow">You mean the world to him.</font>

65
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,790
<font color="yellow">You need to be supportive.</font>

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,330
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

67
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,560
<font color="yellow">Will he get better then?</font>

68
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,790
<font color="yellow">We'll have to be patient.</font>

69
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,000
<font color="yellow">Adults are the cause of every child's problem.</font>

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,830
<font color="yellow">Mum's attitude and his relationship with the family is crucial.</font>

71
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,230
<font color="yellow">Mr Shin.</font>

72
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
<font color="yellow">Se Bang.</font>

73
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,760
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

74
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you in here?</font>

75
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,760
<font color="yellow">How did you find me?</font>

76
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,160
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm here, people stopped contacting me.</font>

77
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,730
<font color="yellow">Still, I knew you would come to see me. Please have a seat.</font>

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,030
<font color="yellow">You look better.</font>

79
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,030
<font color="yellow">They have a strict schedule here.</font>

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,000
<font color="yellow">I quit smoking and drinking and I exercise often.</font>

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,890
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too uncomfortable?</font>

82
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,460
<font color="yellow">Thanks to human rights movement,</font>

83
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,390
<font color="yellow">even the meals are not bad here.</font>

84
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,560
<font color="yellow">I deposited some money for commissary. It's not much.</font>

85
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,930
<font color="yellow">How did it happen?</font>

86
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,430
<font color="yellow">So that's how it happened.</font>

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,930
<font color="yellow">Anyway, take care of yourself.</font>

88
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,130
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

89
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,230
<font color="yellow">Is everyone doing well?</font>

90
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,960
<font color="yellow">How is Ms In?</font>

91
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,730
<font color="yellow">We're all okay.</font>

92
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,460
<font color="yellow">How is Ddol Ee?</font>

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,560
<font color="yellow">He's starting elementary school next year.</font>

94
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,390
<font color="yellow">He must have grown up a lot.</font>

95
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,130
<font color="yellow">Does the step-father treat him well?</font>

96
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,060
<font color="yellow">He does.</font>

97
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,560
<font color="yellow">He may be a step-father, but he is good to him.</font>

98
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,490
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

99
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,460
<font color="yellow">I just want Ddol Ee to be happy.</font>

100
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,330
<font color="yellow">How is Jae Soon doing?</font>

101
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,230
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

102
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,890
<font color="yellow">She's not entirely happy.</font>

103
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,030
<font color="yellow">She suffered so much because of me.</font>

104
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,290
<font color="yellow">She deserves to be happy now.</font>

105
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
<font color="yellow">Se Bang,</font>

106
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,760
<font color="yellow">you have to do this one thing.</font>

107
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,790
<font color="yellow">Have you heard about step-children adoption?</font>

108
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,490
<font color="yellow">It's a way to register under step-father...</font>

109
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,630
<font color="yellow">to give a child the same privilege as his own child.</font>

110
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,590
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

111
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:20,360
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you want to add Ddol Ee to his family register?</font>

112
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

113
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,360
<font color="yellow">Since you're here.</font>

114
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,990
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to raise a kid.</font>

115
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,890
<font color="yellow">You need a lot of money to raise a kid.</font>

116
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,790
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm out of my mind to give up my child?</font>

117
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,830
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is my child. I won't let that happen.</font>

118
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,760
<font color="yellow">He is of course your child,</font>

119
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,460
<font color="yellow">but be realistic.</font>

120
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,960
<font color="yellow">How will you support him?</font>

121
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,590
<font color="yellow">You know Jae Soon was having trouble and that's why she married.</font>

122
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,990
<font color="yellow">He'll be attending school next year.</font>

123
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,930
<font color="yellow">He'll be hurt if he has a different surname.</font>

124
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,330
<font color="yellow">It's better to add him to the family register if you think of him...</font>

125
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,860
<font color="yellow">going to university with his step-father's support.</font>

126
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,690
<font color="yellow">Does she want to live with that man by changing my child's surname?</font>

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,990
<font color="yellow">She didn't want to. I made her.</font>

128
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,260
<font color="yellow">For Ddol Ee.</font>

129
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,730
<font color="yellow">Whatever happens, I'll support Ddol Ee.</font>

130
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,630
<font color="yellow">I won't let that happen.</font>

131
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,330
<font color="yellow">Even if I'm lacking, I'm still his dad.</font>

132
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,290
<font color="yellow">If it were you, would you have allowed that?</font>

133
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,190
<font color="yellow">Don't even talk of the impossible.</font>

134
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,560
<font color="yellow">You didn't help out financially at all after the divorce.</font>

135
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,490
<font color="yellow">She cut all connections.</font>

136
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,260
<font color="yellow">Then she hurriedly got married after a year.</font>

137
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,690
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about the past.</font>

138
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,860
<font color="yellow">I came to see you to ask for permission,</font>

139
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
<font color="yellow">rather than using the law and making things difficult.</font>

140
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,230
<font color="yellow">Please understand me.</font>

141
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,600
<font color="yellow">We were like son and father.</font>

142
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,860
<font color="yellow">That's what hurts me more.</font>

143
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,130
<font color="yellow">I never imagined you'd be like this.</font>

144
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,260
<font color="yellow">It doesn't mean that you're not his dad.</font>

145
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,890
<font color="yellow">Changing his surname won't change his blood.</font>

146
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,430
<font color="yellow">I can't permit it.</font>

147
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,530
<font color="yellow">Tell Jae Soon...</font>

148
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,360
<font color="yellow">not to live like that.</font>

149
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,730
<font color="yellow">I'll see how happily she lives by changing her own child's surname.</font>

150
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,460
<font color="yellow">I'll be released next month.</font>

151
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,460
<font color="yellow">My company is doing well too.</font>

152
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,390
<font color="yellow">Don't think of me as a dead person.</font>

153
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,790
<font color="yellow">Se Bang.</font>

154
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,990
<font color="yellow">- Doesn't it look delicious? - Yes.</font>

155
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,030
<font color="yellow">It's so good.</font>

156
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have it all to myself.</font>

157
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,060
<font color="yellow">I want some.</font>

158
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,530
<font color="yellow">One spoonful for you.</font>

159
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,230
<font color="yellow">And your response?</font>

160
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,790
<font color="yellow">Wake up, Prince Ddol Ee.</font>

161
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,890
<font color="yellow">- Shall I feed you? - Yes.</font>

162
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,990
<font color="yellow">There.</font>

163
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,560
<font color="yellow">- Does it taste good? - You're the best.</font>

164
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,430
<font color="yellow">You're the best.</font>

165
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,690
<font color="yellow">Chew slowly.</font>

166
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,660
<font color="yellow">- I love you more than anything. - Me too.</font>

167
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,690
<font color="yellow">I love you more than anything in the whole world.</font>

168
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,160
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, you're home.</font>

169
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I forgot to pick you up.</font>

170
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,060
<font color="yellow">Did you come by yourself?</font>

171
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,890
<font color="yellow">I can come home by myself.</font>

172
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,430
<font color="yellow">- I need to talk to you. - She needs to talk to you.</font>

173
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,690
<font color="yellow">She seems anxious.</font>

174
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,330
<font color="yellow">Have you decided not to speak to me?</font>

175
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,960
<font color="yellow">What have I done so wrong that you're all sulky like this?</font>

176
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,090
<font color="yellow">You should be sorry to have made...</font>

177
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,990
<font color="yellow">the whole family worry and go through all that trouble.</font>

178
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,130
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live like this?</font>

179
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,460
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say to you.</font>

180
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,290
<font color="yellow">I do. Just one question.</font>

181
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,260
<font color="yellow">Why do you burst into tears so often?</font>

182
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,960
<font color="yellow">You're a man. You should be manly.</font>

183
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,460
<font color="yellow">Why do you cry and get sulky?</font>

184
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,490
<font color="yellow">I hate to see that.</font>

185
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,990
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

186
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,690
<font color="yellow">why did you talk gibberish to Se Gye?</font>

187
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,090
<font color="yellow">About me being cruel to you. That you're scared to enter the bedroom.</font>

188
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,730
<font color="yellow">Every single detail. Aren't you embarrassed to tell the kids that?</font>

189
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,160
<font color="yellow">Lastly, why won't you talk to me?</font>

190
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,030
<font color="yellow">What's the reason? What did I do?</font>

191
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,990
<font color="yellow">- Are you done? - Fourth,</font>

192
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,730
<font color="yellow">until when are you going to ignore me? Do you want to live like this?</font>

193
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,390
<font color="yellow">Do you want a divorce or what?</font>

194
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,890
<font color="yellow">- Can I answer? - Go on.</font>

195
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,390
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

196
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,960
<font color="yellow">not only women go through menopause.</font>

197
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,560
<font color="yellow">Don't you even watch television?</font>

198
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,330
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows except you.</font>

199
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,990
<font color="yellow">Now that I've aged, I don't know why but I get teary.</font>

200
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,830
<font color="yellow">Because I'm upset and anxious.</font>

201
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,860
<font color="yellow">Because I'm angry and resentful.</font>

202
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,360
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

203
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,830
<font color="yellow">I'm not done speaking.</font>

204
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,960
<font color="yellow">Second,</font>

205
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,960
<font color="yellow">what's wrong about being honest to my kids?</font>

206
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,060
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I would be embarrassed to say that?</font>

207
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,560
<font color="yellow">There was no choice.</font>

208
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,860
<font color="yellow">Third, why won't I speak to you?</font>

209
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,990
<font color="yellow">You know best.</font>

210
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,530
<font color="yellow">Fourth, until when will I not talk to you?</font>

211
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,330
<font color="yellow">Do I want a divorce?</font>

212
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,060
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Are you satisfied?</font>

213
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,030
<font color="yellow">From now on, only talk to me about our kids.</font>

214
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,860
<font color="yellow">I'll put up with this.</font>

215
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
<font color="yellow">Since I'm the better person.</font>

216
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,760
<font color="yellow">Even my name means patience, I'll live up to my name.</font>

217
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,460
<font color="yellow">What happened to Se Bang, did you find him?</font>

218
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,130
<font color="yellow">- I did. - Where is he?</font>

219
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,260
<font color="yellow">What's he doing? Will he agree?</font>

220
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,260
<font color="yellow">Don't ask any further and get out.</font>

221
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,960
<font color="yellow">Don't make me upset and get out.</font>

222
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,390
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

223
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,860
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

224
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,860
<font color="yellow">Did you get kicked out?</font>

225
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,590
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What happened to you?</font>

226
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,660
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

227
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,330
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm happy that my brother's winning.</font>

228
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,490
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

229
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,860
<font color="yellow">You wait and see.</font>

230
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,860
<font color="yellow">That looks awesome.</font>

231
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,130
<font color="yellow">What's so good about that?</font>

232
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,190
<font color="yellow">All men love cars.</font>

233
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,330
<font color="yellow">How did you feel when you rode one?</font>

234
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,190
<font color="yellow">What did you think? Was it great?</font>

235
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,790
<font color="yellow">It's all right. It's not all that great.</font>

236
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,860
<font color="yellow">I'd love to ride in a luxury car with the top down.</font>

237
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,160
<font color="yellow">You've been in one.</font>

238
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,090
<font color="yellow">Tell me how you felt.</font>

239
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,660
<font color="yellow">We'll now hear Gab Soon's thoughts on her experience in a luxury car.</font>

240
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,230
<font color="yellow">Your hair gets messy and you get dirt on your face.</font>

241
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,260
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

242
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,530
<font color="yellow">Even if your hair gets messy, it must have felt awesome.</font>

243
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,260
<font color="yellow">Who cares? Stop talking about that.</font>

244
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,130
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

245
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,560
<font color="yellow">- Your stomach must get upset. - Why?</font>

246
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,130
<font color="yellow">It's used to eating cuisines but now you eat junk food.</font>

247
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,460
<font color="yellow">It must be startled.</font>

248
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,990
<font color="yellow">I used to eat it before.</font>

249
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,090
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you today?</font>

250
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,160
<font color="yellow">- What? - Are you doing that on purpose?</font>

251
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,860
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm sorry.</font>

252
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,860
<font color="yellow">I want to be successful to take you to great places,</font>

253
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,030
<font color="yellow">but I drag you to places like this.</font>

254
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,930
<font color="yellow">- Are you being sarcastic? - No, I'm sincere.</font>

255
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,330
<font color="yellow">You deserve that.</font>

256
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,490
<font color="yellow">You deserve to ride in luxury cars...</font>

257
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,160
<font color="yellow">and go to restaurants to eat steaks.</font>

258
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,430
<font color="yellow">You met the wrong guy and always have to walk around instead.</font>

259
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,560
<font color="yellow">And eat these kind of food at snack bars.</font>

260
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,530
<font color="yellow">I feel bad.</font>

261
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,860
<font color="yellow">All women dream of meeting guys like that.</font>

262
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,860
<font color="yellow">All men...</font>

263
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,390
<font color="yellow">dream of doing that for one's girl.</font>

264
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,560
<font color="yellow">It's just that we can't afford that.</font>

265
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,730
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

266
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,460
<font color="yellow">Se Gye called an engineer to fix his computer upstairs.</font>

267
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,490
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

268
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,060
<font color="yellow">Hello. Where's the computer?</font>

269
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,130
<font color="yellow">Please follow me.</font>

270
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,890
<font color="yellow">I could never understand that.</font>

271
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,130
<font color="yellow">Would you like a glass of juice?</font>

272
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,330
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

273
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you so busy?</font>

274
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,690
<font color="yellow">- Relief Patch. - Oh, my. You startled me.</font>

275
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,060
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

276
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,590
<font color="yellow">What are you doing stuck right next to him?</font>

277
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,490
<font color="yellow">I'm helping out.</font>

278
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,390
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it difficult to learn this?</font>

279
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,800
<font color="yellow">- Are you married? - Yes.</font>

280
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,030
<font color="yellow">Since you're an expert, you must have no worries on making a living.</font>

281
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking that?</font>

282
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,860
<font color="yellow">Finish it quick and go.</font>

283
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,260
<font color="yellow">I left the stove on. Please go and turn it off.</font>

284
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,730
<font color="yellow">Isn't it over yet?</font>

285
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,390
<font color="yellow">What's taking you so long?</font>

286
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,030
<font color="yellow">Haven't you seen those people who were humiliated...</font>

287
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,800
<font color="yellow">for being bossy?</font>

288
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,830
<font color="yellow">He's already having a tough time. Don't make it worse.</font>

289
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,060
<font color="yellow">Look at him sweating.</font>

290
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,930
<font color="yellow">You should take your jacket off.</font>

291
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,730
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

292
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,360
<font color="yellow">- I'll be going. - Okay. Goodbye.</font>

293
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,330
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong, please contact me.</font>

294
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,330
<font color="yellow">I'll be on stand by day or night.</font>

295
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,490
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

296
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,730
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

297
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,800
<font color="yellow">His name is...</font>

298
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,990
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

299
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,260
<font color="yellow">Are you going to call him?</font>

300
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,990
<font color="yellow">When there's something wrong.</font>

301
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,130
<font color="yellow">You're a player.</font>

302
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,230
<font color="yellow">If I were, I wouldn't live like this.</font>

303
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,360
<font color="yellow">He's young to be your son.</font>

304
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,230
<font color="yellow">He's not that young.</font>

305
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,330
<font color="yellow">At most, he's 24 years younger than me.</font>

306
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,630
<font color="yellow">I'm only 12 years older than you.</font>

307
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,030
<font color="yellow">You're older. I'm talking about younger men.</font>

308
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,690
<font color="yellow">You and your younger men.</font>

309
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,890
<font color="yellow">Who doesn't like young men?</font>

310
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,660
<font color="yellow">Look at the young men who appear on television. Everyone loves them.</font>

311
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,490
<font color="yellow">Is money power? Youth is power.</font>

312
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,890
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

313
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,260
<font color="yellow">People are great judge of character.</font>

314
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

315
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,590
<font color="yellow">I don't know why people look at me like that.</font>

316
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,800
<font color="yellow">The service engineer thought that...</font>

317
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,960
<font color="yellow">I lived here and you were my father.</font>

318
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,360
<font color="yellow">Bring him to me!</font>

319
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,390
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

320
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,130
<font color="yellow">Mother wants me to call every day.</font>

321
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,390
<font color="yellow">What do I say? I have nothing to say.</font>

322
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,860
<font color="yellow">Even if it's not everyday, it's your duty to call once in a while.</font>

323
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,890
<font color="yellow">I hope you can do at least that.</font>

324
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,260
<font color="yellow">Hearing her voice just makes me nervous.</font>

325
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,730
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

326
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,390
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo,</font>

327
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,060
<font color="yellow">when you order Chinese food, don't they give you coupons?</font>

328
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,190
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Each time you call Mum,</font>

329
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,630
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a coupon.</font>

330
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,300
<font color="yellow">What do you get when you collect 10 coupons?</font>

331
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,860
<font color="yellow">A small dish of tangsuyuk.</font>

332
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,330
<font color="yellow">If you collect 10 coupons,</font>

333
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,190
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you what you want.</font>

334
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,690
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

335
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,590
<font color="yellow">How's Ddol Ee?</font>

336
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,390
<font color="yellow">I'm going to let him rest for a while.</font>

337
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,760
<font color="yellow">Did you take him to the hospital?</font>

338
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,430
<font color="yellow">It's not that serious. I think he must have been tired.</font>

339
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,130
<font color="yellow">I received a text message from a counselling centre.</font>

340
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,760
<font color="yellow">Why did you go there?</font>

341
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,830
<font color="yellow">All the kids went to a psychology consultant.</font>

342
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,090
<font color="yellow">- Everyone did it. - I see.</font>

343
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,530
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, look here.</font>

344
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,930
<font color="yellow">Let's make friends.</font>

345
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
<font color="yellow">To the dinosaur...</font>

346
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,960
<font color="yellow">(Heart and Empathy, Child Counselling Centre)</font>

347
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,430
<font color="yellow">- I'll pay in cash. - Okay.</font>

348
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,660
<font color="yellow">What are you up to?</font>

349
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,560
<font color="yellow">As you can see.</font>

350
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,730
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to do. I feel bored.</font>

351
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,530
<font color="yellow">Maybe a snack would help.</font>

352
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,930
<font color="yellow">Do you want some pancakes?</font>

353
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,130
<font color="yellow">I never thought I'd hear that come out from your mouth.</font>

354
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,460
<font color="yellow">Do you have a favour to ask?</font>

355
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,060
<font color="yellow">Aren't you glad that I'm taking you out like this once a month?</font>

356
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,260
<font color="yellow">Have you finished making kimchi today?</font>

357
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,730
<font color="yellow">We're going to make pancakes later.</font>

358
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,560
<font color="yellow">I have a housekeeper so I don't do those things.</font>

359
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,090
<font color="yellow">You could enter a pancake competition, right?</font>

360
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,930
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

361
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,960
<font color="yellow">She entered a competition and won third place.</font>

362
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,730
<font color="yellow">I'm not that great, but not too bad either.</font>

363
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,330
<font color="yellow">People who say that are always great.</font>

364
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,860
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim,</font>

365
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,430
<font color="yellow">I was wondering who Gong Joo took after. I see it's her mother.</font>

366
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,260
<font color="yellow">Isn't she beautiful like me?</font>

367
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,930
<font color="yellow">You two will win in a competition to drive people crazy.</font>

368
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,990
<font color="yellow">Since it's not every day that you come out,</font>

369
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,290
<font color="yellow">you should take a look around the hotel.</font>

370
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,730
<font color="yellow">Check the restroom.</font>

371
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,230
<font color="yellow">These places have great restrooms.</font>

372
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,630
<font color="yellow">What's so great about where you release your excrement?</font>

373
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,490
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

374
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,060
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy the coffee.</font>

375
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,090
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure you know, but this is expensive.</font>

376
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,190
<font color="yellow">The smell is different.</font>

377
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,060
<font color="yellow">Who cares about the smell? Tea house coffees are the best.</font>

378
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,560
<font color="yellow">Tea house coffee?</font>

379
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,160
<font color="yellow">If you haven't tried it, be still.</font>

380
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,930
<font color="yellow">There are two imbeciles who don't know anything about coffee.</font>

381
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,360
<font color="yellow">First are those who go crazy over...</font>

382
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,260
<font color="yellow">anything that's expensive.</font>

383
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,590
<font color="yellow">Second are those who stake out at the town's tea house...</font>

384
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,230
<font color="yellow">the whole day to catch a glimpse of the girls who work there.</font>

385
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,060
<font color="yellow">Haven't you heard that before?</font>

386
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,190
<font color="yellow">You must be the same as me.</font>

387
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,330
<font color="yellow">Which university did you go to?</font>

388
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,360
<font color="yellow">Tea House University, Coffee major.</font>

389
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,090
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

390
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,560
<font color="yellow">your amount of schooling is the same as me.</font>

391
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,590
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest.</font>

392
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,230
<font color="yellow">Weren't you a delinquent in school?</font>

393
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,860
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

394
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,530
<font color="yellow">Then a bully?</font>

395
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,490
<font color="yellow">With a pretty face,</font>

396
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,890
<font color="yellow">you must have hung out with them like me.</font>

397
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,190
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam, give me water.</font>

398
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,490
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

399
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you so loose-tongued?</font>

400
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,330
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

401
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,730
<font color="yellow">Did you tell others that I didn't graduate from high school?</font>

402
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,360
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what you mean.</font>

403
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,860
<font color="yellow">You told them that I was a delinquent and a bully.</font>

404
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,790
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know about that.</font>

405
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,290
<font color="yellow">Whether you were a delinquent or a bully.</font>

406
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,260
<font color="yellow">Did you even tell them that my tooth broke?</font>

407
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,260
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you didn't?</font>

408
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,930
<font color="yellow">Who else could have told that?</font>

409
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,590
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam!</font>

410
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,930
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

411
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

412
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,290
<font color="yellow">I'll take a pass.</font>

413
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,990
<font color="yellow">Did you see her face?</font>

414
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,930
<font color="yellow">How could you think up those words?</font>

415
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,560
<font color="yellow">Tea House University Coffee major?</font>

416
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,560
<font color="yellow">It makes me laugh.</font>

417
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,460
<font color="yellow">I nearly entered a speech contest.</font>

418
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,160
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - You're so funny.</font>

419
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,690
<font color="yellow">I just got out of the library.</font>

420
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,460
<font color="yellow">All right. See you there.</font>

421
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,590
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

422
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,560
<font color="yellow">A passing car honked at me.</font>

423
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

424
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

425
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,930
<font color="yellow">You didn't reply.</font>

426
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,530
<font color="yellow">- Will you go out with me? - You must be insane.</font>

427
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
<font color="yellow">You're cute.</font>

428
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,590
<font color="yellow">I'm letting you off like this because I'm also responsible.</font>

429
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,190
<font color="yellow">I must have lost my mind.</font>

430
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,590
<font color="yellow">Don't show your face to me again.</font>

431
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,730
<font color="yellow">I want to work at a high-paying part time job.</font>

432
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,060
<font color="yellow">I live off part time jobs.</font>

433
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,830
<font color="yellow">I'm craving for tteokbokki. Do you have any money?</font>

434
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,460
<font color="yellow">Let's eat at home.</font>

435
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,360
<font color="yellow">When will they post the results?</font>

436
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,090
<font color="yellow">I think this week.</font>

437
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,960
<font color="yellow">Don't forget our promise.</font>

438
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,960
<font color="yellow">Our promise?</font>

439
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,860
<font color="yellow">That you'll propose to me when you pass the exam.</font>

440
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,460
<font color="yellow">With 100 roses.</font>

441
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,690
<font color="yellow">You said that 10 years ago.</font>

442
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,460
<font color="yellow">Let's forget that.</font>

443
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,830
<font color="yellow">I have nothing. I don't even have money to rent a room.</font>

444
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,460
<font color="yellow">I want to take that back.</font>

445
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,430
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

446
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,260
<font color="yellow">It's Mum.</font>

447
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,330
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

448
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,090
<font color="yellow">I told you not to greet me.</font>

449
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,330
<font color="yellow">I told you to pretend you don't know me.</font>

450
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,730
<font color="yellow">He bumped into you. He can't not say hello.</font>

451
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,490
<font color="yellow">You would've said he's rude if he hadn't.</font>

452
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,130
<font color="yellow">Why are you in this neighbourhood looking blank?</font>

453
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,590
<font color="yellow">Why are you going through the trash?</font>

454
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,890
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going through the trash.</font>

455
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,060
<font color="yellow">Don't be so hard on him.</font>

456
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,930
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if he becomes your son-in-law?</font>

457
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,560
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon. Watch your tongue.</font>

458
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,460
<font color="yellow">This is what drives me away from you.</font>

459
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,560
<font color="yellow">Drive? You don't even have a car.</font>

460
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,090
<font color="yellow">How can you be driven away?</font>

461
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,560
<font color="yellow">You're the one who sold our car.</font>

462
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,490
<font color="yellow">I should watch my words.</font>

463
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,830
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - I said don't greet me.</font>

464
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,760
<font color="yellow">Don't greet her.</font>

465
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,230
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

466
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,830
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your mum?</font>

467
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,660
<font color="yellow">What is she going to do if I pass the exam?</font>

468
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,190
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

469
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,660
<font color="yellow">I don't look blank.</font>

470
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,990
<font color="yellow">I'll pass no matter what. I'm 3,000 percent sure.</font>

471
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,030
<font color="yellow">Is it you, Gab Soon?</font>

472
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,860
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - What is it?</font>

473
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,330
<font color="yellow">Does Gab Dol still call you?</font>

474
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,930
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

475
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,490
<font color="yellow">Then why is he hovering around our neighbourhood?</font>

476
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,190
<font color="yellow">I saw him going through the trash earlier.</font>

477
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,860
<font color="yellow">I hate to see people going through the trash.</font>

478
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,260
<font color="yellow">This isn't just our neighbourhood. It's also his neighbourhood.</font>

479
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,990
<font color="yellow">We went to the same school.</font>

480
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,490
<font color="yellow">Isn't he hovering around here to see you?</font>

481
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,790
<font color="yellow">Of course not. I'm sure he came for something else.</font>

482
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,760
<font color="yellow">Why would he go through the trash?</font>

483
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Was he going through the trash?</font>

484
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,360
<font color="yellow">That's enough, Nae Shim.</font>

485
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,390
<font color="yellow">They're already talking to each other.</font>

486
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,990
<font color="yellow">Don't just assume things.</font>

487
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,930
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon is always right.</font>

488
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,590
<font color="yellow">I don't like how he dresses, either.</font>

489
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,260
<font color="yellow">He always goes around dragging his flip-flops.</font>

490
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,860
<font color="yellow">Look at his eyes. He's a squit.</font>

491
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,060
<font color="yellow">The eyes of successful people always sparkle.</font>

492
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,630
<font color="yellow">His eyes are totally blank as if he's lying in a warm room.</font>

493
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,630
<font color="yellow">No. His eyes sparkle, too.</font>

494
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,530
<font color="yellow">He did well on the exam. He's waiting for the good news.</font>

495
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,590
<font color="yellow">He won't date me even if I asked him to.</font>

496
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,730
<font color="yellow">His mum wants him to marry a teacher.</font>

497
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,890
<font color="yellow">- Is he going to pass? - He did well on the exam.</font>

498
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,890
<font color="yellow">You don't know that until he really passes.</font>

499
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
<font color="yellow">It's not like he already passed.</font>

500
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,090
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare see him before he does.</font>

501
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,960
<font color="yellow">She will. Joong Nyeon will have to stop you from killing her.</font>

502
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,860
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

503
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,390
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

504
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,260
<font color="yellow">She spoils everything.</font>

505
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,430
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is a bedwetter</font>

506
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,430
<font color="yellow">He is a bedwetter</font>

507
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,990
<font color="yellow">No. I'm not a bedwetter.</font>

508
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,530
<font color="yellow">Aren't you too old to wet your bed?</font>

509
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,290
<font color="yellow">Da Rong. Don't make fun of him.</font>

510
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
<font color="yellow">Apologise to him now.</font>

511
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,590
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why are you scolding Da Rong?</font>

512
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,330
<font color="yellow">Because she did something wrong. Ddol Ee didn't wet his bed.</font>

513
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,060
<font color="yellow">We're family now. Don't make fun of each other.</font>

514
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,990
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, it's wrong. Apologise to Ddol Ee.</font>

515
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,930
<font color="yellow">Don't scold Da Rong.</font>

516
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,060
<font color="yellow">I told you. From now on, I'll say what I want to say,</font>

517
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,430
<font color="yellow">and I'll scold you when I have to.</font>

518
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,360
<font color="yellow">Eat some snacks and go to the piano lesson.</font>

519
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,530
<font color="yellow">I don't need it.</font>

520
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,030
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, let's go.</font>

521
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,290
<font color="yellow">She scolded Da Rong?</font>

522
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,630
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you when we were at your house,</font>

523
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,690
<font color="yellow">but I didn't because it would worry you and Mum.</font>

524
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,290
<font color="yellow">These days, she only cares about Ddol Ee.</font>

525
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,590
<font color="yellow">Dad has changed as well.</font>

526
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,460
<font color="yellow">He only takes her side and scolds us.</font>

527
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,760
<font color="yellow">Why would he scold you?</font>

528
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

529
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,690
<font color="yellow">He yelled at me,</font>

530
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,060
<font color="yellow">and told me to apologise to her.</font>

531
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,060
<font color="yellow">She's scary. I try to be tough with her so she wouldn't...</font>

532
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,660
<font color="yellow">look down on us, but it's not working any more.</font>

533
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,490
<font color="yellow">Are your dad and Ms Shin on good terms?</font>

534
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,490
<font color="yellow">Don't they fight?</font>

535
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,490
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen them fight.</font>

536
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,030
<font color="yellow">Never?</font>

537
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,660
<font color="yellow">Mum often lashes out at Dad,</font>

538
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,930
<font color="yellow">but Ms Shin always curries favour with Dad.</font>

539
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,860
<font color="yellow">When Dad goes to work, she comes and adjusts...</font>

540
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,790
<font color="yellow">his clothes and gives him a kiss.</font>

541
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,730
<font color="yellow">She sounds like someone as cunning as a fox.</font>

542
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,330
<font color="yellow">I wonder what she has done to him. He's a blunt guy.</font>

543
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,030
<font color="yellow">Giving his wife kisses every day doesn't sound like him.</font>

544
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,530
<font color="yellow">It looks like she's fawning upon him.</font>

545
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,530
<font color="yellow">Any men would fall for that.</font>

546
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,560
<font color="yellow">- Doesn't that upset you? - It doesn't.</font>

547
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,330
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik never carried shopping bags for you.</font>

548
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,230
<font color="yellow">He never cleaned the yard.</font>

549
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,230
<font color="yellow">He was always out saying he's busy.</font>

550
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,760
<font color="yellow">He's so crazy about her that he doesn't even care about the kids.</font>

551
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,730
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

552
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,660
<font color="yellow">Thanks to my great daughter,</font>

553
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,190
<font color="yellow">I can't let a young worker pass by.</font>

554
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,830
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking if he would earn enough money to feed you.</font>

555
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,060
<font color="yellow">I even asked the computer repairman...</font>

556
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,390
<font color="yellow">if he earns enough money.</font>

557
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,490
<font color="yellow">Then the old codger misunderstood me.</font>

558
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,760
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong tries to be tough with her,</font>

559
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,860
<font color="yellow">so she won't look down on them, but it's not working any more.</font>

560
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,760
<font color="yellow">She treated the kids carefully at first, but she doesn't any more.</font>

561
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,230
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik said he married her for the kids' sake. What an excuse.</font>

562
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,260
<font color="yellow">He just fell for her.</font>

563
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,660
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik is married and happy. Don't cling on to him.</font>

564
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,530
<font color="yellow">- You look desperate. - They have kids together.</font>

565
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,690
<font color="yellow">Even so, they're already divorced.</font>

566
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,890
<font color="yellow">You're doing this because he's rich, right?</font>

567
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,490
<font color="yellow">Don't encourage her. Don't you have any pride?</font>

568
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,090
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone so crazy about rich men?</font>

569
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,630
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be.</font>

570
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,830
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee. You can play with it after dinner.</font>

571
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,260
<font color="yellow">Dad. Scold him.</font>

572
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,760
<font color="yellow">You can't play with toys when you're eating, right?</font>

573
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,960
<font color="yellow">Da Rong. Telling tales is bad.</font>

574
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,830
<font color="yellow">Don't do that to your friends at school.</font>

575
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,790
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee. Let's eat first, and play with it later.</font>

576
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,730
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin. Give me some water.</font>

577
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,930
<font color="yellow">Why don't you get it yourself?</font>

578
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,060
<font color="yellow">You're old enough to do that.</font>

579
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,530
<font color="yellow">Also, Cho Rong and Da Rong,</font>

580
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,630
<font color="yellow">put your dishes in the sink after you finish eating from now on.</font>

581
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,090
<font color="yellow">Can you do that for me?</font>

582
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll sleep with Ddol Ee for a few days.</font>

583
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,830
<font color="yellow">"The three pig brothers were walking on a street."</font>

584
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,960
<font color="yellow">"The eldest pig sank down on the ground."</font>

585
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,530
<font color="yellow">"Gosh, I'm too lazy. I'll just build my house with straws."</font>

586
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,390
<font color="yellow">"The lazy eldest pig started"...</font>

587
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,660
<font color="yellow">"to weave the straws."</font>

588
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,360
<font color="yellow">"I'm too tired. I'll just build my house with the tree branches."</font>

589
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,060
<font color="yellow">Da Rong. You're awake.</font>

590
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,060
<font color="yellow">- I want to pee. - Okay.</font>

591
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,200
<font color="yellow">"The second pig brother made a sloppy house, and took a rest."</font>

592
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,890
<font color="yellow">"The hard-working youngest pig"...</font>

593
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,430
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

594
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,260
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm the one who raised you poorly.</font>

595
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,260
<font color="yellow">There is no one to blame.</font>

596
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,160
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

597
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,790
<font color="yellow">That woman is nice and gentle.</font>

598
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,330
<font color="yellow">She also knows how to please Geum Sik.</font>

599
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,730
<font color="yellow">I guess it's because she has been well-loved by her parents.</font>

600
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,090
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

601
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,590
<font color="yellow">After your father died,</font>

602
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,760
<font color="yellow">I've done all kinds of things so I can feed you.</font>

603
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
<font color="yellow">I worked at restaurants and other people's houses.</font>

604
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,960
<font color="yellow">I sold all sorts of things on the street.</font>

605
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,230
<font color="yellow">Because of that, I couldn't raise you right.</font>

606
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,030
<font color="yellow">I didn't make you starve,</font>

607
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,130
<font color="yellow">but I didn't give you enough affection.</font>

608
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,530
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it,</font>

609
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,130
<font color="yellow">that's when you were going through puberty.</font>

610
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,260
<font color="yellow">You had to take care of Gab Dol and do the house chores.</font>

611
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,660
<font color="yellow">I didn't buy you...</font>

612
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,760
<font color="yellow">anything good or pretty.</font>

613
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,560
<font color="yellow">I could've used words,</font>

614
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,560
<font color="yellow">but I yelled at you and hit you instead.</font>

615
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,560
<font color="yellow">It's because you were having a hard time.</font>

616
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,830
<font color="yellow">Frankly, I often took out my anger on you.</font>

617
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,290
<font color="yellow">I never hit Gab Dol,</font>

618
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,890
<font color="yellow">but I hit you a lot.</font>

619
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,230
<font color="yellow">I deserved it.</font>

620
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
<font color="yellow">I hung out with delinquent girls,</font>

621
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,590
<font color="yellow">never listened to you,</font>

622
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,430
<font color="yellow">abandoned Gab Dol and stayed out late.</font>

623
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,700
<font color="yellow">I deserved a beating.</font>

624
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,760
<font color="yellow">You didn't want any guys to make passes at you,</font>

625
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,590
<font color="yellow">so you started yelling at men not to look at you.</font>

626
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,760
<font color="yellow">I should've comforted you well.</font>

627
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,200
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault that...</font>

628
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,890
<font color="yellow">I gave you such an ill fate.</font>

629
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,700
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

630
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,130
<font color="yellow">This is Shin Joong Nyeon.</font>

631
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,330
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

632
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,560
<font color="yellow">A prison officer?</font>

633
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,830
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

634
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

635
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,990
<font color="yellow">Didn't you do the laundry? I put them out a long time ago.</font>

636
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,390
<font color="yellow">If you need it, wash it yourself.</font>

637
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,790
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you cleaning my room?</font>

638
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee. It's time to go to school.</font>

639
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,560
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

640
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,130
<font color="yellow">Let's not go, then.</font>

641
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,790
<font color="yellow">Shall we go out and have fun?</font>

642
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,860
<font color="yellow">Let's go to an amusement park. Da Rong said she went there.</font>

643
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,790
<font color="yellow">Sure. We can go there, too.</font>

644
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,330
<font color="yellow">Let's go to an amusement park, okay?</font>

645
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,430
<font color="yellow">I'm so excited!</font>

646
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,330
<font color="yellow">Today is your day off, right?</font>

647
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,160
<font color="yellow">I'm going out in the evening.</font>

648
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,430
<font color="yellow">I'll be back before then.</font>

649
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,730
<font color="yellow">Please pick up Da Rong when she gets back from school.</font>

650
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,230
<font color="yellow">I prepared some snacks.</font>

651
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,460
<font color="yellow">Give them to Cho Rong and Da Rong, and send them to their lessons.</font>

652
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,130
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

653
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,200
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

654
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,790
<font color="yellow">- I have some errands... - To an amusement park.</font>

655
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,530
<font color="yellow">An amusement park?</font>

656
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,060
<font color="yellow">Are you two going to an amusement park?</font>

657
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,890
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why?</font>

658
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,260
<font color="yellow">How can you go there...</font>

659
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,360
<font color="yellow">without Cho Rong and Da Rong?</font>

660
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,890
<font color="yellow">Why can't I?</font>

661
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,260
<font color="yellow">Giving the girls some food isn't so hard.</font>

662
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,860
<font color="yellow">They're your nieces.</font>

663
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,930
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later. Let's go, Ddol Ee.</font>

664
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:19,930
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

665
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,860
<font color="yellow">I'm free.</font>

666
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,060
<font color="yellow">I got rid of all the girls.</font>

667
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,830
<font color="yellow">I'm lonely.</font>

668
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,760
<font color="yellow">(Private Tutoring)</font>

669
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,960
<font color="yellow">(Private Tutoring)</font>

670
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,560
<font color="yellow">(Private Tutoring)</font>

671
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,330
<font color="yellow">They won't be able to remove it now.</font>

672
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

673
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,130
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do after Soo Jo gets married?</font>

674
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,230
<font color="yellow">Do Geum. Isn't it time to tell him the truth?</font>

675
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,860
<font color="yellow">What truth?</font>

676
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,290
<font color="yellow">I'll take it to my grave.</font>

677
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,630
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right there.</font>

678
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

679
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,260
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

680
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,060
<font color="yellow">She told me to open it at home.</font>

681
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,430
<font color="yellow">It's money.</font>

682
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,630
<font color="yellow">This is the pay for yesterday.</font>

683
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,460
<font color="yellow">These are the flyers for today.</font>

684
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,760
<font color="yellow">You're hard-working.</font>

685
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,230
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'll do my best.</font>

686
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,760
<font color="yellow">I normally don't believe in coincidence.</font>

687
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,630
<font color="yellow">Anyway, aren't you happy to see me?</font>

688
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:03,930
<font color="yellow">Don't get cute with me.</font>

689
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,160
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gab Soon.</font>

690
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,590
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

691
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,730
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll go out with you?</font>

692
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,860
<font color="yellow">If you do this again, I won't stand it.</font>

693
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,130
<font color="yellow">You dropped this.</font>

694
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,830
<font color="yellow">Should I eat it?</font>

695
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,730
<font color="yellow">Mum. I can marry Gab Dol if he passes the exam, right?</font>

696
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,690
<font color="yellow">Are you sure he'll pass?</font>

697
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,890
<font color="yellow">You can feel it after the exam.</font>

698
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,330
<font color="yellow">He thinks he will pass.</font>

699
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,660
<font color="yellow">If he passes, you can.</font>

700
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,790
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

701
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,560
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mum.</font>

702
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,790
<font color="yellow">She can't marry anyone else.</font>

703
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,490
<font color="yellow">They dated for 10 years and even lived together.</font>

704
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,530
<font color="yellow">If he passes, beg him to take her. You should.</font>

705
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,230
<font color="yellow">I don't need to beg,</font>

706
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,230
<font color="yellow">but I'm worried about his mother.</font>

707
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,760
<font color="yellow">I'm also worried about Jae Soon. Can she really marry him?</font>

708
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,260
<font color="yellow">People even become in-laws with the same person twice.</font>

709
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,030
<font color="yellow">You'll be a bit uncomfortable, but it won't be a problem.</font>

710
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:58,830
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

711
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,630
<font color="yellow">she has the final say. Would she let them get married?</font>

712
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,330
<font color="yellow">Even if she approves it because of Gab Dol,</font>

713
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,960
<font color="yellow">what if she abuses Gab Soon?</font>

714
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,990
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon may be miserable.</font>

715
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,930
<font color="yellow">They can move out, then.</font>

716
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,890
<font color="yellow">They'll see her only a few times in a year. Look at me.</font>

717
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,160
<font color="yellow">After Se Gye got married, I hardly see Gong Joo.</font>

718
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,830
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I guess being a public official is a big deal.</font>

719
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,660
<font color="yellow">It changed your mind completely.</font>

720
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,860
<font color="yellow">Kids don't listen to their parents any more.</font>

721
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,130
<font color="yellow">If they like each other, I can't do anything about it.</font>

722
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,260
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm happy about it.</font>

723
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,160
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Mum. I'll be good.</font>

724
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,590
<font color="yellow">You can see him if he passes.</font>

725
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,490
<font color="yellow">If he fails, don't even think about it.</font>

726
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,830
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

727
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,060
<font color="yellow">Do you really believe that?</font>

728
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,630
<font color="yellow">You know so little about your kids.</font>

729
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,690
<font color="yellow">I guess it makes you carefree.</font>

730
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,190
<font color="yellow">Who would it be?</font>

731
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,130
<font color="yellow">- Who is it? - Delivery service.</font>

732
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,730
<font color="yellow">Are you Ms Shin Gab Soon?</font>

733
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,230
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Please sign here.</font>

734
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,590
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Thank you.</font>

735
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:07,590
<font color="yellow">They're apples.</font>

736
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,360
<font color="yellow">We just ran out of apples. Who sent you these?</font>

737
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,660
<font color="yellow">As an apology,</font>

738
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,230
<font color="yellow">I sent you a box of apples.</font>

739
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,790
<font color="yellow">I hope you like them.</font>

740
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,490
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Gab Soon! - Gab Soon!</font>

741
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,060
<font color="yellow">I don't need apples. Tell him not to act up.</font>

742
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,190
<font color="yellow">Make sure you do.</font>

743
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,460
<font color="yellow">It's warm.</font>

744
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,430
<font color="yellow">Mum says we can get married once you pass the exam.</font>

745
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,190
<font color="yellow">She says we can get married once I pass?</font>

746
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,960
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's making my heart flutter.</font>

747
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,260
<font color="yellow">It'd be great for us to live together.</font>

748
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,330
<font color="yellow">We've done it before.</font>

749
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,890
<font color="yellow">That's before we got married. Our parents almost killed us.</font>

750
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,490
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do it again.</font>

751
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,830
<font color="yellow">I think we should get married with everybody congratulating us.</font>

752
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,930
<font color="yellow">Where should our wedding be?</font>

753
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,760
<font color="yellow">It's up to you.</font>

754
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,690
<font color="yellow">We can't do it at a hotel.</font>

755
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,930
<font color="yellow">A nice Catholic church? An outdoor wedding?</font>

756
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,160
<font color="yellow">- It's up to you. - What about our honeymoon?</font>

757
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,630
<font color="yellow">Let's have a small wedding and go on a nice honeymoon.</font>

758
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,030
<font color="yellow">We've never gone abroad.</font>

759
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,260
<font color="yellow">Passports. We should get passports first.</font>

760
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,860
<font color="yellow">Where do you want to go?</font>

761
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,930
<font color="yellow">It's up to you.</font>

762
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,590
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - What?</font>

763
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,230
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.</font>

764
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,630
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going to take the exam? - What?</font>

765
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,090
<font color="yellow">I didn't study much this time so I don't think I'm taking it.</font>

766
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,030
<font color="yellow">There are not too many dates left. I'll take it next year.</font>

767
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,760
<font color="yellow">What are you planning to do?</font>

768
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,030
<font color="yellow">I thought you wanted to be a teacher.</font>

769
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,390
<font color="yellow">You can't keep doing this.</font>

770
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,960
<font color="yellow">There are not too many dates left so you should be pulling all-nighters.</font>

771
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,990
<font color="yellow">We can't make a living with just me making money.</font>

772
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,230
<font color="yellow">We can't have just one person working per household nowadays.</font>

773
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,990
<font color="yellow">We both come from poor families so we should both be making money.</font>

774
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,960
<font color="yellow">You have no sense of conscience. You're planning to live off of me.</font>

775
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,560
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I have no sense of conscience?</font>

776
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:16,960
<font color="yellow">I take that back.</font>

777
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,590
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to mooch you off. I'm going to take it next year.</font>

778
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,160
<font color="yellow">I'll start studying again once we get married.</font>

779
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,530
<font color="yellow">Aren't we going to have babies?</font>

780
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,390
<font color="yellow">Should I have a baby first and then study?</font>

781
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,190
<font color="yellow">You've already made up your mind. You're going to mooch off of me.</font>

782
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,390
<font color="yellow">You said you loved me.</font>

783
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,830
<font color="yellow">This has nothing to do with that.</font>

784
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,960
<font color="yellow">Women are funny.</font>

785
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,890
<font color="yellow">You try to make excuses over love.</font>

786
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,560
<font color="yellow">If I pick up your call late, you say, "Do you love me?"</font>

787
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,690
<font color="yellow">If I forget about your birthday, you say, "Do you even love me?"</font>

788
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,930
<font color="yellow">Then, did you want both of us to work?</font>

789
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,560
<font color="yellow">You probably won't marry me if I don't make money.</font>

790
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,430
<font color="yellow">I see. That's what it is.</font>

791
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,290
<font color="yellow">I'll leave. Good luck finding a working woman.</font>

792
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,560
<font color="yellow">I said that because I don't want you to abandon your dream.</font>

793
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,190
<font color="yellow">You can't throw away your education.</font>

794
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,630
<font color="yellow">If you pull a few all-nighters, you might remember what you studied.</font>

795
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,730
<font color="yellow">You've been studying for a few years.</font>

796
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,760
<font color="yellow">I forgot it all.</font>

797
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,390
<font color="yellow">What were you doing all this time? You should have studied.</font>

798
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,260
<font color="yellow">You were busy fooling around that you didn't have time to study.</font>

799
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,590
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to study when you have time leftover.</font>

800
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,260
<font color="yellow">You can cut out all men in your life and that might still not be enough.</font>

801
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,830
<font color="yellow">That hurts.</font>

802
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,190
<font color="yellow">Must you criticise me like this?</font>

803
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:33,990
<font color="yellow">You said you won't bring it up again.</font>

804
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,030
<font color="yellow">Don't overthink. I'm talking about studying.</font>

805
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,760
<font color="yellow">You said the exact same to me.</font>

806
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,160
<font color="yellow">- Should we take a picture? - Yes.</font>

807
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,330
<font color="yellow">Say cheese.</font>

808
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:23,930
<font color="yellow">Mum, what if you get scolded?</font>

809
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,230
<font color="yellow">For coming to an amusement park.</font>

810
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,890
<font color="yellow">Who will scold me? I'll scold all of them.</font>

811
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,360
<font color="yellow">I'm strong.</font>

812
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,290
<font color="yellow">What should we go on? Let's try all the rides you like.</font>

813
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,330
<font color="yellow">Really? You're the best!</font>

814
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,030
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Mum. - Where are you?</font>

815
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,530
<font color="yellow">I have some kimchi for you. I wanted to talk as well.</font>

816
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:51,490
<font color="yellow">An amusement park?</font>

817
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,490
<font color="yellow">With Geum Sik and the kids?</font>

818
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,260
<font color="yellow">Just the two of you?</font>

819
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,430
<font color="yellow">What about the girls?</font>

820
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,730
<font color="yellow">What if Geum Sik says something?</font>

821
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,260
<font color="yellow">He can't say anything. It's my choice.</font>

822
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,030
<font color="yellow">I don't care if I'm out of favour with him.</font>

823
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,030
<font color="yellow">My child is suffering so why would that matter?</font>

824
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:12,960
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jae Soon.</font>

825
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,660
<font color="yellow">Se Bang, you asked me to come see you.</font>

826
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,830
<font color="yellow">What does Ddol Ee's...</font>

827
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,530
<font color="yellow">step-father do?</font>

828
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,760
<font color="yellow">He's a businessman.</font>

829
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,690
<font color="yellow">He has a good company and some asset.</font>

830
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,330
<font color="yellow">How is his personality?</font>

831
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,060
<font color="yellow">Is he good to Ddol Ee?</font>

832
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,830
<font color="yellow">He is. You don't have to worry.</font>

833
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,460
<font color="yellow">Does he have kids of his own?</font>

834
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,230
<font color="yellow">He does. He has two daughters.</font>

835
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,290
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee will be the youngest child on his family register.</font>

836
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,560
<font color="yellow">I'll leave Ddol Ee...</font>

837
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,830
<font color="yellow">to you.</font>

838
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:27,260
<font color="yellow">A father like me won't be good for his future.</font>

839
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,890
<font color="yellow">He's 100 times better than a bad father like me.</font>

840
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:36,830
<font color="yellow">It's for Ddol Ee.</font>

841
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,960
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

842
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,530
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about anything.</font>

843
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,260
<font color="yellow">Please, tell Jae Soon this.</font>

844
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:54,090
<font color="yellow">Tell her not worry and...</font>

845
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:59,030
<font color="yellow">raise Ddol Ee well. Tell her I hope she's happy.</font>

846
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:05,330
<font color="yellow">She deserves to be happy because I couldn't make her happy.</font>

847
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,130
<font color="yellow">Se Bang.</font>

848
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,390
<font color="yellow">I'll be there...</font>

849
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:19,330
<font color="yellow">for Ddol Ee...</font>

850
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,590
<font color="yellow">until he grows up.</font>

851
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:25,160
<font color="yellow">I'll take good care of myself and I'll take care of him...</font>

852
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:26,660
<font color="yellow">until he grows up.</font>

853
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,560
<font color="yellow">You'll be released next month?</font>

854
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,130
<font color="yellow">Call me once you get released. All right?</font>

855
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,760
<font color="yellow">I'll come back when I have time.</font>

856
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,090
<font color="yellow">Don't come back.</font>

857
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,330
<font color="yellow">Stay healthy.</font>

858
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:50,930
<font color="yellow">Eat well.</font>

859
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:53,560
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

860
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,190
<font color="yellow">Can I see Ddol Ee just once?</font>

861
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,430
<font color="yellow">Do you have a picture of him?</font>

862
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:09,930
<font color="yellow">A picture?</font>

863
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,990
<font color="yellow">I should be carrying one.</font>

864
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,990
<font color="yellow">I might have lost it.</font>

865
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,560
<font color="yellow">Here. Here it is.</font>

866
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,230
<font color="yellow">It's my background.</font>

867
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,730
<font color="yellow">I took it recently.</font>

868
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,890
<font color="yellow">Hasn't he grown a lot?</font>

869
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:08,890
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

870
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,530
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

871
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,460
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? Where's Jae Soon?</font>

872
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,730
<font color="yellow">You don't know what's going on in this house.</font>

873
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,830
<font color="yellow">- Do you know where Jae Soon is? - Isn't she home?</font>

874
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,430
<font color="yellow">She must have gone to the market.</font>

875
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,460
<font color="yellow">She went to the amusement park with Ddol Ee.</font>

876
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:26,060
<font color="yellow">- Does this make any sense? - An amusement park?</font>

877
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,460
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset. She wanted me to make Cho Rong and Da Rong's snacks.</font>

878
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,190
<font color="yellow">She didn't even pick up Da Rong.</font>

879
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,760
<font color="yellow">She only takes care of Ddol Ee. She doesn't care about the girls.</font>

880
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,330
<font color="yellow">She doesn't give them snacks or get them school supplies.</font>

881
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,430
<font color="yellow">She mistreats them and she scolds them if they don't listen.</font>

882
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,830
<font color="yellow">She even threatens them.</font>

883
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,790
<font color="yellow">Stop making up stories.</font>

884
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,460
<font color="yellow">I'm not making this up.</font>

885
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,530
<font color="yellow">She only took Ddol Ee to the amusement park.</font>

886
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:56,590
<font color="yellow">She leaves the house in a mess and doesn't clean or do the laundry.</font>

887
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,960
<font color="yellow">She's starting to show her true self.</font>

888
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,230
<font color="yellow">I met Se Bang today.</font>

889
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,890
<font color="yellow">You met him?</font>

890
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,090
<font color="yellow">Where is he? What does he do?</font>

891
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:15,960
<font color="yellow">He was doing well before,</font>

892
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,130
<font color="yellow">but he's not in the best situation right now.</font>

893
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,660
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

894
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,590
<font color="yellow">He should have focused on his business.</font>

895
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,130
<font color="yellow">He always bluffed and acted with pretentious.</font>

896
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,860
<font color="yellow">Good thing you divorced him.</font>

897
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,260
<font color="yellow">We still got a lot from him.</font>

898
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,290
<font color="yellow">He was much better than Geum Sik. It's true.</font>

899
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,760
<font color="yellow">He agreed to give Ddol Ee up for adoption.</font>

900
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,390
<font color="yellow">He was probably happy about it.</font>

901
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,960
<font color="yellow">Someone else will be raising his child for him.</font>

902
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,630
<font color="yellow">It takes over a few hundred million dollars to raise a child.</font>

903
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:47,530
<font color="yellow">Se Bang is a lucky man.</font>

904
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,190
<font color="yellow">He never paid a cent for child support after the divorce.</font>

905
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,060
<font color="yellow">And now, somebody else will be raising his child for him.</font>

906
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:56,590
<font color="yellow">Don't put it that way.</font>

907
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,930
<font color="yellow">I'm right.</font>

908
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,160
<font color="yellow">Se Bang agreed to it...</font>

909
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,690
<font color="yellow">so just be thankful.</font>

910
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,860
<font color="yellow">It's not easy for a man to agree to it.</font>

911
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,060
<font color="yellow">He was crying.</font>

912
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:12,060
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to tell you to raise Ddol Ee well.</font>

913
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,060
<font color="yellow">And he wants you to be happy.</font>

914
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,360
<font color="yellow">He's at least thoughtful.</font>

915
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,160
<font color="yellow">Of course he is.</font>

916
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,860
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Se Bang.</font>

917
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:23,790
<font color="yellow">He got divorced...</font>

918
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,260
<font color="yellow">and on top of that,</font>

919
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,960
<font color="yellow">he gets his child taken away.</font>

920
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:34,890
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

921
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:38,690
<font color="yellow">Can I think about it?</font>

922
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,090
<font color="yellow">Think about what?</font>

923
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,590
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik didn't agree to it?</font>

924
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,430
<font color="yellow">It's not about Geum Sik agreeing to it.</font>

925
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,590
<font color="yellow">I have to agree, too.</font>

926
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,460
<font color="yellow">I can't worry about Geum Sik all the time.</font>

927
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,130
<font color="yellow">I'll do it when I'm up for it.</font>

928
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,490
<font color="yellow">Even Se Bang agreed to it.</font>

929
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,290
<font color="yellow">Do it when he says yes.</font>

930
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,730
<font color="yellow">What if he changes his mind later?</font>

931
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,030
<font color="yellow">She has something else in mind.</font>

932
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,560
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

933
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,790
<font color="yellow">I don't want to gossip so ask her yourself.</font>

934
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,960
<font color="yellow">I want to think about it.</font>

935
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,390
<font color="yellow">I don't think I should do it now just for convenience.</font>

936
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,860
<font color="yellow">I have to think about Ddol Ee once he grows up.</font>

937
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,330
<font color="yellow">What if I regret it?</font>

938
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,690
<font color="yellow">Why would you regret it?</font>

939
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,790
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

940
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,660
<font color="yellow">She's too slow.</font>

941
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,230
<font color="yellow">You're like a light bulb.</font>

942
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:31,530
<font color="yellow">Light bulbs turn on instantly these days,</font>

943
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,660
<font color="yellow">but you're an outdated light bulb.</font>

944
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,160
<font color="yellow">She's going to get a divorce.</font>

945
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:37,690
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

946
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,330
<font color="yellow">I want to think about it from Ddol Ee's point of view, Mum.</font>

947
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,290
<font color="yellow">Let me do that, Dad.</font>

948
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,530
<font color="yellow">I must be thoughtless.</font>

949
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,130
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you mean by Ddol Ee's point of view.</font>

950
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,530
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

951
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,530
<font color="yellow">I went to the amusement park.</font>

952
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,530
<font color="yellow">What time is it? How...</font>

953
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,860
<font color="yellow">You'll wake Ddol Ee up. Let's talk later.</font>

954
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,230
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin.</font>

955
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,090
<font color="yellow">I have to take this to school. I need you to do it now.</font>

956
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,660
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

957
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,760
<font color="yellow">I can't do it right now.</font>

958
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:56,760
<font color="yellow">You can go to school. I'll drop it off.</font>

959
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,230
<font color="yellow">Don't come to school.</font>

960
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,260
<font color="yellow">Do it now.</font>

961
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,130
<font color="yellow">You should have told me earlier.</font>

962
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:04,760
<font color="yellow">You can't ask me to do it right now.</font>

963
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:06,960
<font color="yellow">If you don't tell me ahead of time, I won't do it for you.</font>

964
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,460
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to get punished at school?</font>

965
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,830
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

966
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,460
<font color="yellow">If you did something wrong, you need to get punished for it.</font>

967
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,660
<font color="yellow">If you don't want that to happen, tell me earlier from now on.</font>

968
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,990
<font color="yellow">I'm not a robot. I can't do everything in a second.</font>

969
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,430
<font color="yellow">Jo Cho Rong! Come here.</font>

970
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,060
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

971
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,360
<font color="yellow">She won't help me prepare my school supply.</font>

972
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,490
<font color="yellow">You have to tell the truth.</font>

973
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,630
<font color="yellow">I can't prepare it when you're leaving for school now.</font>

974
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,230
<font color="yellow">You're in the fifth grade. You should know by now.</font>

975
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,090
<font color="yellow">You should prepare your own school supplies.</font>

976
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking her for it?</font>

977
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,830
<font color="yellow">You're in the fifth grade so you should be able to do it!</font>

978
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,590
<font color="yellow">And did you and Da Rong bully Ddol Ee?</font>

979
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:50,890
<font color="yellow">I didn't!</font>

980
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,230
<font color="yellow">I told you to take care of him like your own brother!</font>

981
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,530
<font color="yellow">You're a kid but you should know how things work in this household!</font>

982
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,930
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling at me?</font>

983
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,660
<font color="yellow">Work stresses me out enough.</font>

984
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,830
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel sorry for me?</font>

985
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,660
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you get punished at school!</font>

986
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,860
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting this way, Jae Soon?</font>

987
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,490
<font color="yellow">Tell me why you've been doing this since yesterday.</font>

988
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,630
<font color="yellow">You went out without picking up Da Rong from kindergarten...</font>

989
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,060
<font color="yellow">and you didn't do any housekeeping or take care of the girls.</font>

990
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:34,930
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

991
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,860
<font color="yellow">I went to the amusement park. Is that such a big problem?</font>

992
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,260
<font color="yellow">"Why did you two go alone?"</font>

993
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:45,130
<font color="yellow">"Let's go together next time." Can't you say something like that?</font>

994
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,760
<font color="yellow">He was envious of Cho Rong and Da Rong...</font>

995
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,890
<font color="yellow">so I took Ddol Ee to the amusement park.</font>

996
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:53,490
<font color="yellow">This is not about the amusement park.</font>

997
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,560
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is not happy these days.</font>

998
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:59,260
<font color="yellow">You don't know how Cho Rong treats him, right?</font>

999
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,030
<font color="yellow">She teams up with Da Rong and bullies him.</font>

1000
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,530
<font color="yellow">She steals his toys, too.</font>

1001
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,560
<font color="yellow">She does this every day.</font>

1002
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,960
<font color="yellow">- He even... - I took your side.</font>

1003
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,760
<font color="yellow">I scolded Cho Rong.</font>

1004
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,730
<font color="yellow">You pretended like you were on my side.</font>

1005
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,330
<font color="yellow">I pretended?</font>

1006
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,460
<font color="yellow">I'm trying my best, too.</font>

1007
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,760
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

1008
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,660
<font color="yellow">let's not take our own kids' sides.</font>

1009
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:29,360
<font color="yellow">It's good for nothing if I side with my girls and you side with Ddol Ee.</font>

1010
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,030
<font color="yellow">I'll watch myself from now on. I expect the same from you.</font>

1011
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:37,530
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, let me ask you a favour.</font>

1012
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:41,130
<font color="yellow">Don't keep things inside and explode all at once.</font>

1013
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,290
<font color="yellow">Tell me right away.</font>

1014
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:46,990
<font color="yellow">If you don't say anything and explode, I can't handle it.</font>

1015
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,160
<font color="yellow">You're...</font>

1016
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,430
<font color="yellow">speaking formally to me again.</font>

1017
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,030
<font color="yellow">Regardless of how much I try,</font>

1018
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,060
<font color="yellow">I can't tear down the wall between us.</font>

1019
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,230
<font color="yellow">What do you think the problem is?</font>

1020
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:12,530
<font color="yellow">- Do Geon Ho? - Here.</font>

1021
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,690
<font color="yellow">- Jang Da Rae. - Here.</font>

1022
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
<font color="yellow">Jo Cho Rong.</font>

1023
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,730
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>
