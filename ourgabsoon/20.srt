00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:07,265
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

2
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:11,565
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

3
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:16,465
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

4
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:30,635
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

5
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,495
<font color="yellow">Mum, why is your phone turned off?</font>

6
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:34,935
<font color="yellow">I didn't turn it off. What's going on?</font>

7
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:36,765
<font color="yellow">Dad disappeared.</font>

8
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:40,065
<font color="yellow">- What? - I woke up and Dad is gone.</font>

9
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,695
<font color="yellow">He's not at the beach nor at the dock.</font>

10
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:44,565
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

11
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:46,395
<font color="yellow">Where could he be?</font>

12
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:48,795
<font color="yellow">What were you doing?</font>

13
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,595
<font color="yellow">How could you not know where your dad went?</font>

14
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:55,235
<font color="yellow">How could you fall asleep when you are supposed to look for your dad?</font>

15
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:56,565
<font color="yellow">How could you sleep?</font>

16
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:58,235
<font color="yellow">Find him quick.</font>

17
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:01,035
<font color="yellow">I can't live if something happens to him.</font>

18
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:03,265
<font color="yellow">Find him now.</font>

19
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:07,565
<font color="yellow">Don't regret this.</font>

20
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:11,435
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon! Mal Nyeon!</font>

21
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:19,595
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

22
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:47,865
<font color="yellow">Why aren't they open yet?</font>

23
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:52,465
<font color="yellow">Hello. We want to buy tickets.</font>

24
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,465
<font color="yellow">It's not time yet.</font>

25
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,765
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, we're at the bus terminal.</font>

26
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:01,295
<font color="yellow">I'll set off in a minute.</font>

27
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,165
<font color="yellow">After I send the kids off to school.</font>

28
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:06,135
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, look after Mum.</font>

29
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:08,065
<font color="yellow">Call me if something happens.</font>

30
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:18,935
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

31
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:52,695
<font color="yellow">You were here.</font>

32
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:54,665
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

33
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,795
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you think I might have killed myself?</font>

34
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,065
<font color="yellow">My dad...</font>

35
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:06,295
<font color="yellow">never let me near the ocean.</font>

36
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:07,535
<font color="yellow">He was scared I might sail off.</font>

37
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:09,965
<font color="yellow">My dad...</font>

38
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:13,535
<font color="yellow">always looked down on himself for being a fisherman.</font>

39
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,695
<font color="yellow">He never let me play near the dock.</font>

40
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,935
<font color="yellow">Nor would he let me on the boat.</font>

41
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,535
<font color="yellow">Thanks to him, I was able to leave the ocean early.</font>

42
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:28,535
<font color="yellow">I used to come here often when I was young.</font>

43
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:32,865
<font color="yellow">I had big dreams and was never looked down on.</font>

44
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:36,795
<font color="yellow">I never knew...</font>

45
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,865
<font color="yellow">I would stand here so shabby...</font>

46
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:42,765
<font color="yellow">like this 50 years later.</font>

47
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:46,795
<font color="yellow">I thought I would age into an impressive old man.</font>

48
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:51,965
<font color="yellow">I struggled my whole life to make ends meet.</font>

49
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:55,565
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking how it would have been if I had become a fisherman.</font>

50
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:00,065
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have become...</font>

51
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:04,265
<font color="yellow">this useless retired man looking for junk.</font>

52
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:07,695
<font color="yellow">You lived a great life no matter what others say.</font>

53
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:11,465
<font color="yellow">You did everything you could for us.</font>

54
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:14,035
<font color="yellow">You did your best.</font>

55
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:19,135
<font color="yellow">We all know what you went through.</font>

56
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:24,695
<font color="yellow">Your golden time has not yet begun.</font>

57
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,565
<font color="yellow">You're only 63 years old.</font>

58
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,535
<font color="yellow">You're still young.</font>

59
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:33,665
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this as a doctor.</font>

60
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,435
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

61
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,035
<font color="yellow">I can start something at this age?</font>

62
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:40,165
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

63
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:41,935
<font color="yellow">You're still young.</font>

64
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:45,335
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

65
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:49,065
<font color="yellow">It's nice to hear.</font>

<font color="yellow">(From Seoul to Sokcho)</font>

67
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,865
<font color="yellow">When are you going to leave? I'm in a hurry.</font>

68
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,435
<font color="yellow">We'll set off when it's time.</font>

69
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,365
<font color="yellow">There are times when men want to cry.</font>

70
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,035
<font color="yellow">Though people say men shouldn't show their weakness.</font>

71
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:20,595
<font color="yellow">Are men supposed to be good...</font>

72
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,565
<font color="yellow">at everything and scared of nothing?</font>

73
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:29,265
<font color="yellow">There are times when I want to quit everything and run away.</font>

74
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,865
<font color="yellow">Cry if you want to cry.</font>

75
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:33,665
<font color="yellow">Don't hold it back just because you're a man.</font>

76
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,065
<font color="yellow">Did I ever tell you about my dream?</font>

77
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,365
<font color="yellow">Fisherman?</font>

78
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,065
<font color="yellow">Being a doctor is quite...</font>

79
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,665
<font color="yellow">a valuable and rewarding occupation.</font>

80
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:48,165
<font color="yellow">You can both help others out while making a living.</font>

81
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,065
<font color="yellow">Think of the lives you saved.</font>

82
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,235
<font color="yellow">There are lives that I couldn't save.</font>

83
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,165
<font color="yellow">The lives that I couldn't hold back.</font>

84
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:59,135
<font color="yellow">That's the way of Nature.</font>

85
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:01,765
<font color="yellow">You're still great.</font>

86
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,065
<font color="yellow">I wanted to become a doctor.</font>

87
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:10,165
<font color="yellow">Your grandfather told me to become a doctor instead of a fisherman.</font>

88
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:16,465
<font color="yellow">If I was good in school like you, I might have become a doctor.</font>

89
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,335
<font color="yellow">Did you worry about me?</font>

90
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:26,565
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

91
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,695
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Mum.</font>

92
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:30,665
<font color="yellow">Leave it.</font>

93
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,535
<font color="yellow">She'll be glad. She might be looking for the insurance policy.</font>

94
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:34,935
<font color="yellow">She won't.</font>

95
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:38,065
<font color="yellow">She told me that she'll be coming right away in tears.</font>

96
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:47,235
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

97
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:51,295
<font color="yellow">Did you find him? Is he alive?</font>

98
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,665
<font color="yellow">All right. That's fine. It's enough that he's alive.</font>

99
00:06:58,765 --> 00:06:59,865
<font color="yellow">I'll hand the phone over.</font>

100
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,435
<font color="yellow">- Don't. - There's no need.</font>

101
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,595
<font color="yellow">I'll go back home. Let's talk later.</font>

102
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:11,795
<font color="yellow">Stop. Stop the bus.</font>

103
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,335
<font color="yellow">Please stop the bus.</font>

104
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:22,765
<font color="yellow">Too bad for you that my brother's alive.</font>

105
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:25,135
<font color="yellow">I thought you said that you're most envious of a woman that lives...</font>

106
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,535
<font color="yellow">alone without a husband that you need to make food for.</font>

107
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,535
<font color="yellow">I have no pension.</font>

108
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,065
<font color="yellow">Don't you have life insurance?</font>

109
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:38,035
<font color="yellow">My goodness. She was terrified that she would become a widow.</font>

110
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,495
<font color="yellow">Make sure to eat well and don't do anything dangerous.</font>

111
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:51,295
<font color="yellow">If you do that all of a sudden, you might hurt yourself.</font>

112
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,165
<font color="yellow">Promise me.</font>

113
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,435
<font color="yellow">Set off now. Drive safe.</font>

114
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,295
<font color="yellow">My golden time is over.</font>

115
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:51,535
<font color="yellow">I'm a piece of rubbish waiting to be incinerated.</font>

116
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,505
<font color="yellow">What will I do until I become 100?</font>

117
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:59,465
<font color="yellow">There are times when I want to quit everything and run away.</font>

118
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:03,165
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, cry if you want to cry.</font>

119
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:05,235
<font color="yellow">Don't hold it back just because you're a man.</font>

120
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:01,065
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

121
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,335
<font color="yellow">- Where's Dad? - Didn't he come with you?</font>

122
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:07,165
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Se Gye.</font>

123
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,795
<font color="yellow">He never thinks of others.</font>

124
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,565
<font color="yellow">He's so selfish.</font>

125
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:14,695
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry. Have you eaten yet?</font>

126
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:16,765
<font color="yellow">How's Dad?</font>

127
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,335
<font color="yellow">Won't he come back?</font>

128
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:31,695
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

129
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,965
<font color="yellow">When Dad comes back, apologise for throwing out his stuff first.</font>

130
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,965
<font color="yellow">- What? - It's not just rubbish.</font>

131
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,935
<font color="yellow">Have you thought about how he must have felt after he retired?</font>

132
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,295
<font color="yellow">He had nowhere to go.</font>

133
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:48,065
<font color="yellow">He didn't lay it out around the house. It was only that one room.</font>

134
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,635
<font color="yellow">You could have let him have that.</font>

135
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:53,035
<font color="yellow">It's true. What he says is all true.</font>

136
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,335
<font color="yellow">It's not only Mum. It includes us all.</font>

137
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:59,295
<font color="yellow">He always said he had nowhere to go every morning,</font>

138
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:01,735
<font color="yellow">but none of us listened to him.</font>

139
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:04,935
<font color="yellow">Of all occasion, when he wasn't at home...</font>

140
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:08,165
<font color="yellow">Don't you see what's more important?</font>

141
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,665
<font color="yellow">Did your dad say that?</font>

142
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:13,265
<font color="yellow">He doesn't remember everything good I did for him.</font>

143
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,565
<font color="yellow">He's upset that I threw away his junk?</font>

144
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,235
<font color="yellow">You were hard on him.</font>

145
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:19,995
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

146
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:23,035
<font color="yellow">After he retired, you kept saying how he should be careful of himself.</font>

147
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:25,295
<font color="yellow">When he asked for food, you said you couldn't be bothered to.</font>

148
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,065
<font color="yellow">You would clank the dishes on the table.</font>

149
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,835
<font color="yellow">You told him off for dropping food even before he started eating.</font>

150
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,435
<font color="yellow">Even though this is his home,</font>

151
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:35,065
<font color="yellow">he didn't feel comfortable so he stayed in the playground many times.</font>

152
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,465
<font color="yellow">Why would he have slept on the sofa and not in the bedroom?</font>

153
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:41,035
<font color="yellow">He said he couldn't stand my snoring.</font>

154
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:42,695
<font color="yellow">Dad said he wanted to die.</font>

156
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,365
<font color="yellow">He regrets about his severance pay.</font>

157
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:53,835
<font color="yellow">He wants to die because he can't act as the breadwinner.</font>

158
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:56,365
<font color="yellow">He went to Han River a few times,</font>

159
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,195
<font color="yellow">but he couldn't jump because of us.</font>

160
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:03,635
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

161
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,065
<font color="yellow">Dad's lonely.</font>

162
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,065
<font color="yellow">Don't be too hard on him, Mum.</font>

163
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,995
<font color="yellow">He's right, Mum.</font>

164
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,465
<font color="yellow">Let Dad do what he wants.</font>

165
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:15,465
<font color="yellow">He went through a hard time.</font>

166
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,295
<font color="yellow">We were wrong.</font>

167
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,195
<font color="yellow">We made him lonely.</font>

168
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:21,695
<font color="yellow">Why are you all like this?</font>

169
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:24,465
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that I'm having a hard time as well?</font>

170
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:26,465
<font color="yellow">Is he the only lonely person?</font>

171
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:29,095
<font color="yellow">I don't need you kids.</font>

172
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,435
<font color="yellow">How could you all be on his side?</font>

173
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,195
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I feel?</font>

174
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,065
<font color="yellow">I'm always the one to blame.</font>

175
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:00,765
<font color="yellow">Water.</font>

176
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,065
<font color="yellow">I don't need the handkerchief.</font>

177
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:16,535
<font color="yellow">Didn't you spill any?</font>

178
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:18,235
<font color="yellow">I'm not a baby.</font>

179
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:22,635
<font color="yellow">Buy two of that.</font>

180
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:26,135
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to eat that?</font>

181
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:29,195
<font color="yellow">I hate eating those kind of things on the streets.</font>

182
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,765
<font color="yellow">It's so childish.</font>

183
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:31,965
<font color="yellow">I told you I want it.</font>

184
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,765
<font color="yellow">I said I don't eat this.</font>

185
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:51,035
<font color="yellow">- Relief Patch. - Yes?</font>

186
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:52,635
<font color="yellow">I thought you didn't want to eat it?</font>

187
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:54,665
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo!</font>

188
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:56,665
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo!</font>

189
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,995
<font color="yellow">It is tasty, though.</font>

190
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:09,235
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

191
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:12,695
<font color="yellow">Why did you come home so late? Mum's angry.</font>

192
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,635
<font color="yellow">What did you do till this time?</font>

193
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:16,965
<font color="yellow">It's not like you became a doctor by fooling around.</font>

194
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,365
<font color="yellow">Is it all right to take days off like this?</font>

195
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:20,995
<font color="yellow">I got permission from the hospital.</font>

196
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,665
<font color="yellow">Since it was the wedding of my professor's son.</font>

197
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:25,365
<font color="yellow">What kind of a wedding takes three days?</font>

198
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:26,835
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go on a trip?</font>

199
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:28,465
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm joking?</font>

200
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:31,995
<font color="yellow">- No. - Did that woman doctor go with you?</font>

201
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:34,665
<font color="yellow">She must have. She went to the same school.</font>

202
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:35,965
<font color="yellow">She didn't.</font>

203
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:38,035
<font color="yellow">It's obvious. She must have.</font>

204
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:40,435
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

205
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,365
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm back.</font>

206
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:44,865
<font color="yellow">Be careful what you do.</font>

207
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,135
<font color="yellow">Don't you do everything at your whim.</font>

208
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,165
<font color="yellow">Don't forget whose son-in-law you are.</font>

209
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:52,565
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

210
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:55,735
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going? - Where are you headed?</font>

211
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:58,465
<font color="yellow">To the hospital.</font>

212
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:00,765
<font color="yellow">I'll be going then.</font>

213
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:07,095
<font color="yellow">My goodness. That was unnecessary.</font>

214
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:08,265
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

215
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,535
<font color="yellow">Why do you always get irritated at what Relief Patch says?</font>

216
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:13,565
<font color="yellow">Dad. I need to scold her.</font>

217
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:15,365
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me off in front of others.</font>

218
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:18,565
<font color="yellow">That's why she looks down on me and behaves like that.</font>

219
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:22,365
<font color="yellow">You're the mighty person that pays my salary. I don't look down on you.</font>

220
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,695
<font color="yellow">I felt as if it could happen to me as I'm a mother of a son.</font>

221
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,765
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

222
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:31,235
<font color="yellow">How can you dream of marrying your son off to a rich family like us?</font>

223
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,435
<font color="yellow">Dream on.</font>

224

<font color="yellow">Even if I'm penniless,</font>

225

226
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,865
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me! - All right.</font>

227
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,335
<font color="yellow">Call me ma'am.</font>

228
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:44,565
<font color="yellow">Dad, say something. She won't listen to me.</font>

229
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:46,335
<font color="yellow">What you're saying is nonsense.</font>

230
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,165
<font color="yellow">I don't like her nor Se Gye.</font>

231
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,135
<font color="yellow">There's nothing you can do.</font>

232
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,635
<font color="yellow">He's like a son.</font>

233
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,765
<font color="yellow">If you don't have a son, be quiet.</font>

234
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,665
<font color="yellow">You must have felt sad.</font>

235
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,265
<font color="yellow">I didn't know.</font>

236
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,435
<font color="yellow">Dad was going through such a tough time.</font>

237
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:24,895
<font color="yellow">It never occurred to me.</font>

238
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,335
<font color="yellow">I see why people say that sons are always on their dad's side.</font>

<font color="yellow">My mum was upset about that.</font>

240

241
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,295

<font color="yellow">- What is it? - Just a spam text message.</font>

308
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:21,835
<font color="yellow">We should start saving money for our dates again.</font>

309
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,735
<font color="yellow">- How about 100 dollars per month? - Okay.</font>

310
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:25,635
<font color="yellow">How did you do on the exam?</font>

311
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:27,395
<font color="yellow">A beat-up car wouldn't have done well.</font>

312
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:30,065
<font color="yellow">- A beat-up car? - You called me a beat-up car.</font>

313
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:32,395
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

314
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:35,065
<font color="yellow">I always didn't make the cut-off score,</font>

315
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:36,635
<font color="yellow">but I was confident this time.</font>

316
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,895
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't called me that, I would've easily passed.</font>

317
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,465
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about one question.</font>

318
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:45,265
<font color="yellow">You'll pass. I'll pray for it.</font>

319
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:47,665
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

320
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:01,635
<font color="yellow">You have another one at home, right?</font>

321
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:03,765
<font color="yellow">What? Yes.</font>

322
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:07,865
<font color="yellow">They're not expensive, but they looked so pretty on you.</font>

323
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:30,165
<font color="yellow">Earrings are no good if it's not a pair. Just like us.</font>

324
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:58,195
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

325
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:02,665
<font color="yellow">You had it yesterday. You ate it instead of your brother.</font>

326
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:08,135
<font color="yellow">You know Joong Nyeon and I are crazy about raw fish.</font>

327
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:10,965
<font color="yellow">We often had raw fish when we were little,</font>

328
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:14,895
<font color="yellow">but we couldn't eat it after we moved. We've missed it so much.</font>

329
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:18,535
<font color="yellow">You should've bought some more.</font>

330
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,935
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be so petty.</font>

331
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:24,095
<font color="yellow">I had been so generous since I was young.</font>

332
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,535
<font color="yellow">People told me that I shouldn't be so generous...</font>

333
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:29,195
<font color="yellow">when I have no money.</font>

334
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:32,395
<font color="yellow">Everyone knew how generous I was.</font>

335
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:34,695
<font color="yellow">But thanks to your incompetent brother,</font>

336
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:38,835
<font color="yellow">I became so petty and narrow-minded.</font>

337
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:42,735
<font color="yellow">To sum up, girls should marry a competent man.</font>

338
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:44,735
<font color="yellow">No one can beat you in arguments.</font>

339
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,895
<font color="yellow">Did you also win a speech contest when you were young?</font>

340
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:56,735
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

341
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,265
<font color="yellow">I picked them up myself.</font>

342
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:03,395
<font color="yellow">He's being a baby about it. I should calm him down with these.</font>

343
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:06,935
<font color="yellow">Why is he becoming so weak as he gets old?</font>

344
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:09,635
<font color="yellow">It's not charming at all.</font>

345
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:13,235
<font color="yellow">You think he's not charming after all these years?</font>

346
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:16,735
<font color="yellow">The things I picked up were much more than that.</font>

347
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:19,635
<font color="yellow">That's not enough to make him happy.</font>

348
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:24,195
<font color="yellow">"Now that your husband is not picking up the trash, you are."</font>

349
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,235
<font color="yellow">That's what someone else would say.</font>

350
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:16,865
<font color="yellow">- Dad! - Joong Nyeon! Gosh.</font>

351
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:19,665
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, Joong Nyeon. - What's the matter?</font>

352
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:24,135
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I feel like our late father came back to life.</font>

353
00:25:24,765 --> 00:25:27,335
<font color="yellow">I've been watching the news all day.</font>

354
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:29,935
<font color="yellow">I was afraid that you'd be on the news.</font>

355
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,095
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't know how anxious I was.</font>

356
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:34,765
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

357
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:40,565
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

358
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:44,235
<font color="yellow">How silly.</font>

359
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,365
<font color="yellow">Do you feel better now that you made everyone worry?</font>

360
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:49,695
<font color="yellow">They were all so upset.</font>

361
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:51,765
<font color="yellow">I prepared your meal. Go and eat.</font>

362
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:54,965
<font color="yellow">You should eat. She got you raw fish.</font>

363
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,695
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to eat it, forget it.</font>

364
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:16,535
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I was so worried about him.</font>

365
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:19,565
<font color="yellow">I was crazy to spend money...</font>

366
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:22,635
<font color="yellow">to prepare all this. He doesn't even care.</font>

367
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:25,995
<font color="yellow">I resent that this is my life. No one understands me.</font>

368
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:27,765
<font color="yellow">Husbands and children are all useless.</font>

369
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:29,265
<font color="yellow">- Se Gye. - Did Dad call you, too?</font>

370
00:27:29,635 --> 00:27:31,495
<font color="yellow">Yes. He called Jae Soon as well.</font>

371
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:34,165
<font color="yellow">What can it be? Why did he want to meet us outside?</font>

372
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:36,235
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. Let's go in.</font>

373
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,665
<font color="yellow">Tell me about the things you want.</font>

374
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:55,495
<font color="yellow">The things I can do for you. I don't have any assets to leave you,</font>

375
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:57,735
<font color="yellow">so don't ask for money.</font>

376
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:02,195
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

377
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:07,035
<font color="yellow">You'd feel better if you register Ddol Ee as Geum Sik's son, right?</font>

378
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:09,365
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

379
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:12,565
<font color="yellow">What about you, Se Gye?</font>

380
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,695
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly asking us this?</font>

381
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,435
<font color="yellow">Dad. Is something wrong?</font>

382
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:19,535
<font color="yellow">Nothing's wrong.</font>

383
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:24,735
<font color="yellow">I realised I haven't done much for you. I just want to do what I can.</font>

384
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:27,895
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

385
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,435
<font color="yellow">There is nothing I want.</font>

386
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:33,695
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

387
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:36,095
<font color="yellow">You want to get married this year, right?</font>

388
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,035
<font color="yellow">No, Dad.</font>

389
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:39,865
<font color="yellow">You said your boyfriend will visit us soon.</font>

390
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,095
<font color="yellow">He's a jerk.</font>

391
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:46,895
<font color="yellow">He just played with Gab Soon for sport.</font>

392
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:49,565
<font color="yellow">What is she talking about?</font>

393
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,765
<font color="yellow">You're a smart kid.</font>

394
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:01,035
<font color="yellow">You must've fallen for him because of the money.</font>

395
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:03,995
<font color="yellow">If we were well-off,</font>

396
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:07,035
<font color="yellow">he wouldn't have treated you that way.</font>

397
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:09,995
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

398
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:13,965
<font color="yellow">I didn't know I had such a bad taste in men.</font>

399
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:15,665
<font color="yellow">I admit it.</font>

400
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:20,365
<font color="yellow">I know I broke you and Mum's heart.</font>

401
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:23,235
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

402
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:25,835
<font color="yellow">Don't be hard on yourself.</font>

403
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,695
<font color="yellow">You've never dated anyone who drives an imported car,</font>

404
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,365
<font color="yellow">and buys you nice meals like him.</font>

405
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:33,995
<font color="yellow">It can make you go crazy.</font>

406
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:35,765
<font color="yellow">I understand that.</font>

407
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:41,295
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Don't say that.</font>

408
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:46,295
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that we couldn't raise you in a better environment.</font>

409
00:29:46,695 --> 00:29:50,195
<font color="yellow">I'm just a snob. It's not your fault.</font>

410
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:54,165
<font color="yellow">You didn't raise me, Jae Soon or Se Gye poorly.</font>

411
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:56,995
<font color="yellow">Just forget about him.</font>

412
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:02,195
<font color="yellow">You'll meet someone better.</font>

413
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:07,235
<font color="yellow">Dad. I'm sorry I didn't try to understand how you feel.</font>

414
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:11,265
<font color="yellow">When Se Gye told me, I felt so terrible.</font>

415
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,235
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon felt bad, too.</font>

416
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:16,595
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

417
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:19,035
<font color="yellow">Rely on us.</font>

418
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:21,735
<font color="yellow">We have your back.</font>

419
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:25,295
<font color="yellow">Don't ever say that you want to die.</font>

420
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:28,495
<font color="yellow">Don't feel lonely.</font>

421
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,895
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't.</font>

422
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:35,665
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't.</font>

423
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:45,635
<font color="yellow">I heard you and the kids had a talk.</font>

424
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:50,035
<font color="yellow">You may be thinking about leaving after doing nice things for them.</font>

425
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:53,235
<font color="yellow">What about me? What would I do without you?</font>

426
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,065
<font color="yellow">What's the thing that you want?</font>

427
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,935
<font color="yellow">Tell me one thing.</font>

428
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:00,065
<font color="yellow">If I can do it for you, I will.</font>

429
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,235
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

430
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,765
<font color="yellow">I can't be apart from you.</font>

431
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:13,065
<font color="yellow">I'll follow you anywhere you go.</font>

432
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:16,695
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

433
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:18,995
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking about dying?</font>

434
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:21,265
<font color="yellow">Even if I want to die, that's not up to me.</font>

435
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:23,865
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

436
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:27,865
<font color="yellow">I'll behave, so please don't leave me.</font>

437
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,565
<font color="yellow">Is Se Bang here?</font>

438
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,735
<font color="yellow">The girls are coming over today, right?</font>

439
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:40,365
<font color="yellow">Yes. They'll come later.</font>

440
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,035
<font color="yellow">Ask Geum Sik what he wants to eat.</font>

441
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:46,465
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Do you have to ask?</font>

442
00:31:46,565 --> 00:31:48,435
<font color="yellow">I want to cook for him when he comes.</font>

443
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:50,395
<font color="yellow">It's your day off. Just take a rest.</font>

444
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:51,865
<font color="yellow">We'll order in Chinese food.</font>

445
00:31:52,195 --> 00:31:53,765
<font color="yellow">That's not good enough.</font>

446
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,235
<font color="yellow">Call him and tell him to come.</font>

447
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:57,295
<font color="yellow">If you miss him that much, call him yourself.</font>

448
00:31:57,935 --> 00:31:59,235
<font color="yellow">Look at you talk.</font>

449
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:15,765
<font color="yellow">It's Mother. I mean Da Hae's mother. Should I not answer it?</font>

450
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,195
<font color="yellow">You should answer.</font>

451
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:21,765
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Geum Sik.</font>

452
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:24,595
<font color="yellow">You remember that the girls are coming over today, right?</font>

453
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:27,035
<font color="yellow">They're getting a piano lesson, so I'll drop them off later.</font>

454
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:30,535
<font color="yellow">I'll make spicy crab soup, your favourite. I'll see you soon.</font>

455
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:32,395
<font color="yellow">I should go grocery shopping.</font>

456
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:35,635
<font color="yellow">Change into something less revealing.</font>

457
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,165
<font color="yellow">What's with that makeup?</font>

458
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:40,565
<font color="yellow">- What? - Don't wear that lipstick.</font>

459
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:42,765
<font color="yellow">You know Geum Sik hates it.</font>

460
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,335
<font color="yellow">Don't wear glitter clothes like this.</font>

461
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:49,495
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to buy such short skirts?</font>

462
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:51,395
<font color="yellow">Buy something better.</font>

463
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,565
<font color="yellow">This is good enough.</font>

464
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,065
<font color="yellow">A Young.</font>

465
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:23,735
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - Come out.</font>

466
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:27,335
<font color="yellow">You're free today, right?</font>

467
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,595
<font color="yellow">Drop Cho Rong and Da Rong off at Da Hae's.</font>

468
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:31,895
<font color="yellow">I don't want to. You should do it.</font>

469
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,735
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't need wedding gifts.</font>

470
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:37,195
<font color="yellow">I can keep my money then.</font>

471
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:39,465
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

472
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:41,995
<font color="yellow">If you want the wedding gifts, do as I say.</font>

473
00:33:42,495 --> 00:33:44,435
<font color="yellow">They're taking a piano lesson. Go and pick them up.</font>

474
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:49,135
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

475
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,765
<font color="yellow">Hey! Stop.</font>

476
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:53,965
<font color="yellow">- Don't. - Gosh, A Young.</font>

477
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,135
<font color="yellow">Turn the water off.</font>

478
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:57,735
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

479
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:00,895
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - A Young.</font>

480
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:08,095
<font color="yellow">How do I look?</font>

481
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:10,665
<font color="yellow">That's only a tracksuit.</font>

482
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,365
<font color="yellow">This is the only neat clothes I have.</font>

483
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,165
<font color="yellow">Call in sick today.</font>

484
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:17,765
<font color="yellow">You should spend some time together with Geum Sik and the girls.</font>

485
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:20,565
<font color="yellow">I have other people to spend time with.</font>

486
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:22,665
<font color="yellow">You're lucky I'm busy right now.</font>

487
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:24,565
<font color="yellow">Do it before I spank you on the back.</font>

488
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:33,295
<font color="yellow">I can't come to work today.</font>

489
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:35,465
<font color="yellow">My house is on fire.</font>

490
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,635
<font color="yellow">Would that make you happy?</font>

491
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,365
<font color="yellow">Grow up, please.</font>

492
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,465
<font color="yellow">Don't look at me. That's annoying.</font>

493
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,105
<font color="yellow">I ignored her.</font>

494
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:05,865
<font color="yellow">We ran out of ramyeon.</font>

495
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,605
<font color="yellow">I don't want to buy it by the piece.</font>

496
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:14,105
<font color="yellow">Let's just buy a box.</font>

497
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:15,565
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

498
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:17,835
<font color="yellow">We're finally buying it by the box.</font>

499
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:19,765
<font color="yellow">Not everyone can buy ramyeon by the box.</font>

500
00:35:20,105 --> 00:35:22,835
<font color="yellow">We're getting into the high society step by step.</font>

501
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:24,665
<font color="yellow">Maybe someday we'll have food waste.</font>

502
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:28,235
<font color="yellow">People who take out food waste every day...</font>

503
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:29,765
<font color="yellow">must be so happy.</font>

504
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:32,435
<font color="yellow">They are blessed people.</font>

505
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,065
<font color="yellow">- Grandma! - Grandma!</font>

506
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:47,165
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my little ones. You're here.</font>

507
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:50,535
<font color="yellow">A Young, you came instead.</font>

508
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,765
<font color="yellow">- Where is your dad? - He's cleaning the house...</font>

509
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:54,265
<font color="yellow">and the front yard.</font>

510
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:57,065
<font color="yellow">I didn't know Geum Sik cleaned.</font>

511
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:59,565
<font color="yellow">I thought his wife is a full-time housewife.</font>

512
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:03,295
<font color="yellow">Why would she ask him to clean the house?</font>

513
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:04,465
<font color="yellow">What a selfish woman.</font>

514
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:05,735
<font color="yellow">Hello, my daughters.</font>

515
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:09,835
<font color="yellow">What time should I pick them up?</font>

516
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:10,995
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

517
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,865
<font color="yellow">I'll drop them off myself. Just go.</font>

518
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,165
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

519
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:16,835
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

520
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:19,695
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

521
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:23,435
<font color="yellow">They're my kids. Why would you thank me...</font>

522
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:24,995
<font color="yellow">for dropping them off?</font>

523
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:26,935
<font color="yellow">Stop nit-picking.</font>

524
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:29,695
<font color="yellow">I don't want to come here, and I don't want to see you.</font>

525
00:36:29,835 --> 00:36:31,865
<font color="yellow">I just came because Geum Sik asked me to.</font>

526
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:34,135
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Don't talk to Mum like that.</font>

527
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,365
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

528
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:37,565
<font color="yellow">Please drop them off later.</font>

529
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:38,965
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

530
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:42,195
<font color="yellow">A Young. I made spicy crab soup. Why don't you stay and have some?</font>

531
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:44,665
<font color="yellow">That witch. I should teach her a lesson.</font>

532
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,765
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You didn't do anything wrong.</font>

533
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,335
<font color="yellow">Why do you crawl to her?</font>

534
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:54,365
<font color="yellow">- What was that for? - I'm just frustrated.</font>

535
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,435
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have bought the crab.</font>

536
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:06,665
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

537
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:08,195
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

538
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:11,605
<font color="yellow">My mum worked hard to make you spicy crab soup.</font>

539
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,735
<font color="yellow">You should've at least called.</font>

540
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:15,935
<font color="yellow">Is sending A Young the best you could do?</font>

541
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:20,235
<font color="yellow">Tell her to watch her tongue. I won't stand it.</font>

542
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:22,265
<font color="yellow">I don't care. Do as you please.</font>

543
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:23,965
<font color="yellow">Your mother just assumed I'd come.</font>

544
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:26,865
<font color="yellow">- I never told her I would go. - Are you kidding me?</font>

545
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:28,265
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

546
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,065
<font color="yellow">Tell her I'm sorry. I'm hanging up.</font>

547
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,465
<font color="yellow">Her mother made spicy crab soup. She's mad that I didn't come.</font>

548
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:39,565
<font color="yellow">Do you want to eat spicy crab soup?</font>

549
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:42,165
<font color="yellow">I do like it, but I don't need to eat it.</font>

550
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:43,995
<font color="yellow">Let's go grocery shopping.</font>

551
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,895
<font color="yellow">I was going to go to the market anyway. Let's go.</font>

552
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:06,765
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here with a box of ramyeon?</font>

553
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:09,565
<font color="yellow">I thought you were someone else.</font>

554
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:10,935
<font color="yellow">Did your brother tell you?</font>

555
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:13,165
<font color="yellow">A child we support lives near here.</font>

556
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:15,465
<font color="yellow">I'm here to deliver ramyeon.</font>

557
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:18,965
<font color="yellow">I want them to feel comfortable,</font>

558
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,765
<font color="yellow">so I don't wear luxury clothes when I go to see them.</font>

559
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:23,335
<font color="yellow">That's the basic etiquette.</font>

560
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,165
<font color="yellow">I see. You could've ordered your subordinates to do it.</font>

561
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,295
<font color="yellow">This makes me feel good. I want to do it.</font>

562
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:31,065
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

563
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:35,035
<font color="yellow">I just met some people that are bad for my family.</font>

564
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,495
<font color="yellow">Seeing them puts me in a bad mood.</font>

565
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:41,865
<font color="yellow">I'm sure people who live here don't try hard to live better.</font>

566
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:45,235
<font color="yellow">You can't say that. They may have their own reasons.</font>

567
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,765
<font color="yellow">They may have tried, but failed.</font>

568
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:48,495
<font color="yellow">The people I just saw aren't like that.</font>

569
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,435
<font color="yellow">She's incompetent, but she only wears designer clothes...</font>

570
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,535
<font color="yellow">and takes deluxe taxis.</font>

571
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,995
<font color="yellow">She must have certain circumstances, too.</font>

572
00:38:56,765 --> 00:39:00,535
<font color="yellow">You said you'd like me even if I was a poor renter who only eats ramyeon.</font>

573
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,665
<font color="yellow">That's different. I can't even compare her to you.</font>

574
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:20,465
<font color="yellow">Eat it on your own. I have a date.</font>

575
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:24,335
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

576
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,265
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

577
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:30,365
<font color="yellow">You're not sick, are you?</font>

578
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:32,865
<font color="yellow">Poor people shouldn't get sick.</font>

579
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:34,235
<font color="yellow">I'm not sick.</font>

580
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:42,865
<font color="yellow">Only my heart aches.</font>

581
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:47,765
<font color="yellow">It's spicy crab soup.</font>

582
00:39:49,495 --> 00:39:51,495
<font color="yellow">- Here you go, Da Rong. - Look at you.</font>

583
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:54,865
<font color="yellow">You haven't tried this, right?</font>

584
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,165
<font color="yellow">Put some rice in it,</font>

585
00:39:58,135 --> 00:39:59,695
<font color="yellow">and mix it well.</font>

586
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:04,435
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

587
00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:08,635
<font color="yellow">Professor.</font>

588
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:11,335
<font color="yellow">Today is the last day of October.</font>

589
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:14,265
<font color="yellow">I somehow feel empty and lonely.</font>

590
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:17,735
<font color="yellow">I thought only poor people feel that way.</font>

591
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:21,435
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you see me,</font>

592
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:24,235
<font color="yellow">but I'm a very lonely woman.</font>

593
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:27,135
<font color="yellow">Everyone in this world is lonely.</font>

594
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:33,365
<font color="yellow">- I got it. - What do you mean?</font>

595
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:36,195
<font color="yellow">I got inspiration. For the poem, I mean.</font>

596
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:41,195
<font color="yellow">"I still remember"...</font>

597
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:43,935
<font color="yellow">"the last night of October."</font>

598
00:40:45,265 --> 00:40:47,465
<font color="yellow">"Leaving puzzling words behind,"</font>

599
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:49,835
<font color="yellow">"we said farewell to each other."</font>

600
00:40:50,735 --> 00:40:55,035
<font color="yellow">"Was that lonely face a reflection of how you felt?"</font>

601
00:40:55,695 --> 00:41:00,935
<font color="yellow">"Do I have to be forgotten without a word?"</font>

602
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:05,495
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

603
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:07,895
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

604
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:10,465
<font color="yellow">Have you heard of this poem before?</font>

605
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:13,765
<font color="yellow">No. I love the poem so much...</font>

606
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:15,765
<font color="yellow">that I can't walk.</font>

607
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:18,395
<font color="yellow">"Leaving puzzling words behind,"</font>

608
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,165
<font color="yellow">"we said farewell to each other."</font>

609
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:22,865
<font color="yellow">Where should I underline?</font>

610
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,435
<font color="yellow">It has a title.</font>

611
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:26,995
<font color="yellow">Underline "The last night of October".</font>

612
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:32,535
<font color="yellow">Professor, it's the last night of October...</font>

613
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:34,665
<font color="yellow">so let's go for a movie.</font>

614
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:53,105
<font color="yellow">Your salon is in a good location so you must have a lot of customers.</font>

615
00:41:53,295 --> 00:41:56,605
<font color="yellow">Come and perm your hair. I'll give you a special price.</font>

616
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,195
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

617
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:02,105
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

618
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:09,665
<font color="yellow">Do you watch movies here?</font>

619
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:13,435
<font color="yellow">It's for couples. You can lie down and watch the movie.</font>

620
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:15,835
<font color="yellow">- Here? - These are our seats.</font>

621
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:18,865
<font color="yellow">Lie down, Professor.</font>

622
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,265
<font color="yellow">I can't do this.</font>

623
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:26,735
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Lie down. It's comfortable.</font>

624
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:28,995
<font color="yellow">I'm getting scared.</font>

625
00:42:29,335 --> 00:42:30,465
<font color="yellow">Let me leave.</font>

626
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:35,965
<font color="yellow">Don't do this. Let go.</font>

627
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:37,605
<font color="yellow">Stay still, Professor.</font>

628
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:39,165
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

629
00:42:40,535 --> 00:42:42,935
<font color="yellow">It's not scary. Stay still.</font>

630
00:42:43,035 --> 00:42:44,435
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

631
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,465
<font color="yellow">Take care of what? Don't do this. You can't do this.</font>

632
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,765
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo, save me! I'm dying!</font>

633
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:52,865
<font color="yellow">Save me!</font>

634
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:56,465
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

635
00:43:10,395 --> 00:43:11,395
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

636
00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:16,535
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, wait for us.</font>

637
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:22,265
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

638
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,195
<font color="yellow">- Do you have something to say? - I don't.</font>

639
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:28,665
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like that, then?</font>

640
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,135
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

641
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:33,865
<font color="yellow">Can't you live with us?</font>

642
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:38,495
<font color="yellow">Live with Dad.</font>

643
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:42,165
<font color="yellow">It'll be better for you guys to live with him.</font>

644
00:43:42,465 --> 00:43:46,095
<font color="yellow">You can use as much money as you want and buy whatever you want.</font>

645
00:43:46,395 --> 00:43:48,765
<font color="yellow">You can live with Dad again.</font>

646
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:50,965
<font color="yellow">It's too late already.</font>

647
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:54,765
<font color="yellow">- You have Jae Soon. - They might break up.</font>

648
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:58,365
<font color="yellow">I'm okay,</font>

649
00:43:59,565 --> 00:44:01,565
<font color="yellow">but I want Da Rong to live with you.</font>

650
00:44:02,435 --> 00:44:04,535
<font color="yellow">Da Rong is still young so I feel bad for her.</font>

651
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:07,265
<font color="yellow">I told you already.</font>

652
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:11,395
<font color="yellow">Even if you were to live with me, I can't do anything for you.</font>

653
00:44:12,495 --> 00:44:15,965
<font color="yellow">Other kids are shrewd and they stick by the parent with more money.</font>

654
00:44:17,065 --> 00:44:18,165
<font color="yellow">What's up with you?</font>

655
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:20,495
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

656
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:35,335
<font color="yellow">It's me. You said you'll be at the playground. Where are you?</font>

657
00:44:37,295 --> 00:44:38,295
<font color="yellow">I'm almost here.</font>

658
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:41,895
<font color="yellow">I see you.</font>

659
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:58,935
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong and Da Rong, I'm leaving.</font>

660
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:05,065
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Mum. - Bye.</font>

661
00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:21,935
<font color="yellow">Did you eat good food?</font>

662
00:45:22,465 --> 00:45:23,495
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

663
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:30,295
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about her.</font>

664
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:39,765
<font color="yellow">This is our neighbourhood.</font>

665
00:45:40,565 --> 00:45:41,895
<font color="yellow">Nobody is looking.</font>

666
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:49,335
<font color="yellow">I almost died of withdrawal symptoms when I didn't see you.</font>

667
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:52,165
<font color="yellow">- Do you feel better now? - Yes.</font>

668
00:45:53,395 --> 00:45:54,495
<font color="yellow">You can go.</font>

669
00:45:56,595 --> 00:45:59,595
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to leave you. - Should I drop you off?</font>

670
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:03,065
<font color="yellow">We'll be up all night. This is the third time.</font>

671
00:46:03,435 --> 00:46:05,165
<font color="yellow">I know. I should leave.</font>

672
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:44,335
<font color="yellow">Once we save enough money, should we go somewhere overnight?</font>

673
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:46,165
<font color="yellow">I'll save up as fast as I can.</font>

674
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:49,335
<font color="yellow">My heart is pounding already.</font>

675
00:46:49,835 --> 00:46:50,895
<font color="yellow">Only my heart.</font>

676
00:46:51,295 --> 00:46:52,365
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

677
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:57,295
<font color="yellow">I'll see you in my dream.</font>

678
00:46:58,965 --> 00:47:00,095
<font color="yellow">I'll text you.</font>

679
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:03,365
<font color="yellow">- See you. - You, too.</font>

680
00:47:16,095 --> 00:47:17,435
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - What?</font>

681
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,695
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

682
00:47:20,895 --> 00:47:24,665
<font color="yellow">You were dumped by a guy so you should be crying your eyes out.</font>

683
00:47:24,895 --> 00:47:26,695
<font color="yellow">Why are you dancing around?</font>

684
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:29,065
<font color="yellow">I didn't get dumped. I dumped him.</font>

685
00:47:30,365 --> 00:47:31,735
<font color="yellow">How's Gab Dol doing?</font>

686
00:47:32,235 --> 00:47:34,565
<font color="yellow">I don't know. You don't know what you're talking about.</font>

687
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:41,735
<font color="yellow">Good luck trying to fool me. I've been through it all.</font>

688
00:47:41,935 --> 00:47:46,065
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

689
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:51,265
<font color="yellow">Hey, Soo Jo.</font>

690
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,195
<font color="yellow">You're in a good mood.</font>

691
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:56,265
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you. Thank you, Soo Jo.</font>

692
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:57,995
<font color="yellow">- Are things going well? - Yes.</font>

693
00:47:58,765 --> 00:48:01,495
<font color="yellow">- I'll go in first. - Hold on, Gab Dol.</font>

694
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:04,135
<font color="yellow">What's love?</font>

695
00:48:06,735 --> 00:48:07,835
<font color="yellow">Love?</font>

696
00:48:09,535 --> 00:48:11,635
<font color="yellow">You know better than me.</font>

697
00:48:13,395 --> 00:48:14,895
<font color="yellow">As you know,</font>

698
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,835
<font color="yellow">I've only dated Gab Soon seriously.</font>

699
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,295
<font color="yellow">Answer my question.</font>

700
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:21,595
<font color="yellow">It's hard to sum it up.</font>

701
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,195
<font color="yellow">Let's make this simple, then.</font>

702
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:25,435
<font color="yellow">What would you switch it with?</font>

703
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:28,265
<font color="yellow">- 10 portions of rib eye? - No.</font>

704
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:30,865
<font color="yellow">- A pair of luxury dress shoes? - No.</font>

705
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:31,965
<font color="yellow">A luxury car?</font>

706
00:48:34,265 --> 00:48:37,035
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you can switch it with,</font>

707
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:38,835
<font color="yellow">but one thing is for certain.</font>

708
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:43,965
<font color="yellow">If that person doesn't exist in this world, everything is useless.</font>

709
00:48:44,695 --> 00:48:47,965
<font color="yellow">Imagine this. It's a beautiful park.</font>

710
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:51,865
<font color="yellow">The cherry blossoms have bloomed...</font>

711
00:48:52,235 --> 00:48:54,635
<font color="yellow">and the background is green.</font>

712
00:48:55,365 --> 00:49:00,035
<font color="yellow">Flowers, butterflies, balloons and children.</font>

713
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:01,865
<font color="yellow">You can hear them giggle.</font>

714
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:06,735
<font color="yellow">Then, everything stops like a scene from a black-and-white movie.</font>

715
00:49:09,135 --> 00:49:13,235
<font color="yellow">The giggle stops and the screen turns black and white.</font>

716
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:15,395
<font color="yellow">That's how it is.</font>

717
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:17,995
<font color="yellow">That's what happens when that person disappears from your life.</font>

718
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:23,595
<font color="yellow">You don't want to eat. You have no joy.</font>

719
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:28,035
<font color="yellow">The world only shines when that person is around.</font>

720
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:31,395
<font color="yellow">Once you stop loving,</font>

721
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:34,495
<font color="yellow">it feels like the world is going to end with you.</font>

722
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:39,295
<font color="yellow">It's not like you've never been in love, right?</font>

723
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:40,995
<font color="yellow">You're getting married.</font>

724
00:49:54,635 --> 00:49:57,495
<font color="yellow">- A bottle of soju, please. - Okay.</font>

725
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:34,935
<font color="yellow">Are you worried about something?</font>

726
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:40,665
<font color="yellow">I'll give you advice. Spill it.</font>

727
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,435
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

728
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:51,595
<font color="yellow">How rude.</font>

729
00:50:52,335 --> 00:50:53,395
<font color="yellow">Move out!</font>

730
00:50:56,565 --> 00:50:58,095
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait for me.</font>

731
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:11,895
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo. Geum Soo Jo!</font>

732
00:52:13,265 --> 00:52:14,395
<font color="yellow">Come out, Soo Jo.</font>

733
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:22,665
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

734
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,165
<font color="yellow">What happened to these?</font>

735
00:52:25,365 --> 00:52:27,765
<font color="yellow">Who did this? We don't have dogs in this house.</font>

736
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:37,465
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you going there?</font>

737
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:41,695
<font color="yellow">I'm done with the bathroom.</font>

738
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:44,095
<font color="yellow">Buy me a new pair.</font>

739
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:45,835
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - What is it?</font>

740
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:48,065
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo's shoes were soaking in water.</font>

741
00:52:48,895 --> 00:52:49,965
<font color="yellow">Did you do that?</font>

742
00:52:50,495 --> 00:52:51,535
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

743
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,565
<font color="yellow">It sounds like she did.</font>

744
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,135
<font color="yellow">Why did you soak his shoes in water?</font>

745
00:52:55,335 --> 00:52:56,535
<font color="yellow">He was acting up.</font>

746
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:58,665
<font color="yellow">He gave me a piggyback ride so I was going to be nice.</font>

747
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:00,595
<font color="yellow">Who gave you a piggyback ride?</font>

748
00:53:00,765 --> 00:53:03,365
<font color="yellow">When I had to go to the hospital, he gave me a piggyback ride and ran.</font>

749
00:53:03,595 --> 00:53:05,495
<font color="yellow">If you act up again, I won't let it go.</font>

750
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,895
<font color="yellow">I never acted up.</font>

751
00:53:07,095 --> 00:53:09,695
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo never acts up.</font>

752
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:12,765
<font color="yellow">As I said, he's been trained at a young age to marry a rich girl.</font>

753
00:53:12,865 --> 00:53:16,035
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I'll pay for your shoes!</font>

754
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:18,035
<font color="yellow">Get me the same pair today.</font>

755
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:20,995
<font color="yellow">Why does she have to get a new pair?</font>

756
00:53:21,295 --> 00:53:23,335
<font color="yellow">You can dry these and wear them.</font>

757
00:53:23,435 --> 00:53:24,735
<font color="yellow">It's leather so you can't.</font>

758
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:27,765
<font color="yellow">It's been soaked in water all night so you can't turn it back.</font>

759
00:53:28,295 --> 00:53:30,495
<font color="yellow">So he can't wear them.</font>

760
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:31,935
<font color="yellow">How much are they?</font>

761
00:53:32,195 --> 00:53:33,765
<font color="yellow">The original price is 1,000 dollars...</font>

762
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:37,895
<font color="yellow">What kind of shoes cost 1,000 dollars?</font>

763
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:40,135
<font color="yellow">They're luxury shoes.</font>

764
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:42,195
<font color="yellow">He wears luxury shoes when he can't afford them.</font>

765
00:53:42,395 --> 00:53:45,635
<font color="yellow">They were posted on the internet as used for 700 dollars...</font>

766
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:48,335
<font color="yellow">so we met up with the person and begged.</font>

767
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:50,465
<font color="yellow">My dad talked to him nicely and convinced him...</font>

768
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:52,895
<font color="yellow">to sell them for 450 dollars. They were difficult to get.</font>

769
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:55,595
<font color="yellow">He's right. I can attest to that.</font>

770
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,535
<font color="yellow">He was adamant against giving me a discount...</font>

771
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:59,295
<font color="yellow">so I lied down on the ground...</font>

772
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:02,465
<font color="yellow">and did everything to get them. We poured in all our savings.</font>

773
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:04,335
<font color="yellow">Because of what happened that day,</font>

774
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:07,965
<font color="yellow">my body aches on gloomy days.</font>

775
00:54:08,065 --> 00:54:09,635
<font color="yellow">Just tell me what you need.</font>

776
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:11,295
<font color="yellow">Buy me the exact same pair.</font>

777
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:13,035
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Dad.</font>

778
00:54:16,895 --> 00:54:17,935
<font color="yellow">1,000 dollars?</font>

779
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:24,595
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

780
00:54:33,295 --> 00:54:34,765
<font color="yellow">Why are you all like this?</font>

781
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:37,665
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that I'm having a hard time as well?</font>

782
00:54:38,095 --> 00:54:39,635
<font color="yellow">Is he the only lonely person?</font>

783
00:54:40,395 --> 00:54:42,265
<font color="yellow">I don't need you kids.</font>

784
00:54:42,765 --> 00:54:44,495
<font color="yellow">How could you all be on his side?</font>

785
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:46,395
<font color="yellow">Do you know how I feel?</font>

786
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,065
<font color="yellow">I must be the bad person to you.</font>

787
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,435
<font color="yellow">- You're up. - What is it?</font>

788
00:55:01,595 --> 00:55:03,165
<font color="yellow">It's about sending money to my family.</font>

789
00:55:03,465 --> 00:55:06,095
<font color="yellow">Can't you transfer it to their bank account instead of meeting my mum?</font>

790
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:07,965
<font color="yellow">Did your mum say anything to you?</font>

791
00:55:09,295 --> 00:55:12,335
<font color="yellow">She doesn't feel comfortable. It must be uncomfortable for you, too.</font>

792
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:14,135
<font color="yellow">It's totally fine with me.</font>

793
00:55:15,265 --> 00:55:18,895
<font color="yellow">We should see each other at least once a month. We're a family.</font>

794
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:20,865
<font color="yellow">I'm going to see her next week.</font>

795
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:24,295
<font color="yellow">Get to work. Don't worry about that.</font>

796
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:26,295
<font color="yellow">Doctors shouldn't be worried about something so trivial.</font>

797
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:27,735
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

798
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:43,995
<font color="yellow">You need to get your money.</font>

799
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:47,195
<font color="yellow">Saturday at noon. Golden Hotel Lounge.</font>

800
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:49,095
<font color="yellow">Dress up nicely.</font>

801
00:55:49,295 --> 00:55:50,465
<font color="yellow">This woman.</font>

802
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:53,395
<font color="yellow">I told Se Gye to talk to her.</font>

803
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:04,435
<font color="yellow">Get on.</font>

804
00:56:27,695 --> 00:56:28,735
<font color="yellow">You got prettier.</font>

805
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:32,435
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I took care of all the other girls.</font>

806
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,735
<font color="yellow">You're pretty good.</font>

807
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,135
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep...</font>

808
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:42,265
<font color="yellow">the past few nights because of you.</font>

809
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,595
<font color="yellow">I've never been hit by a woman.</font>

810
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:52,465
<font color="yellow">I think of you when I see flowers.</font>

811
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:03,295
<font color="yellow">Let's...</font>

812
00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:05,935
<font color="yellow">go out.</font>

813
00:57:13,035 --> 00:57:14,195
<font color="yellow">Pick up my calls.</font>

814
00:57:15,995 --> 00:57:17,395
<font color="yellow">Text back right away.</font>

815
00:57:27,335 --> 00:57:29,695
<font color="yellow">Dal Tong put this together.</font>

816
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:31,135
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything to him.</font>

817
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,935
<font color="yellow">He's the reason we're together again.</font>

818
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,765
<font color="yellow">Here comes the couple!</font>

819
00:57:47,365 --> 00:57:49,765
<font color="yellow">See? You two look good together.</font>

820
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,435
<font color="yellow">We're even numbers now.</font>

821
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:54,465
<font color="yellow">If you break up again, we won't be your friends any more.</font>

822
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:56,135
<font color="yellow">Swear in front of us.</font>

823
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,295
<font color="yellow">I swear.</font>

824
00:57:59,865 --> 00:58:00,865
<font color="yellow">I swear.</font>

825
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:02,235
<font color="yellow">That's not enough.</font>

826
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,195
<font color="yellow">- I swear! - I swear!</font>

827
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:07,765
<font color="yellow">We're witnesses.</font>

828
00:58:08,095 --> 00:58:10,365
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever say anything about getting divorced again.</font>

829
00:58:10,465 --> 00:58:12,395
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take you to the family court next time.</font>

830
00:58:13,735 --> 00:58:15,295
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol</font>

831
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:19,535
<font color="yellow">- And Gab Soon lived in one village - And Gab Soon lived in one village</font>

832
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:23,835
<font color="yellow">The two of them loved each other</font>

833
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:29,165
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

834
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,095
<font color="yellow">- What is it, Honey? - Should we watch a movie tonight?</font>

835
00:58:41,635 --> 00:58:43,765
<font color="yellow">We can't leave the kids here and go to the theatre.</font>

836
00:58:43,865 --> 00:58:45,165
<font color="yellow">We can watch it at home.</font>

837
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:47,165
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take a break.</font>

838
00:58:47,865 --> 00:58:50,095
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll make good food.</font>

839
00:58:57,195 --> 00:58:59,065
<font color="yellow">Yes, Miss. What is it?</font>

840
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:02,135
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

841
00:59:09,065 --> 00:59:10,065
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

842
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:13,065
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

843
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:14,695
<font color="yellow">Are you a bully?</font>

844
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:16,495
<font color="yellow">Why did you hit your friend?</font>

845
00:59:17,735 --> 00:59:18,735
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

846
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:20,835
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - You're here.</font>

847
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:22,265
<font color="yellow">Are you his mum?</font>

848
00:59:22,365 --> 00:59:24,065
<font color="yellow">Look at my daughter's face.</font>

849
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:26,595
<font color="yellow">He scratched her. What are you going to do about it?</font>

850
00:59:26,765 --> 00:59:28,765
<font color="yellow">What if it leaves a mark on her face?</font>

851
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:31,735
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

852
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:35,295
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, say sorry.</font>

853
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:36,665
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

854
00:59:38,435 --> 00:59:40,695
<font color="yellow">My gosh. That looks painful.</font>

855
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:43,395
<font color="yellow">I'll scold Ddol Ee. I'm sorry.</font>

856
00:59:45,265 --> 00:59:46,565
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you for the treatment.</font>

857
00:59:46,665 --> 00:59:48,535
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem right now.</font>

858
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:52,465
<font color="yellow">What did you teach your child?</font>

859
00:59:53,695 --> 00:59:55,495
<font color="yellow">Maybe you set a bad example for him.</font>

860
00:59:56,435 --> 00:59:58,665
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't have a dad, you should have taken better care of him.</font>

861
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:01,565
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

862
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:03,335
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

863
01:00:06,695 --> 01:00:07,735
<font color="yellow">Counselling?</font>

864
01:00:08,365 --> 01:00:10,365
<font color="yellow">I think that would be a good idea.</font>

865
01:00:10,595 --> 01:00:13,695
<font color="yellow">He pushes girls and attacks them.</font>

866
01:00:14,035 --> 01:00:16,635
<font color="yellow">He only does that to girls his age.</font>

867
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:21,895
<font color="yellow">I've been his teacher for three years but it started this year.</font>

868
01:00:22,695 --> 01:00:24,935
<font color="yellow">You should get counselling for him.</font>

869
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:26,765
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

870
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:28,765
<font color="yellow">Okay, Miss.</font>

871
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:37,635
<font color="yellow">- Follow me. - Sure.</font>

872
01:00:44,995 --> 01:00:46,235
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

873
01:00:47,035 --> 01:00:48,395
<font color="yellow">When was that?</font>

874
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,095
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

875
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,695
<font color="yellow">I heard you came by a few days ago.</font>

876
01:00:53,935 --> 01:00:56,235
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, I was on a business trip at the time.</font>

877
01:01:16,565 --> 01:01:17,765
<font color="yellow">(Me, Mummy)</font>

878
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:23,695
<font color="yellow">How is Ddol Ee's condition?</font>

879
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:26,935
<font color="yellow">He received a psychological test.</font>

880
01:01:27,265 --> 01:01:29,865
<font color="yellow">He has a lot of anger inside.</font>

881
01:01:31,435 --> 01:01:32,495
<font color="yellow">He does?</font>

882
01:01:32,495 --> 01:01:36,235
<font color="yellow">He's releasing the anger caused by torment of his step-sisters...</font>

883
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:40,395
<font color="yellow">through violence on the girls his age at the nursery.</font>

884
01:01:41,895 --> 01:01:44,435
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a good relationship with his step-sisters, right?</font>

885
01:01:45,995 --> 01:01:47,695
<font color="yellow">They argue sometimes,</font>

886
01:01:48,295 --> 01:01:49,965
<font color="yellow">but they get along fairly well.</font>

887
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:52,035
<font color="yellow">That's only when you watch them.</font>

888
01:01:53,065 --> 01:01:56,735
<font color="yellow">Well, I thought that it's normal for kids to argue when they grow up.</font>

889
01:01:56,835 --> 01:01:58,565
<font color="yellow">Do not take this lightly.</font>

890
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:02,395
<font color="yellow">Even kids from same parents have issues.</font>

891
01:02:02,695 --> 01:02:04,665
<font color="yellow">This problem is not an ordinary issue.</font>

892
01:02:05,265 --> 01:02:08,495
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is pretending to be good and peaceful.</font>

893
01:02:08,595 --> 01:02:09,965
<font color="yellow">He's holding everything inside.</font>

894
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:12,265
<font color="yellow">He doesn't want to make you sad.</font>

895
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:14,465
<font color="yellow">You didn't know, did you?</font>

896
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:19,395
<font color="yellow">To Ddol Ee, you are his everything.</font>

897
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:24,135
<font color="yellow">He worries about you and loves you so much that...</font>

898
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:27,935
<font color="yellow">he doesn't show how he feels and is holding everything in.</font>

899
01:02:28,765 --> 01:02:32,295
<font color="yellow">It's too great of a burden for a seven-year-old to bear.</font>

900
01:02:33,535 --> 01:02:35,035
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it's gone on for so long.</font>

901
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,535
<font color="yellow">He needs treatments.</font>

902
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:50,295
<font color="yellow">Come quickly. I found a very funny movie.</font>

903
01:02:51,365 --> 01:02:52,965
<font color="yellow">Can we watch it some other time?</font>

904
01:02:53,765 --> 01:02:54,765
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

905
01:02:55,665 --> 01:02:59,765
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is not feeling well, so I want to sleep in his room.</font>

906
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,395
<font color="yellow">I think he has a fever.</font>

907
01:03:02,835 --> 01:03:04,595
<font color="yellow">Why does he have a fever? Did he catch a cold?</font>

908
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:08,465
<font color="yellow">It's not a cold, but I want to monitor him.</font>

909
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:22,735
<font color="yellow">A second marriage is tough even for adults.</font>

910
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:26,635
<font color="yellow">A seven-year-old would have had a tough time dealing with it.</font>

911
01:03:27,395 --> 01:03:30,765
<font color="yellow">He hid the stress he was getting from step-father and step-sisters...</font>

912
01:03:31,095 --> 01:03:34,395
<font color="yellow">from you because he didn't want you to worry.</font>
