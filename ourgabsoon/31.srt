<font color="yellow">Da Hae, you should take good care of sanitation.</font>

7

<font color="yellow">- You should clean up thoroughly. - Don't worry.</font>

<font color="yellow">It was a torture to make food just for others...</font>

65

74
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,140
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Do you still want to sell me off?</font>

80
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,640
<font color="yellow">Then go to a sauna and sleep comfortably.</font>

81
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,070
<font color="yellow">How can I sleep in a sauna? Think about my social position.</font>

82
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,140
<font color="yellow">Then go home.</font>

84
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,740
<font color="yellow">Do you want to follow me then?</font>

85
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,540
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a place to stay? - No. I mean my car.</font>

86
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,240
<font color="yellow">Forget it. This is all because of you.</font>

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,100
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you.</font>

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,700
<font color="yellow">I'll try to find the 100,000 dollars.</font>

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,170
<font color="yellow">How will you find that money? Just go. I don't want to see you.</font>

90
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,600
<font color="yellow">Good night. Make sure you lock the door.</font>

91
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh. It's cold.</font>

92
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,770
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,140
<font color="yellow">Who is it at this late hour? Who is it?</font>

94
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,700
<font color="yellow">It's me, Dal Pa.</font>

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa.</font>

96
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,470
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - Hi, Uncle.</font>

97
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,270
<font color="yellow">What brings you here without notice?</font>

98
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,370
<font color="yellow">- It's been a long time. - Let me bow to you.</font>

99
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,840
<font color="yellow">No. It's okay. Don't bother. Sit down.</font>

100
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,100
<font color="yellow">I couldn't buy anything because it's late.</font>

101
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,600
<font color="yellow">Go wake up your aunt.</font>

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

103
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,370
<font color="yellow">Is mum here?</font>

104
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,340
<font color="yellow">Sit down. Sleep here tonight.</font>

105
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,700
<font color="yellow">- Don't wake her up. - Did someone visit us?</font>

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,970
<font color="yellow">Aunt, it's me.</font>

107
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,970
<font color="yellow">- Please give me some food. - I'm not even full awake yet.</font>

108
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,240
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,640
<font color="yellow">Aunt, Dal Pa is here.</font>

110
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,900
<font color="yellow">What? When did he come?</font>

111
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,470
<font color="yellow">A minute ago. He's going to sleep over.</font>

112
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,440
<font color="yellow">He comes here without notice sometimes.</font>

113
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,440
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you let me know that you're coming?</font>

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
<font color="yellow">I could've made more food for you.</font>

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,500
<font color="yellow">Is your health all right?</font>

116
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,770
<font color="yellow">Where do you live now?</font>

117
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,770
<font color="yellow">Do you want more rice?</font>

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,070
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me and get out.</font>

119
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,840
<font color="yellow">How unfortunate I am.</font>

120
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,140
<font color="yellow">He's an annoying guest.</font>

121
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,470
<font color="yellow">How could he ask me for food as soon as he sees me?</font>

122
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,140
<font color="yellow">You practically raised him, so he must feel comfortable with you.</font>

123
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,670
<font color="yellow">I only recently freed myself from cooking for your dad.</font>

124
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,170
<font color="yellow">What is this in the middle of night?</font>

125
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,140
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for him because...</font>

126
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,140
<font color="yellow">he didn't get enough love from his mum and had to wander around.</font>

127
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,800
<font color="yellow">But I get upset when I think of Mal Nyeon.</font>

128
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,000
<font color="yellow">What if he ends up living here?</font>

129
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,070
<font color="yellow">How could she do that to her own child?</font>

130
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,510
<font color="yellow">- No wonder he disrespects his mum. - Be quiet.</font>

131
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,400
<font color="yellow">Aunt is in the living room.</font>

132
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,400
<font color="yellow">I don't mind if she hears it. I didn't say anything wrong.</font>

133
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,340
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa.</font>

134
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,510
<font color="yellow">Please make it quick.</font>

135
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,170
<font color="yellow">It's almost done. Wait a moment, please.</font>

136
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,010
<font color="yellow">- Please bring me a bottle of beer. - Yes.</font>

137
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,900
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your food.</font>

138
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,510
<font color="yellow">You came here to lure my father, didn't you?</font>

139
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,510
<font color="yellow">You came here pretending to take care of my father.</font>

140
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,740
<font color="yellow">But your real motive was to get money from him with your daughter.</font>

141
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,840
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - What is this called?</font>

142
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,600
<font color="yellow">That's right. You're a gold digger.</font>

143
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,870
<font color="yellow">Da Hae, go sleep in your room.</font>

144
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,400
<font color="yellow">I need to calculate this.</font>

145
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,070
<font color="yellow">Do it after you get some sleep. What time did you come in?</font>

146
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,740
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I worked until early morning.</font>

147
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,300
<font color="yellow">Go get some sleep first.</font>

148
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,570
<font color="yellow">I should do that.</font>

149
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,670
<font color="yellow">Please leave them as they are.</font>

150
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,870
<font color="yellow">It's this way.</font>

151
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

152
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,870
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Come out.</font>

160
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,940
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid of being scolded? Just follow me.</font>

161
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,970
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep at all.</font>

162
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,370
<font color="yellow">Me neither.</font>

163
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,170
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It's all because of me.</font>

164
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,500
<font color="yellow">My daughter had to take your money, and it became a big deal.</font>

165
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,970
<font color="yellow">I said something ridiculous because I was angry.</font>

166
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,070
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I asked you to marry me.</font>

167
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,870
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't say that just because you're angry.</font>

168
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

169
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,970
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm narrow-minded.</font>

170
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,200
<font color="yellow">I was upset because she even badmouthed my daughter.</font>

171
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,500
<font color="yellow">What did she say again?</font>

172
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,040
<font color="yellow">She called both of us gold diggers or something.</font>

173
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,500
<font color="yellow">I had never heard that from anybody, so I got furious.</font>

174
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,570
<font color="yellow">I thought, "Okay, then. I'll marry your dad and crush you."</font>

175
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,370
<font color="yellow">I told you that since I didn't want to lose to her and couldn't sleep.</font>

176
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,400
<font color="yellow">Since I got old, I can't control my mouth or anger.</font>

177
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,470
<font color="yellow">I regretted all night.</font>

178
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,340
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

179
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,070

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,240
<font color="yellow">I can still be a man and have passion.</font>

193

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,840
<font color="yellow">Ever since my husband died,</font>

195
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,340
<font color="yellow">I never had feelings for any man.</font>

196
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,970
<font color="yellow">I lived like a log that feels nothing.</font>

197
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,970
<font color="yellow">I thought I was like a dried squid,</font>

198

201
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,840
<font color="yellow">I was embarrassed to feel that way at this age.</font>

202

<font color="yellow">You saved me.</font>

203
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,740
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to you.</font>

204
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,100

205
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,670
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I found happiness and laughter.</font>

206
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,400

<font color="yellow">Getting the law to support you is all I can do.</font>

213
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,640
<font color="yellow">Then even without me around, you'll be able to make a living.</font>

226
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,070
<font color="yellow">You crazy woman. Do you think your son is any better?</font>

257
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, I just need to submit them to the district office.</font>

258
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800

261
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,140
<font color="yellow">It's not even your first divorce. I'm sure you're an expert.</font>

262

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,400
<font color="yellow">Make sure to choose wisely.</font>

272
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,640
<font color="yellow">She's not alone. She has Ddol Ee.</font>

273
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,210
<font color="yellow">It's not like she makes good money with a decent job.</font>

274
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,900
<font color="yellow">She needs to get married before she gets any older.</font>

275
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,600
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm not going to.</font>

276
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,240
<font color="yellow">I tried so hard not to get divorced twice.</font>

277
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,710
<font color="yellow">I'm never going to go through this again.</font>

278
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,000
<font color="yellow">Then what will you do alone?</font>

279
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,670
<font color="yellow">She can follow Gab Soon around and clean things here and there.</font>

280
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,870
<font color="yellow">Watch it!</font>

281
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,270
<font color="yellow">When you get lonely with old age,</font>

282
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,600
<font color="yellow">just befriend another divorced woman for comfort.</font>

283
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,470

284
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,800
<font color="yellow">There's no need to cause Ddol Ee more pain.</font>

285
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,640
<font color="yellow">- I understand. - Just let things go.</font>

286
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,210
<font color="yellow">Two attempts are enough.</font>

287
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,500
<font color="yellow">Don't count on the third person to be a keeper.</font>

288
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,600
<font color="yellow">Don't do that. Marriage isn't a lottery.</font>

289
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,170
<font color="yellow">But she's been so unfortunate.</font>

290
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,470
<font color="yellow">Once she gets older, no one will pity her any longer.</font>

291
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,940
<font color="yellow">Mum, I don't want to get married.</font>

292
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,710
<font color="yellow">Did Dal Pa stop by last night? I didn't even get to speak to him.</font>

293
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,800
<font color="yellow">He came in late and took a nap.</font>

294
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,240
<font color="yellow">He left at dawn.</font>

295
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,300
<font color="yellow">You should've given him something to eat.</font>

296
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,500
<font color="yellow">He never eats the food I make.</font>

297
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,040
<font color="yellow">Where is he nowadays?</font>

298
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,800
<font color="yellow">It's obvious. He wouldn't sleep here if he had a place to go.</font>

299
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
<font color="yellow">He lives in his car.</font>

300
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,000
<font color="yellow">The heater in his car broke, so he came without a choice.</font>

301
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,600
<font color="yellow">I guess things aren't going well for him, either.</font>

302
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,040
<font color="yellow">He does seem to have a conscience.</font>

303
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,670
<font color="yellow">Of course, he does.</font>

304
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,170
<font color="yellow">I told him to come in for the time being, but he refused.</font>

305
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,270
<font color="yellow">Come in? Not a chance.</font>

306
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,840
<font color="yellow">If you let him in, he'll never change.</font>

307
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,870
<font color="yellow">Tell him to rent a place somewhere with his mum.</font>

308
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,800
<font color="yellow">They're not on speaking terms.</font>

309
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,640
<font color="yellow">That's their problem.</font>

310
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,210
<font color="yellow">It's unfortunate for him, but I can't forgive her.</font>

311
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,570
<font color="yellow">Do you remember all the trouble she put me through?</font>

312
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,500
<font color="yellow">Life will reward you for your patience.</font>

313
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,270
<font color="yellow">Living like this is my reward.</font>

314
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,670
<font color="yellow">I'm so blessed that it's starting to get annoying.</font>

315
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,040
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

316
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,600
<font color="yellow">Are you going away somewhere far?</font>

317
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,540
<font color="yellow">I'm not exactly leaving. Just stop worrying for me.</font>

318
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,340
<font color="yellow">I'm all set up for retirement.</font>

319
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,840
<font color="yellow">Just take good care of yourselves.</font>

320
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,170
<font color="yellow">What's with you all of a sudden?</font>

321
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,740
<font color="yellow">I just need to rest.</font>

322
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,740
<font color="yellow">I'll be quitting work soon, too.</font>

323
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,210
<font color="yellow">Good choice, Mum.</font>

324
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,840
<font color="yellow">Quit delivering milk and your housekeeping side job.</font>

325
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,100
<font color="yellow">You seem to have saved up a lot of money.</font>

326
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

327
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,300
<font color="yellow">You didn't even bother to invest in my business.</font>

328
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,770
<font color="yellow">Let's wait and see.</font>

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
<font color="yellow">Don't even think of wanting her money.</font>

330
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,140
<font color="yellow">How much did you save up to take care of your retirement?</font>

331
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,240
<font color="yellow">- Is it at least a million dollars? - That's chump change.</font>

332
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,640
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

333
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,870
<font color="yellow">You're acting strange.</font>

334
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,370
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

335
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,000
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't quit your jobs for no reason.</font>

336
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,900
<font color="yellow">Did you win the lottery or something?</font>

337
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,270
<font color="yellow">I have to start taking care of my well-being.</font>

338
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,340
<font color="yellow">Doesn't the chairman object to you quitting?</font>

339
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,710
<font color="yellow">I thought he liked you. Maybe I'm wrong.</font>

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,140
<font color="yellow">What nonsense is that?</font>

341
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,000
<font color="yellow">You must be full, so go take a nap. You need to go to work soon.</font>

342
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,370
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

343
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,670
<font color="yellow">Come work at our shop sometimes.</font>

344
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,940
<font color="yellow">The grandpas would love you.</font>

345
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested at all.</font>

346
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,470
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

347
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Mum.</font>

348
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
<font color="yellow">A director?</font>

349
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,440
<font color="yellow">You need to start exploring your potential.</font>

350
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,170
<font color="yellow">You'll be appointed next week.</font>

351
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,940
<font color="yellow">Take charge of the overall responsibilities.</font>

352
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,470
<font color="yellow">My daughter will be appointed as the president.</font>

353
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,870
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

354
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,470
<font color="yellow">I never imagined this would happen.</font>

355
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,240
<font color="yellow">It's unaffiliated with my major. I'm not sure if I'll do well.</font>

356
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,800
<font color="yellow">One talent gives way to another.</font>

357
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,800
<font color="yellow">If you were a doctor, I wouldn't have thought of this.</font>

358
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,600
<font color="yellow">But now, I think the right choice has been made.</font>

359
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,070
<font color="yellow">No matter what my daughter says, don't let it hinder you.</font>

360
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,570
<font color="yellow">You have a difficult road ahead, but tackle it head on.</font>

361
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,640
<font color="yellow">You'll learn from your role and benefit the company.</font>

362
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,500
<font color="yellow">- Where were you this morning? - I visited the factory.</font>

363
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,640
<font color="yellow">I had a meeting with some designers.</font>

364
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,500
<font color="yellow">What business would you have with the designers?</font>

365
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,440
<font color="yellow">Your father instructed me to go.</font>

366
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,940
<font color="yellow">I'm the director here.</font>

367
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,470
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm unaware of your schemes?</font>

368
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,070
<font color="yellow">Don't be fooled. My father and I think very differently.</font>

369
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,770
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be more sensible.</font>

370
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you so worried? Others would be so envious.</font>

371
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,240
<font color="yellow">I heard inheriting wealth from the in-laws...</font>

372
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,070
<font color="yellow">is every man's dream.</font>

373
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,170
<font color="yellow">You can't complain. It's a tough world out there.</font>

374
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,340
<font color="yellow">I didn't quit the hospital for this.</font>

375
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,440
<font color="yellow">Things just happened.</font>

376
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,270
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what to do.</font>

377
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,970
<font color="yellow">How is it going with that guy?</font>

378
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,570
<font color="yellow">You should know. Dating isn't easy for doctors.</font>

379
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,300
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

380
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,540
<font color="yellow">I stepped out for a bit.</font>

381
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,270
<font color="yellow">Grandfather? Right now?</font>

382
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,400
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

383
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,900
<font color="yellow">I have to get going. I've been called for.</font>

384
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,040
<font color="yellow">Doctor or not, I guess I just go when I'm needed.</font>

385
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,100
<font color="yellow">Your humour is so self-deprecating.</font>

386
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

387
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,070
<font color="yellow">(Report of Marriage)</font>

388
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,840
<font color="yellow">(Wife: Nam Gi Ja)</font>

389
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,440
<font color="yellow">Let's break the news to our kids soon.</font>

390
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,100
<font color="yellow">Then let's hold a simple wedding ceremony and live together.</font>

391
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,740
<font color="yellow">What's the occasion, Dad?</font>

392
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,440
<font color="yellow">We haven't dined together like this in a while.</font>

393
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,940
<font color="yellow">What should we eat? How about a course meal?</font>

394
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,470
<font color="yellow">Can I order something expensive?</font>

395
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,540
<font color="yellow">Of course. Order whatever you like.</font>

396
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,970
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married.</font>

397
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,170
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

398
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,870
<font color="yellow">With whom? Were you dating someone, Grandpa?</font>

399
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, you all know her well.</font>

400
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,700
<font color="yellow">Who do you mean?</font>

401
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,670
<font color="yellow">Gi Ja.</font>

402
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,140
<font color="yellow">Our housekeeper?</font>

403
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,040
<font color="yellow">- There's nothing more to hear. - Mum!</font>

404
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,270
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

405
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

406
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,670
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

407
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,940
<font color="yellow">Did you forget our promise?</font>

408
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
<font color="yellow">I have not.</font>

409
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,000
<font color="yellow">- Si Nae... - Take it back.</font>

410
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,270
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about persuading me.</font>

411
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,670
<font color="yellow">I'm in my 70s now.</font>

412
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,670
<font color="yellow">I need someone to lean on.</font>

413
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,740
<font color="yellow">You don't have the right to say that.</font>

414
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,440
<font color="yellow">Mum died because of you.</font>

415
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,100
<font color="yellow">A surgery could've saved her.</font>

416
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,900
<font color="yellow">Nothing could've saved her.</font>

417
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,340
<font color="yellow">Stop your excuses.</font>

418
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,340
<font color="yellow">You were scared of the expenses. That was all Mum's money.</font>

419
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,570
<font color="yellow">If you sold the land, Mum would've lived.</font>

420
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,540
<font color="yellow">Your mum pleaded for us not to.</font>

421
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,070
<font color="yellow">She said the living must continue to live.</font>

422
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,240
<font color="yellow">Do you think that makes sense?</font>

423
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,570
<font color="yellow">It wasn't easy for me to let your mother go.</font>

424
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,740
<font color="yellow">It took me decades to get over her death.</font>

425
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,040
<font color="yellow">I lived my life in repentance.</font>

426
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,700
<font color="yellow">For over thirty years, my eyes were closed.</font>

427
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,700
<font color="yellow">It's not a simple dating proposal.</font>

428
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,940
<font color="yellow">You're speaking of marriage.</font>

429
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

430
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,870
<font color="yellow">Who you meet or lean on is not my concern.</font>

431
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
<font color="yellow">But an official marriage can never happen.</font>

432
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,100
<font color="yellow">I refuse to share this household's inheritance.</font>

433
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,940
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that she has ulterior motives?</font>

434
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,770
<font color="yellow">No matter what you say,</font>

435
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,270
<font color="yellow">my decision is final.</font>

436
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,500
<font color="yellow">Do you remember me running away...</font>

437
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,540
<font color="yellow">after Mum passed away?</font>

438
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,640
<font color="yellow">I was a sophomore in high school.</font>

439
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,640
<font color="yellow">Of course I remember.</font>

440
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,300
<font color="yellow">I searched the whole country for a year.</font>

441
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,670
<font color="yellow">During that time,</font>

442
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,940
<font color="yellow">I gave birth to a son.</font>

443
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,070
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

444
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,640
<font color="yellow">You had a child?</font>

445
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,270
<font color="yellow">My dear husband, have you been well?</font>

446
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,000
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

447
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,340
<font color="yellow">Isn't it cold?</font>

448
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,540
<font color="yellow">Thank you for helping Gab Dol get employed.</font>

449
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,200
<font color="yellow">Da Hae opened her shop, too.</font>

450
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,670
<font color="yellow">Our children are growing up just fine.</font>

451
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,770
<font color="yellow">I've done well, right?</font>

452
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,600
<font color="yellow">I came because I have something to tell you.</font>

453
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,800
<font color="yellow">Some fellow says he likes me.</font>

454
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,100
<font color="yellow">He wants to get married.</font>

455
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,100
<font color="yellow">I'm old now.</font>

456
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,640
<font color="yellow">I need someone to lean on and be taken care of.</font>

457
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,900
<font color="yellow">Soon, there will be no energy left in my bones.</font>

458
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,570
<font color="yellow">Housekeeping is hard work.</font>

459
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,540
<font color="yellow">When I'm older,</font>

460
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,540
<font color="yellow">I want someone to eat beside me...</font>

461
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,540
<font color="yellow">and to look after me when I'm sick.</font>

462
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,540
<font color="yellow">Will that be all right?</font>

463
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,100
<font color="yellow">Will it be okay if I don't apologise?</font>

464
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,140
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

465
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,540
<font color="yellow">It's me, Ha Soo.</font>

466
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,470
<font color="yellow">We need to meet and talk.</font>

467
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do that.</font>

468
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,000
<font color="yellow">Let's call it a day.</font>

469
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go Dutch and reward ourselves...</font>

470
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,670
<font color="yellow">with a nice meal for working on an off day.</font>

471
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,470
<font color="yellow">I have someone to meet. I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

472
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,140
<font color="yellow">What's the issue?</font>

473
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,100
<font color="yellow">I need to confirm your attitude.</font>

474
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,140
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

475
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,440
<font color="yellow">I think it was the day you passed your exam.</font>

476
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,300
<font color="yellow">Do you know what your mother said to Gab Soon that day?</font>

477
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,140
<font color="yellow">I couldn't allow Gab Soon to get victimised like that,</font>

478
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,600
<font color="yellow">so I dragged her away.</font>

479
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,170
<font color="yellow">But I wouldn't let my girl hear something like that.</font>

480
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,370
<font color="yellow">What have you done for her?</font>

481
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,740
<font color="yellow">I don't want to interfere with a 10-year relationship.</font>

482
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,170
<font color="yellow">But now, I think it's time to act.</font>

483
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,870
<font color="yellow">From now on, I won't make any guarantees.</font>

484
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,100
<font color="yellow">You understand me, right?</font>

485
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,340
<font color="yellow">I made my intentions clear.</font>

486
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,000
<font color="yellow">- Are you waiting for Gab Soon? - Yes.</font>

487
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,940
<font color="yellow">Do you even have the right to stand here?</font>

488
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,370
<font color="yellow">- What? - Why was that girl at your house?</font>

489
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,770
<font color="yellow">She already seems so close with your mum.</font>

490
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't it because you guys are already thinking of marriage?</font>

491
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,840
<font color="yellow">If Gab Soon found out, things would get serious.</font>

492
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
<font color="yellow">No matter how I look at it, it's not right.</font>

493
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,270
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - Stop what? Am I wrong?</font>

494
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,270
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

495
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,740
<font color="yellow">What's the thing I shouldn't know?</font>

496
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,140
<font color="yellow">- Let me explain. - I couldn't stand watching him...</font>

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
<font color="yellow">get friendly with a female co-worker outside of work.</font>

498
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,740
<font color="yellow">I have to make a delivery.</font>

499
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,240
<font color="yellow">- Let's talk. - There's nothing to talk about.</font>

500
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,240
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Let go.</font>

501
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,570
<font color="yellow">My gosh. What's wrong with you?</font>

502
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,970
<font color="yellow">Just wait one week. That's all I ask for.</font>

503
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,300
<font color="yellow">- I'll get my mum's permission. - She won't allow it.</font>

504
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,800
<font color="yellow">I don't care. We're getting married no matter what.</font>

505
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,570
<font color="yellow">Just give me a week.</font>

506
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,400
<font color="yellow">I won't believe you no matter what you say.</font>

507
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being weak and indecisive.</font>

508
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,270
<font color="yellow">Let's grow old together.</font>

509
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,570
<font color="yellow">I promise you.</font>

510
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,100
<font color="yellow">It's been 10 years. Can't you wait a week?</font>

511
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,770
<font color="yellow">Just one week, all right?</font>

512
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,500
<font color="yellow">Please trust me this once.</font>

513
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

514
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,400
<font color="yellow">- Mum... - Hello, Ma'am.</font>

515
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,570

516
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,000
<font color="yellow">- I thought you separated. - Don't do this, Mum.</font>

517
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,700
<font color="yellow">You head on home. Gab Soon, we have to talk.</font>

518
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

519

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,870
<font color="yellow">Are you deaf? How can you be so defiant?</font>

521
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,640
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Blame me instead.</font>

522
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,140
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

523
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,400
<font color="yellow">- Gab Soon... - Mum, let's talk at home.</font>

<font color="yellow">What favour?</font>

539
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,570

<font color="yellow">What is so special about Gab Dol?</font>

558
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,110
<font color="yellow">He may have escaped being a loser now that he's a public official.</font>

<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

562
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,670
<font color="yellow">I only said that because you said the same thing about my child.</font>

<font color="yellow">What's so special about being a public official?</font>

<font color="yellow">What's so special about receiving pension?</font>

569
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,400
<font color="yellow">At least Gab Soon had part-time jobs.</font>

570
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,440
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol didn't even have a job. All he did was study, right?</font>

571
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,640
<font color="yellow">If he didn't pass the test even after that, he's a fool.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm the one who should be surprised.</font>

576
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,300
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's okay to step all over someone else's feelings?</font>

577
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,670
<font color="yellow">Even if you beg me to change my mind,</font>

578
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,670
<font color="yellow">I will not allow Gab Soon to marry Gab Dol.</font>

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,570
<font color="yellow">- Shin Gab Soon. Come out. - Come out, Gab Soon.</font>

585
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,640
<font color="yellow">She came in crying, too.</font>

586
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,340
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

587
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

588
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,940
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about Gab Dol?</font>

589
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,200
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol's mother thinks you guys aren't seeing each other any more.</font>

590
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,000
<font color="yellow">That means he didn't even mention you to her.</font>

591
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,170
<font color="yellow">He told me to wait one week. He said he will get her approval.</font>

592
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,700
<font color="yellow">Do you think that will happen?</font>

593
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,700
<font color="yellow">He told me that he will get married even without her approval.</font>

594
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,040
<font color="yellow">Stop seeing him.</font>

595
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,440
<font color="yellow">I want you to end it.</font>

596
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,700
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - In my opinion,</font>

597
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,900
<font color="yellow">his mother will never approve.</font>

598
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,770
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol is not strong enough to overcome her, either.</font>

599
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,370
<font color="yellow">True. If not, he would've gotten her approval a long time ago.</font>

600
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,770
<font color="yellow">What could a fool like him accomplish?</font>

601
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,440
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that Gab Dol is seeing another girl?</font>

602
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,770
<font color="yellow">He's seeing another girl?</font>

603
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,540
<font color="yellow">That rotten scoundrel. He didn't say anything the last time I saw him.</font>

604
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,940
<font color="yellow">Why did you meet with him?</font>

605
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,440
<font color="yellow">Did you beg him to take back Gab Soon?</font>

606
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,870
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stand to watch her being a cleaning lady.</font>

607
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,110
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon took care of him for 10 years. How can he do such a thing?</font>

608
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,770
<font color="yellow">But now, he's seeing another girl? What a scoundrel!</font>

609
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,670
<font color="yellow">People are like that.</font>

610
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,370
<font color="yellow">People change when they taste success.</font>

611
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,610
<font color="yellow">He's not seeing her. She's just a co-worker.</font>

612
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,370
<font color="yellow">I don't care. I no longer approve.</font>

613
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,570
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be in-laws with that family.</font>

614
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,070
<font color="yellow">You better become successful in the future.</font>

615
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,270
<font color="yellow">I want you to be more successful than Gab Dol.</font>

616
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,640
<font color="yellow">Yes. You must become more successful.</font>

617
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,200
<font color="yellow">You should marry someone more successful than Gab Dol.</font>

618
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,540
<font color="yellow">You should live next to him...</font>

619
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,070
<font color="yellow">and show him how happy you are.</font>

620
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,240
<font color="yellow">That's how you get back at him.</font>

621
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,740
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

622
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,470
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

623
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,070
<font color="yellow">How could he leave me standing...</font>

624
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,500
<font color="yellow">and take her by her wrist and tell her that she doesn't need to listen?</font>

625
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,110
<font color="yellow">I'm flabbergasted.</font>

626
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,070
<font color="yellow">You can't count on your son.</font>

627
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,300
<font color="yellow">Now that he's making money, he's treating his mother like garbage.</font>

628
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,070
<font color="yellow">You always favoured him over me. I'm glad he treats you that way.</font>

629
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,140
<font color="yellow">I expected Gab Dol to be different.</font>

630
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,700
<font color="yellow">Wake up. All sons are alike.</font>

631
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,800
<font color="yellow">Mothers with sons are all alike, too.</font>

632
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,570
<font color="yellow">Leave it to me.</font>

633
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,640
<font color="yellow">I will take care of this.</font>

634
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,370
<font color="yellow">Your mother met my father.</font>

635
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,700
<font color="yellow">My father told me to end my relationship with you.</font>

636
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,070
<font color="yellow">My father has never been this upset.</font>

637
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,170
<font color="yellow">- What should I do? - What did my mother say?</font>

638
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,740
<font color="yellow">Mum, this is all you amount to?</font>

639
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,570
<font color="yellow">You should have stopped when I dragged Gab Soon away.</font>

640
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,970
<font color="yellow">Did you have to meet Gab Soon's father?</font>

641
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,940
<font color="yellow">How could you say such hurtful things to him?</font>

642
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,170
<font color="yellow">What's so special about me?</font>

643
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,370
<font color="yellow">I'm so disappointed in you.</font>

644
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,740
<font color="yellow">I can't believe what you're saying.</font>

645
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,900
<font color="yellow">I'm flabbergasted.</font>

646
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,140
<font color="yellow">I think he's definitely changed.</font>

647
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,700
<font color="yellow">How dare you speak to her that way!</font>

648
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,040
<font color="yellow">Did you become a public official all by yourself?</font>

649
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,200
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that mum prayed everyday for you?</font>

650
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,000
<font color="yellow">Stop being so arrogant.</font>

651
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,770
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

652
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,610
<font color="yellow">Don't mention Gab Soon in front of me from now on.</font>

653
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

654
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,970
<font color="yellow">I can't leave Gab Soon.</font>

655
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,070
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

656
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,170
<font color="yellow">I was going to wait until you approved.</font>

657
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,940
<font color="yellow">I know what you had to go through because of me.</font>

658
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,070
<font color="yellow">That's why I was cold to her.</font>

659
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,170
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon stood by me for 10 years.</font>

660
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,040
<font color="yellow">But I ignored her even when all my friends badmouthed me.</font>

661
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,140
<font color="yellow">It was all because I didn't want to hurt you.</font>

662
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,240
<font color="yellow">But I can't do this any more.</font>

663
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,240
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm sorry.</font>

664
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,140
<font color="yellow">I am going to marry Gab Soon.</font>

665
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,200
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

666
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,140
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Gab Soon understands how her father feels.</font>

667
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,870
<font color="yellow">Where are you? I heard that you're still not home.</font>

668
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,170
<font color="yellow">Go home while I'm still nice.</font>

669
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,110
<font color="yellow">(Where are you? I heard that you're still not home.)</font>

670
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,270
<font color="yellow">(Go home while I'm still nice.)</font>

671
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,040
<font color="yellow">I brought some left over sweet and sour pork, too.</font>

672
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,040
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to go home?</font>

673
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,970
<font color="yellow">What's your plan?</font>

674
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,040
<font color="yellow">You know that all this will return to Gab Soon, right?</font>

675
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,470
<font color="yellow">Let's just drink tonight.</font>

676
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,240
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

677
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,540
<font color="yellow">I was afraid of getting hurt again.</font>

678
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,240
<font color="yellow">I put a wall around me,</font>

679
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,500
<font color="yellow">even though you are such a kind person.</font>

680
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,070
<font color="yellow">(Jae Soon)</font>

681
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,170
<font color="yellow">Can we meet?</font>

682
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,440
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

683
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,040
<font color="yellow">No, nothing happened.</font>

684
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,300
<font color="yellow">I feel like I should tell you something.</font>

685
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,800
<font color="yellow">I thought you were very strong.</font>

686
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,470
<font color="yellow">It was my first time seeing you cry like that.</font>

687
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,700
<font color="yellow">I could imagine...</font>

688
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,340
<font color="yellow">how hard it must have been for you. I keep thinking about that.</font>

689
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,800
<font color="yellow">Please erase it from your memory. I shouldn't have done that.</font>

690
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,300
<font color="yellow">What do you think about me?</font>

691
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,070
<font color="yellow">You don't really know much about me, do you?</font>

692
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,400
<font color="yellow">We got married only three months after we met.</font>

693
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,470
<font color="yellow">We didn't have time to get to know each other.</font>

694
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,440
<font color="yellow">We didn't even date each other properly.</font>

695
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,400
<font color="yellow">Now that I look back, I have many regrets.</font>

696
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,070
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to think highly of me because I already had a son.</font>

697
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,370
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make sure that your children liked me.</font>

698
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,770
<font color="yellow">I tried to cling on so I could avoid going through another divorce.</font>

699
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,800
<font color="yellow">I didn't get the chance to get to know you.</font>

700
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:13,400
<font color="yellow">You are a very nice person.</font>

701
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,640
<font color="yellow">I wish I had known earlier.</font>

702
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,370
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be friends?</font>

703
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
<font color="yellow">- Friends? - I can drink, too.</font>

704
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,170
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

705
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,240
<font color="yellow">I can curse, too. I can be mean.</font>

706
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,170
<font color="yellow">I've been trying to behave well in front of you.</font>

707
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,640
<font color="yellow">I had no idea.</font>

708
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not who you think I am.</font>

709
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,940
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious of what I'm really like?</font>

710
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,470
<font color="yellow">If you're curious, let's be drink buddies.</font>

711
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,940
<font color="yellow">We're similar in situations.</font>

712
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,800
<font color="yellow">We've been divorced twice. We both have children, too.</font>

713
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,240
<font color="yellow">You only have 1, but I have 2.</font>

714
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,470
<font color="yellow">Let's take one step at a time.</font>

715
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,170
<font color="yellow">Let's get to know each other better.</font>

716
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,640
<font color="yellow">I don't where that may lead us to.</font>

717
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,740
<font color="yellow">Here's to being good friends.</font>

718
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you for reaching out to me.</font>

719
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,340
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

720
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,700
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Wait.</font>

721
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,400
<font color="yellow">- Did you see a watch on my desk? - No, I didn't.</font>

722
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,600
<font color="yellow">I left my watch here. You didn't see it?</font>

723
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,470
<font color="yellow">I didn't even go near that desk.</font>

724
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,400
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who entered this room. Who else would take it?</font>

725
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,040
<font color="yellow">- I didn't do it. - Then who took it?</font>

726
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
<font color="yellow">Are we good now?</font>

727
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,700
<font color="yellow">No. Let's go to the police.</font>

728
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,270
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you afraid?</font>

729
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,470
<font color="yellow">I have to deliver water.</font>

730
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,170
<font color="yellow">Don't try to escape. Give it to me now.</font>

731
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,170
<font color="yellow">Then I will pretend like it didn't happen.</font>

732
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,540
<font color="yellow">Let me make a phone call.</font>

733
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,870
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. Call everyone. Call your parents.</font>

734
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,400
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

735
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,970
<font color="yellow">I have to go somewhere urgently. I can't do any deliveries right now.</font>

736
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,500
<font color="yellow">I will finish even if it takes all night.</font>

737
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

738
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,500
<font color="yellow">I am certain that I left it on my desk.</font>

739
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,970
<font color="yellow">He's the only one who came into the office. He's denying everything.</font>

740
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,140
<font color="yellow">Did you look everywhere?</font>

741
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,940
<font color="yellow">He emptied his pockets,</font>

742
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,670
<font color="yellow">but who knows where he hid it?</font>

743
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,500
<font color="yellow">I will go through any investigation.</font>

744
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,270
<font color="yellow">Let's go and have a look.</font>

745
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,270
<font color="yellow">Could you take off your trousers?</font>

746
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:34,570
<font color="yellow">You found it, didn't you?</font>

747
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,070
<font color="yellow">I searched him. It's not on him.</font>

748
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,700
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

749
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,870
<font color="yellow">I could tell that it wasn't his first time by the way he denied it.</font>

750
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,100
<font color="yellow">Could you do a background check?</font>

751
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,400
<font color="yellow">You mean a criminal record check?</font>

752
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, please check his criminal records. I'm sure he has records.</font>

753
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,300
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

754
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,670
<font color="yellow">Can I see your identification?</font>

755
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,040
<font color="yellow">I don't have it with me.</font>

756
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,840
<font color="yellow">Can you give me your registration number and name?</font>

757
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,900
<font color="yellow">Mum, what happened? Why are you at the police station?</font>

758
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,670
<font color="yellow">He stole my watch, but he won't admit it.</font>

759
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,670
<font color="yellow">I can't believe my luck.</font>

760
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,870
<font color="yellow">I'm stressed out as it is.</font>

761
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,770
<font color="yellow">Watch? This one?</font>

762
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,870
<font color="yellow">Why are you wearing that?</font>

763
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,900
<font color="yellow">I told you this morning that I was going to wear it.</font>

764
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,470
<font color="yellow">Is this what you were looking for?</font>

765
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,200
<font color="yellow">You should have been more careful.</font>

766
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,800
<font color="yellow">He must've been so mortified.</font>

767
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
<font color="yellow">- Please apologise. - Well...</font>

768
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,070
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and apologise.</font>

769
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,640
<font color="yellow">The worst thing in the world is to be wrongly accused.</font>

770
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,070
<font color="yellow">Things like this can happen.</font>

771
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,370
<font color="yellow">I asked for an apology.</font>

772
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,670
<font color="yellow">Mum, just apologise. I'm so embarrassed.</font>

773
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,770
<font color="yellow">It's unfortunate that this happened.</font>

774
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,500
<font color="yellow">I was just stressed out today.</font>

775
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,940
<font color="yellow">Instead, I will have you deliver water at my factory, too.</font>

776
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,400
<font color="yellow">Please apologise properly!</font>

777
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,270
<font color="yellow">Why are you raising your voice?</font>

778
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you have parents?</font>

779
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,270
<font color="yellow">I apologised. What more do you want?</font>

780
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,370
<font color="yellow">Do you want money?</font>

781
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,000
<font color="yellow">Just let it go.</font>

782
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,440
<font color="yellow">That's enough. Just leave please.</font>

783
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,470
<font color="yellow">I don't know how rich you are,</font>

784
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,570
<font color="yellow">but you shouldn't mistreat people just because they're poor.</font>

785
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,840
<font color="yellow">Shame on you.</font>

786
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,140
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? Mistakes can happen. What a terrible temper!</font>

787
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,570
<font color="yellow">You went too far.</font>

788
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,800
<font color="yellow">You should apologise properly the next time you see him.</font>

789
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,400
<font color="yellow">You should know better.</font>

790
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,770
<font color="yellow">Mum, let's go. You should have been more careful.</font>

791
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,970
<font color="yellow">My son doesn't want me to do this any more.</font>

792
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,470
<font color="yellow">He's worried that my body will be ruined.</font>

793
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,000
<font color="yellow">He's already delivering water and alcohol.</font>

794
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,400
<font color="yellow">He groans all night from the body ache.</font>

795
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,770
<font color="yellow">You haven't told him, have you?</font>

796
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,200
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell him before his marriage, but I haven't.</font>

797
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,800
<font color="yellow">I feel really bad.</font>

798
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,970
<font color="yellow">What's there to be sorry about? You gave your all to him.</font>

799
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,800
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now that you're jobless?</font>

800
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,870
<font color="yellow">Why don't you work on these?</font>

801
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,500
<font color="yellow">I'd rather go work at the senior club.</font>

802
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,700
<font color="yellow">I was going to quit being a waiter.</font>

803
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,540
<font color="yellow">Can you make a decent living out of this?</font>

804
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,140
<font color="yellow">It's enough for a pack of instant noodles.</font>

805
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,740
<font color="yellow">(Dongsan District Office)</font>

806
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,870
<font color="yellow">- Hi. - Hi.</font>

807
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,500
<font color="yellow">Are you here to see Gab Dol?</font>

808
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,200
<font color="yellow">He's not answering his phone.</font>

809
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,800
<font color="yellow">- Could you give this to him? - Sure.</font>

810
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,170
<font color="yellow">It looks like underwear. Did you stay out all night?</font>

811
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,570
<font color="yellow">You can eat anywhere, but you should sleep at home.</font>

812
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,470
<font color="yellow">Public officials must behave properly.</font>

813
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,840
<font color="yellow">Did you see him? What did he say?</font>

814
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,070
<font color="yellow">I didn't even get to see him.</font>

815
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,900
<font color="yellow">He won't answer his phone.</font>

816
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,400
<font color="yellow">He seems to be at work at least.</font>

817
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,370
<font color="yellow">What an ingrate! He refused to see you?</font>

818
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,440
<font color="yellow">Did they spend the night together?</font>

819
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,970
<font color="yellow">- What? - Let's see.</font>

820
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,170
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

821
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,000
<font color="yellow">How dare you stay out all night.</font>

822
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,570
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with you? - Be honest.</font>

823
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,840
<font color="yellow">Were you with Gab Soon last night?</font>

824
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,100
<font color="yellow">It's my business whom I was with.</font>

825
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,800
<font color="yellow">So I guess you were together.</font>

826
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,700
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live together again?</font>

827
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,900
<font color="yellow">Whether I marry her or live with her is my business.</font>

828
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,370
<font color="yellow">You will do it without Mum's approval, is that it?</font>

829
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:43,870
<font color="yellow">- I will. - You will regret later.</font>

830
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't realise this before,</font>

831
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,270
<font color="yellow">but when I look back,</font>

832
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,070
<font color="yellow">it kills me to think that I made Mum worry.</font>

833
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,100
<font color="yellow">Mum is the most unfortunate person I know.</font>

834
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,900
<font color="yellow">She didn't date anyone because of us.</font>

835
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,340
<font color="yellow">She never enjoyed luxury and worked all her life.</font>

836
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:05,340
<font color="yellow">If you cause her any trouble, I will not tolerate it.</font>

837
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,870
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you're my brother.</font>

838
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,840
<font color="yellow">It's enough that I made her suffer. Don't add to her suffering.</font>

839
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,770
<font color="yellow">You and I are not the same.</font>

840
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,600
<font color="yellow">Why should I pay for your mistakes?</font>

841
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,940
<font color="yellow">You should worry about yourself.</font>

842
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,740
<font color="yellow">I have the right.</font>

843
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,800
<font color="yellow">I have the right to say this to you.</font>

844
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,840
<font color="yellow">Whenever Mum went to work,</font>

845
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,140
<font color="yellow">I fed you and took care of you.</font>

846
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,400
<font color="yellow">I gave up on going to university because of you.</font>

847
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,540
<font color="yellow">Can't I say this much to you?</font>

848
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,970
<font color="yellow">I'm not telling you to be good to me.</font>

849
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,470
<font color="yellow">Be good to Mum, you jerk.</font>

850
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,870
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

851
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,570
<font color="yellow">Give up on Gab Dol. He's different this time.</font>

852
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,700
<font color="yellow">I think he made up his mind.</font>

853
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,300
<font color="yellow">I believe he was with her last night.</font>

854
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,070
<font color="yellow">He says he'll marry her or live with her.</font>

855
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,270
<font color="yellow">I don't think Gab Soon will let him go.</font>

856
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,370
<font color="yellow">Give up on that jerk.</font>

857
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,100
<font color="yellow">I have to go. I need to open the store.</font>

858
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,600
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

859
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,770
<font color="yellow">I finished making the ladder.</font>

860
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,700
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see it?</font>

861
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,470
<font color="yellow">Are you in the area?</font>

862
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,540
<font color="yellow">Come quick.</font>

863
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,000
<font color="yellow">Are you here already?</font>

864
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,070
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - Okay.</font>

865
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,670
<font color="yellow">- Where was Gab Soon last night? - Pardon?</font>

866
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,900
<font color="yellow">Come in first.</font>

867
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,270
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

868
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,240
<font color="yellow">She wasn't home last night, was she?</font>

869
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,170
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

870
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,340
<font color="yellow">- Your pants... - My pants?</font>

871
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, goodness.</font>

872
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,640
<font color="yellow">Since you're here, please come in and sit down.</font>

873
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,040
<font color="yellow">There's no need for that.</font>

874
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,300
<font color="yellow">Where was she last night?</font>

875
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,340
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that?</font>

876
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:05,040
<font color="yellow">I have to check something.</font>

877
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,870
<font color="yellow">She went out to do a night cleaning.</font>

878
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,170
<font color="yellow">A night cleaning?</font>

879
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,370
<font color="yellow">- That means she wasn't home. - Yes.</font>

880
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,840
<font color="yellow">How did you raise your daughter?</font>

881
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,470
<font color="yellow">She seduced my innocent son to spend the night out.</font>

882
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,240
<font color="yellow">Do you think this makes sense?</font>

883
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,440
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

884
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,970
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd approve of her if she did that?</font>

885
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,340
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

886
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,000
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

887
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,940
<font color="yellow">She cleaned all night and came home early in the morning.</font>

888
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,270
<font color="yellow">Did you see her cleaning? You didn't, did you?</font>

889
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,100
<font color="yellow">I didn't, but I'm sure she did.</font>

890
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,400
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

891
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,470
<font color="yellow">Why is she here?</font>

892
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,270
<font color="yellow">She's asking me where Gab Soon was last night.</font>

893
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,470
<font color="yellow">She has no manners at all!</font>

894
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,970
<font color="yellow">You're talking nonsense.</font>

895
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,000
<font color="yellow">I can't believe what I'm seeing.</font>

896
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,770
<font color="yellow">What are you doing at my house?</font>

897
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,470
<font color="yellow">- Where is your sister? - She went to buy ice cream.</font>

898
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,100
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon went cleaning last night, right?</font>

899
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's what she said.</font>

900
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,340
<font color="yellow">It looks like you guys are all in on this.</font>

901
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,740
<font color="yellow">She tried to hold onto my son by putting on a show...</font>

902
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,600
<font color="yellow">and saying she was pregnant.</font>

903
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,470
<font color="yellow">The whole family's plotting, now that my son is a public official.</font>

904
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:16,140
<font color="yellow">Plotting? I can't believe what this woman is saying.</font>

905
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,440
<font color="yellow">Where were you last night?</font>

906
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,040
<font color="yellow">Tell me where you were.</font>

907
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,270
<font color="yellow">You went cleaning last night, right?</font>

908
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,370
<font color="yellow">Did you meet Gab Dol?</font>

909
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,040
<font color="yellow">You can't answer us because you were with him.</font>

910
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,740
<font color="yellow">- Did you seduce him? - Tell me the truth.</font>

911
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,500
<font color="yellow">I cleaned all night because someone was moving in today.</font>

912
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,140
<font color="yellow">I didn't meet Gab Dol. I ended it with him already.</font>

913
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,940
<font color="yellow">That's what you say.</font>

914
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,670
<font color="yellow">Come on, I know you.</font>

915
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,870
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows that you've been after Gab Dol for 10 years.</font>

916
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,000
<font color="yellow">Your son was after my daughter!</font>

917
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,240
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

918
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,670
<font color="yellow">We won't see Gab Dol, and we won't let her see him.</font>

919
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,970
<font color="yellow">Let's not see each other like this. Please leave.</font>

920
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,600
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's what I want to say.</font>

921
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,640
<font color="yellow">Please, I beg you. Let's not see each other any more.</font>

922
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,200
<font color="yellow">Please don't follow my son and lure him in.</font>

923
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,000
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I know?</font>

924
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,170
<font color="yellow">I can see clearly what you're thinking.</font>

925
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,770
<font color="yellow">- That wench. - Hey.</font>

926
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:18,970
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

927
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:20,900
<font color="yellow">Did you see that?</font>

928
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:25,300
<font color="yellow">Did you see how that woman treated us?</font>

929
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,470
<font color="yellow">She even rolled her eyes at us.</font>

930
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,400
<font color="yellow">If you had a proper job, she wouldn't have looked down on us.</font>

931
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,670
<font color="yellow">She's belittling all of us. Are you happy now?</font>

932
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,840
<font color="yellow">- Mum! - Come on. What are you doing?</font>

933
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,040
<font color="yellow">What good did she do to deserve this?</font>

934
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,970
<font color="yellow">My pride has been hurt. I can't live like this.</font>

935
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,540
<font color="yellow">If you had lived your life properly,</font>

936
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,340
<font color="yellow">a woman like her wouldn't look down on us.</font>

937
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,340
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

938
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,700
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Get out.</font>

939
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,570
<font color="yellow">Get out right now!</font>

940
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,770
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mum. I'll take her out.</font>

941
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,200
<font color="yellow">I'm so mad.</font>

942
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,670
<font color="yellow">How can she come all the way here and make a fuss?</font>

943
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,540
<font color="yellow">I can't believe her.</font>

944
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,000
<font color="yellow">She thinks I spent the night with him.</font>

945
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,300
<font color="yellow">Mum even broke the ladder.</font>

946
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,700
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Gab Dol's mum?</font>

947
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,370
<font color="yellow">I'll end it with him.</font>

948
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,670
<font color="yellow">Can you do that?</font>

949
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,440
<font color="yellow">I can't go on when my parents are acting like that.</font>

950
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want to break their hearts.</font>

951
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,740
<font color="yellow">I see no solution for this, either.</font>

952
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,600
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

953
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,900
<font color="yellow">I just bought sushi. Let's eat together.</font>

954
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,340
<font color="yellow">I'll help you clean.</font>

955
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,040
<font color="yellow">I was going to call you.</font>

956
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,770
<font color="yellow">Let's meet now.</font>

957
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,440
<font color="yellow">You read my mind. I'll be right there.</font>

958
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:00,940
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

959
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,900
<font color="yellow">I told you to wait a week.</font>

960
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,440
<font color="yellow">There are only three days left. Can't you wait?</font>

961
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,470
<font color="yellow">Even if they approve, I can't do this any more.</font>

962
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,840
<font color="yellow">Let's not go the hard way.</font>

963
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,500
<font color="yellow">Let's stop here.</font>

964
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,970
<font color="yellow">I'm happy I got to see how you felt about me.</font>

965
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,740
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

966
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,100
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

967
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,840
<font color="yellow">I can't break up with you.</font>

968
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,000
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

969
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:27,370
<font color="yellow">I can't win against my parents. I just can't.</font>

970
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,170
<font color="yellow">We can't break up like this. Do you want me to go crazy?</font>

971
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,400
<font color="yellow">I won't change my mind.</font>

972
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,300
<font color="yellow">I tried my best to get a job.</font>

973
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,640
<font color="yellow">"I'll do something once I get a job."</font>

974
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,570
<font color="yellow">You were always on my mind.</font>

975
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,240
<font color="yellow">I could push myself to study hard to make something of myself...</font>

976
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,600
<font color="yellow">because of you.</font>

977
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,940
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

978
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:52,370
<font color="yellow">Without you, I have no life.</font>

979
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,300
<font color="yellow">To me, success means nothing without you.</font>

980
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,900
<font color="yellow">I lived for you and because of you.</font>

981
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,170
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do if you fall apart like this?</font>

982
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,840
<font color="yellow">I could come this far because you stood strong.</font>

983
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:12,970
<font color="yellow">What will I do?</font>

984
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,440
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

985
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,100
<font color="yellow">Drinking buddy, are you asleep?</font>

986
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,000
<font color="yellow">Can you come out for a minute?</font>

987
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,370
<font color="yellow">Mum, are you sleeping?</font>

988
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,600
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

989
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,340
<font color="yellow">I'm going out to meet a friend.</font>

990
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:25,870
<font color="yellow">Is your mum fast asleep?</font>

991
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I've been through it all.</font>

992
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,200
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

993
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,770
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

994
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,500
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

995
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,000
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you cold? - No.</font>

996
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,800
<font color="yellow">I love eel!</font>

997
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,470
<font color="yellow">That's why I ordered it.</font>

998
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,770
<font color="yellow">What about Ddol Ee?</font>

999
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:05,070
<font color="yellow">I forced him to go to bed so I can come out.</font>

1000
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:07,840
<font color="yellow">What about your kids?</font>

1001
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,000
<font color="yellow">I left them at home, too.</font>

1002
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,670
<font color="yellow">They're sleeping with A Young.</font>

1003
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,470
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

1004
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I should say this.</font>

1005
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,300
<font color="yellow">I don't know why,</font>

1006
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,970
<font color="yellow">but my heart was pounding while I was waiting for you.</font>

1007
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,000
<font color="yellow">If your heart doesn't pound for a woman like me,</font>

1008
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,770
<font color="yellow">that means something's wrong with you.</font>

1009
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,700
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to tell you this,</font>

1010
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,800
<font color="yellow">but I felt the same way.</font>

1011
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,070
<font color="yellow">I never felt this way when we were living together.</font>

1012
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,070
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do? I feel like I'm cheating.</font>

1013
01:04:58,670 --> 01:04:59,970
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Pour me a glass.</font>

1020
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,570

1021
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:47,400

<font color="yellow">Is marriage even possible?</font>

1031
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,470
<font color="yellow">I can never let her marry you.</font>

1032
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,440
