00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:06,271
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 46)</font>

3
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:09,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you listening?</font>

4
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:12,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's meet right now. I beg you.</font>

5
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:20,493
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

6
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to try on another wedding gown?</font>

7
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,823
<font color=#FFFF00>This one looks great on you, too.</font>

8
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:27,723
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take this.</font>

9
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:30,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go back to work now.</font>

10
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:31,553
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a meeting.</font>

11
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:34,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Call me later.</font>

12
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:39,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

13
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you calling me?</font>

14
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:44,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to tell you something in person. Let's meet right now.</font>

15
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:48,853
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I don't think we need to meet.</font>

16
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:52,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Just this once. I beg you.</font>

17
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:55,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm begging you.</font>

18
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:58,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't ever call me again.</font>

19
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye.</font>

20
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:28,053
<font color=#FFFF00>As you allow the foam roller to roll up your calf,</font>

21
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:30,223
<font color=#FFFF00>you can stretch out your leg.</font>

22
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,293
<font color=#FFFF00>When you come up,</font>

23
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,093
<font color=#FFFF00>you can reverse the motion...</font>

24
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:38,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

25
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,453
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so mean.</font>

26
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:43,253
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you said you wouldn't do this any more.</font>

27
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:46,053
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know what you're talking about. I'm not doing anything bad.</font>

28
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:48,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm getting ready for the US.</font>

29
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to find work when I get there.</font>

30
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:52,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stay home without doing anything.</font>

31
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:55,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't like you doing this. This looks ludicrous.</font>

32
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:58,623
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on? Why are you arguing?</font>

33
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:00,353
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not arguing.</font>

34
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I argue with my niece?</font>

35
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:03,853
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm reprimanding her.</font>

36
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:07,053
<font color=#FFFF00>She was recording herself to upload on the internet.</font>

37
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:09,163
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this again?</font>

38
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:10,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Haven't you learned your lesson?</font>

39
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:12,993
<font color=#FFFF00>These days, people want to exercise...</font>

40
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:15,163
<font color=#FFFF00>at home without spending too much time or money.</font>

41
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:16,893
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing home training.</font>

42
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:19,593
<font color=#FFFF00>I uploaded few clips, and they are drawing a lot of attention.</font>

43
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:21,163
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone's watching my videos.</font>

44
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:24,753
<font color=#FFFF00>If you do anything foolish again, I will not put up with it.</font>

45
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

46
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:29,353
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you're going to the US to check out the schools.</font>

47
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:31,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I'm taking the first flight out tomorrow.</font>

48
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:34,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care of the children without getting into arguments.</font>

49
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:36,693
<font color=#FFFF00>(Witness Interrogation)</font>

50
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:40,493
<font color=#FFFF00>You are being questioned as a witness, so don't worry.</font>

51
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Just answer our questions.</font>

52
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

53
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:47,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang.</font>

54
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:51,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am.</font>

55
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:54,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you supposed to be in China?</font>

56
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:56,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I came back today.</font>

57
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,493
<font color=#FFFF00>That was a short trip.</font>

58
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:00,323
<font color=#FFFF00>China is so close.</font>

59
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:02,253
<font color=#FFFF00>I took care of the business and came right back.</font>

60
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:03,993
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

61
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have business to take care of?</font>

62
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,593
<font color=#FFFF00>The chief of the station is my friend. I just stopped by to say hi.</font>

63
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:17,123
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's friends with the chief? - That's right.</font>

64
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess being in business allows him to meet a lot of people.</font>

65
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:21,053
<font color=#FFFF00>He knows so many people.</font>

66
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:27,023
<font color=#FFFF00>People who were conned are preparing to sue him.</font>

67
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,993
<font color=#FFFF00>There are a lot of people who are angry at him.</font>

68
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Why were you at the police station?</font>

69
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:43,053
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing to be concerned about? Are you sure?</font>

70
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:44,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I'm concerned.</font>

71
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,053
<font color=#FFFF00>You have, after all, criminal...</font>

72
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,293
<font color=#FFFF00>About the children...</font>

73
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:52,453
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

74
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:53,623
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you hiding?</font>

75
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:56,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not hiding anything. I was talking on the phone.</font>

76
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:59,523
<font color=#FFFF00>You said something about criminals. Whom were you talking about?</font>

77
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:00,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

78
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:03,293
<font color=#FFFF00>It's someone I know. What about the children?</font>

79
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,693
<font color=#FFFF00>You know someone with a criminal record?</font>

80
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:08,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I know people of all different kinds.</font>

81
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:10,653
<font color=#FFFF00>People with criminal records and gang members.</font>

82
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Just hearing about them scares me.</font>

83
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:15,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to talk about the children.</font>

84
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:18,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Before Jae Soon gets married,</font>

85
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:21,553
<font color=#FFFF00>we should formally introduce Jeon Se Bang and Gab Dol.</font>

86
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,793
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a good idea.</font>

87
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:27,393
<font color=#FFFF00>They should be formally introduced, so they can get along.</font>

88
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's make some dumplings and invite them over. I bought groceries.</font>

89
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure, Mum.</font>

90
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:35,353
<font color=#FFFF00>The kimchi tastes great, so dumplings will be delicious.</font>

91
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:38,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Gab Dol loves dumplings. He will wake up at the mentioning of it.</font>

92
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:40,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang loves dumplings, too.</font>

93
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:43,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that you mention it, our sons-in-law both love dumplings.</font>

94
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:46,093
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll make some fresh kimchi, too. - Okay.</font>

95
00:04:46,393 --> 00:04:47,693
<font color=#FFFF00>She's making dumpling soup?</font>

96
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:49,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure I get extra portions.</font>

97
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I will make the dumplings.</font>

98
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,123
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you going to your in-laws? - Yes.</font>

99
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:58,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that not allowed?</font>

100
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, it's not that.</font>

101
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:02,893
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be careful so that you won't have any trouble.</font>

102
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:07,123
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please revise this report. - Okay.</font>

103
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,123
<font color=#FFFF00>What troubles could there be?</font>

104
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:29,923
<font color=#FFFF00>You're very good at making dumplings.</font>

105
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,453
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll have a beautiful daughter.</font>

106
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:32,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that what they say?</font>

107
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:35,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to eat all the dumplings I make.</font>

108
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:37,353
<font color=#FFFF00>I can eat dumplings all day.</font>

109
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:39,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I already told them how much you love dumplings.</font>

110
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Are the dumplings ready? The soup is boiling.</font>

111
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:44,523
<font color=#FFFF00>It's almost done thanks to Gab Dol.</font>

112
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:48,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon, your husband is here.</font>

113
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:55,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here.</font>

114
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome. You're just in time.</font>

115
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:05,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Are these diamonds?</font>

116
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,953
<font color=#FFFF00>It's her wedding present.</font>

117
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,693
<font color=#FFFF00>You are so fortunate.</font>

118
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,153
<font color=#FFFF00>They're so beautiful.</font>

119
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,353
<font color=#FFFF00>They are beautiful.</font>

120
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:18,193
<font color=#FFFF00>How much do these cost?</font>

121
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:20,023
<font color=#FFFF00>They must be very expensive.</font>

122
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,993
<font color=#FFFF00>He gave them when they first got married.</font>

123
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:23,923
<font color=#FFFF00>We sold those off long time ago.</font>

124
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:26,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I got bigger ones than those.</font>

125
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:27,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like them?</font>

126
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:29,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

127
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,553
<font color=#FFFF00>He's talking to Jae Soon, not you.</font>

128
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:33,223
<font color=#FFFF00>She feels the same way.</font>

129
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:35,093
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been through it all.</font>

130
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:39,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

131
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:42,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure? I bet you've never seen anything like these.</font>

132
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:43,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Try them on.</font>

133
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:45,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Later.</font>

134
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,323
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

135
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there anything for us?</font>

136
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:56,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Get some dumplings for your aunt.</font>

137
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am. Here's some spending money.</font>

138
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for inviting me over for dinner.</font>

139
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,693
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a special occasion.</font>

140
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:09,623
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sad that I don't have a son-in-law.</font>

141
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have anything for us, Gab Dol?</font>

142
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:14,553
<font color=#FFFF00>He made all those dumplings.</font>

143
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:18,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure, if you don't have the money, you have to at least work hard.</font>

144
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:21,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang, I will bring the dumpling soup for you.</font>

145
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:23,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want some steamed dumplings, too? You like those, right?</font>

146
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, please.</font>

147
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:27,293
<font color=#FFFF00>We may not have enough.</font>

148
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't wait to taste the dumplings.</font>

149
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:49,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give some to Gab Dol.</font>

150
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:51,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. This is too much.</font>

151
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang, have some more.</font>

152
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:58,623
<font color=#FFFF00>I made those. I can eat more.</font>

153
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I forgot the steamed dumplings.</font>

154
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:03,893
<font color=#FFFF00>You saved some for Dal Pa, right?</font>

155
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:06,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I saved some for him.</font>

156
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:09,453
<font color=#FFFF00>It's delicious.</font>

157
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

158
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,793
<font color=#FFFF00>The soup is delicious, too.</font>

159
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:21,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that you've been formally introduced, be like brothers.</font>

160
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:22,253
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Yes.</font>

161
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:26,523
<font color=#FFFF00>If you have any problems, come to me. Consider me your brother.</font>

162
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:30,593
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to get along. That'll make them happy.</font>

163
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

164
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, who's going to have a baby first?</font>

165
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:38,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Will it be you, Se Bang, or Gab Dol?</font>

166
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:41,153
<font color=#FFFF00>- I will. - No, I should.</font>

167
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,523
<font color=#FFFF00>We can do it, right?</font>

168
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:44,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Just eat your dumplings.</font>

169
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang, here.</font>

170
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:51,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dumplings are the best.</font>

171
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't flatter me. I'm glad you like them.</font>

172
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:58,063
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, can I have some more dumplings?</font>

173
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:00,693
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have made some more.</font>

174
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:02,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I made a lot of them.</font>

175
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:05,923
<font color=#FFFF00>If you didn't steam them, there would have been plenty for everyone.</font>

176
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:07,623
<font color=#FFFF00>There's one with the torn skin.</font>

177
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:10,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me your bowl. Eat this one. Here.</font>

178
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:14,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Kimchi is good, too.</font>

179
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:15,953
<font color=#FFFF00>So is the fresh kimchi.</font>

180
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,623
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? Didn't you enjoy the dumplings?</font>

181
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:26,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm mad because of the unfair treatment.</font>

182
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:27,393
<font color=#FFFF00>What's your problem?</font>

183
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:29,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you arguing again?</font>

184
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:30,823
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Mother.</font>

185
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:32,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

186
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:40,993
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me. What was so unfair?</font>

187
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:42,593
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with your family?</font>

188
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,693
<font color=#FFFF00>You're at it again. What's wrong with my family?</font>

189
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,693
<font color=#FFFF00>You always criticise my mother.</font>

190
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:48,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you mad?</font>

191
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:51,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Does your family enjoy embarrassing me?</font>

192
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:54,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Must they make me feel bad about having a fixed income?</font>

193
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:57,563
<font color=#FFFF00>Doe he have to give spending money...</font>

194
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,923
<font color=#FFFF00>in front of me, so that I would look bad?</font>

195
00:09:58,923 --> 00:10:00,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it wrong for him to give her spending money?</font>

196
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:03,563
<font color=#FFFF00>You should feel bad about not giving, not criticise him for it.</font>

197
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:06,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Furthermore, he gave the money. What did my mum do?</font>

198
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I don't have anything to say to you?</font>

199
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:12,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see Se Bang giving my sister a full set of diamonds?</font>

200
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:14,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you feel anything?</font>

201
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,093
<font color=#FFFF00>How should I feel?</font>

202
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you know about my financial situation?</font>

203
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a public official.</font>

204
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:22,323
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a limited income. What can I do?</font>

205
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:26,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you meet someone like him from the beginning, Gold Digger?</font>

206
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,423
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

207
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:30,093
<font color=#FFFF00>As soon as you saw those diamonds, you were slobbering all over it.</font>

208
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:31,323
<font color=#FFFF00>You couldn't control yourself.</font>

209
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I was just slobbering?</font>

210
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:35,853
<font color=#FFFF00>If you can take care of me like he does Jae Soon, just be quiet.</font>

211
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I worked hard instead.</font>

212
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I put aside my dad's anniversary.</font>

213
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I cleaned your house and made dumplings there.</font>

214
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:47,953
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you make me feel so cheap because of some dumplings?</font>

215
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,063
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't going to say this.</font>

216
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:53,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I was crying inside when eating those dumplings.</font>

217
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:57,393
<font color=#FFFF00>I had only three dumplings in my clear soup.</font>

218
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,593
<font color=#FFFF00>He got a load of dumplings.</font>

219
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked for some more and I was given only the torn ones.</font>

220
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I look like a beggar?</font>

221
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:06,493
<font color=#FFFF00>You weren't given torn ones.</font>

222
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:09,553
<font color=#FFFF00>You were busy eating to pay attention to me.</font>

223
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Do we need to get permission before we have a child?</font>

224
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,853
<font color=#FFFF00>We're the newly weds. We should have our child earlier.</font>

225
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:17,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't give this up no matter what.</font>

226
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I would rather speak to a dog than you.</font>

227
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,453
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I just copied what your mum said.</font>

228
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,093
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all because of you.</font>

229
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:27,493
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why women should be wise.</font>

230
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'd want to be good to your family when you're like this?</font>

231
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:32,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Who told you that? Did she say that?</font>

232
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:35,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it's what Young Ran told me.</font>

233
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:38,723
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not even married yet she knows so much and is wise.</font>

234
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:41,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I take that back.</font>

235
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:48,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Relief Patch.</font>

236
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,353
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you up to? Did you have dinner?</font>

237
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:55,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I ate ages ago. It's late.</font>

238
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:56,853
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you eat?</font>

239
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:59,593
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a bite of kimchi stew.</font>

240
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,753
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to eat well.</font>

241
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,953
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want to eat? Should I buy you meat?</font>

242
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want some short rib soup?</font>

243
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:13,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Relief Patch. I miss you so much.</font>

244
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:15,853
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad. - Where's the relief patch?</font>

245
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:18,723
<font color=#FFFF00>- I need to get some relief patch. - Relief patch?</font>

246
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:19,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

247
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

248
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:27,393
<font color=#FFFF00>That's where it was.</font>

249
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,793
<font color=#FFFF00>- I missed you. - What?</font>

250
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:32,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come?</font>

251
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,893
<font color=#FFFF00>I forgot because you were looking for this.</font>

252
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:36,253
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come back later.</font>

253
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:47,353
<font color=#FFFF00>We nearly got caught.</font>

254
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:50,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful. Don't say strange things.</font>

255
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,023
<font color=#FFFF00>What strange things?</font>

256
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:55,253
<font color=#FFFF00>That you miss me or that you want to be next to me.</font>

257
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:56,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

258
00:12:57,753 --> 00:13:01,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop calling me. I'm not going to work at the restaurant.</font>

259
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,993
<font color=#FFFF00>I refused but they keep calling me.</font>

260
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,223
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you need?</font>

261
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:08,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I need some relief patch.</font>

262
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,723
<font color=#FFFF00>I bumped my leg. It hurts.</font>

263
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:12,353
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so bothersome.</font>

264
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Buy some yourself and have some in your room.</font>

265
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:17,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you laugh just a minute ago.</font>

266
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,753
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

267
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:22,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Knock before you enter my room.</font>

268
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:23,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Why all of a sudden?</font>

269
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:26,923
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? You should. You're married now.</font>

270
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:29,753
<font color=#FFFF00>What does that have to do with knocking?</font>

271
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,353
<font color=#FFFF00>How about some beer?</font>

272
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to sleep early. Go to bed.</font>

273
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a third wheel everywhere.</font>

274
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,893
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to go. I need to sleep.</font>

275
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:08,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

276
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:12,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Our director's here. Come and say hello.</font>

277
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for your work.</font>

278
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Working at the warehouse seems to be the toughest job.</font>

279
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for your hard work.</font>

280
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:23,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Please keep up the good work.</font>

281
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:26,523
<font color=#FFFF00>If we were discourteous before,</font>

282
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,493
<font color=#FFFF00>please be understanding.</font>

283
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:30,423
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't know you were the president's grandson.</font>

284
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:33,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't mind who has power. Please act according to your conviction.</font>

285
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:21,523
<font color=#FFFF00>What are these? Who are all these ladies?</font>

286
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Soo Jo's prospective brides.</font>

287
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

288
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:26,923
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't know.</font>

289
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:28,723
<font color=#FFFF00>A woman knows women best.</font>

290
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,353
<font color=#FFFF00>I know women.</font>

291
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone who doesn't live in a room...</font>

292
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:33,793
<font color=#FFFF00>has a high school diploma and is kind?</font>

293
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:35,223
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not enough.</font>

294
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:38,723
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you would discuss this with me. I'm disappointed.</font>

295
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:41,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Since I mean nothing, you don't want me to be a part of this.</font>

296
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:43,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

297
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:23,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave out the girls who had their pictures edited.</font>

298
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:27,093
<font color=#FFFF00>If I'm surprised by their actual faces, I won't be able to sleep.</font>

299
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, the girl who made her eyes look bigger and lips smaller.</font>

300
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,623
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to leave out the ones who should be left out.</font>

301
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,493
<font color=#FFFF00>You understand, right?</font>

302
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Highlight that.</font>

303
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:40,093
<font color=#FFFF00>What are we having for dinner?</font>

304
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:47,953
<font color=#FFFF00>(Goodbye)</font>

305
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye.</font>

306
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor. Professor.</font>

307
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:59,623
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where are you going? - Let go.</font>

308
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:04,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not needed here. I'm leaving.</font>

309
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:07,123
<font color=#FFFF00>You have nowhere to go. Why are you like this?</font>

310
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:09,993
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do everything on your own. Why did you come to get me?</font>

311
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:12,453
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me to butt out of Soo Jo's marriage.</font>

312
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:14,293
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need for me to be here.</font>

313
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:17,763
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go in. Let's go inside and talk.</font>

314
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,923
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need for that. I'm leaving.</font>

315
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,763
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on. Before Soo Jo comes.</font>

316
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:35,923
<font color=#FFFF00>These are my bowls.</font>

317
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Here. Look. Did this make you that upset?</font>

318
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:44,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Women need to be observed carefully by another woman.</font>

319
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:46,923
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to show you after I saw them first.</font>

320
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:49,693
<font color=#FFFF00>They're pretty.</font>

321
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:53,293
<font color=#FFFF00>She's pretty as well as her.</font>

322
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:54,993
<font color=#FFFF00>They're all pretty.</font>

323
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:57,123
<font color=#FFFF00>See. I told you that you wouldn't know.</font>

324
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to say you're leaving again?</font>

325
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't.</font>

326
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:03,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't tell Soo Jo. He'll get angry.</font>

327
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:05,923
<font color=#FFFF00>- Highlight that. - I'll highlight that.</font>

328
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,553
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't tell him.</font>

329
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:10,293
<font color=#FFFF00>He'll get angry at me, too.</font>

330
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:15,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome. Please come this way.</font>

331
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:32,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you we can go to a Chinese restaurant in a hotel.</font>

332
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:34,493
<font color=#FFFF00>This place makes the best jjajangmyeon</font>

333
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want jjajangmyeon?</font>

334
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:39,993
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll have two bowls of jjajangmyeon.</font>

335
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:41,763
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want Tangsuyuk as well?</font>

336
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't eat all that. I'm fine with just jjajangmyeon.</font>

337
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:56,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing's eternal.</font>

338
00:18:57,823 --> 00:19:00,393
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't know how we'll change.</font>

339
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,953
<font color=#FFFF00>You or I might change our minds.</font>

340
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:05,623
<font color=#FFFF00>But before that happens, let's love each other...</font>

341
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,823
<font color=#FFFF00>and take care of each other.</font>

342
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:12,053
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're such a player. - Why?</font>

343
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:15,993
<font color=#FFFF00>If there's a contest in making women's hearts flutter, you'll win.</font>

344
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:18,423
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because I met you.</font>

345
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:21,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not a man who usually says these things. I didn't laugh.</font>

346
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:25,723
<font color=#FFFF00>After I met you, I changed a lot.</font>

347
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,523
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

348
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,053
<font color=#FFFF00>- Kiss. - No.</font>

349
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:37,763
<font color=#FFFF00>Who cares? Young people these days do it.</font>

350
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:40,453
<font color=#FFFF00>On the streets or in the subway. They don't mind.</font>

351
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,223
<font color=#FFFF00>We're from the Dongsan District Office.</font>

352
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,423
<font color=#FFFF00>We're on an inspection.</font>

353
00:19:57,693 --> 00:19:59,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give us a second. We're in the middle of cooking.</font>

354
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let us finish.</font>

355
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:06,623
<font color=#FFFF00>You weren't given dumplings at your in-laws?</font>

356
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:08,393
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

357
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:10,093
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have been upset.</font>

358
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:14,123
<font color=#FFFF00>It must hurt when you're being compared with a rich man.</font>

359
00:20:14,553 --> 00:20:17,693
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother tries hard not to compare her sons-in-law.</font>

360
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:22,223
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why women need to be wise.</font>

361
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:29,493
<font color=#FFFF00>You came all this way.</font>

362
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:32,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. You must work here.</font>

363
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,153
<font color=#FFFF00>You know.</font>

364
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:36,723
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have called me.</font>

365
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:39,653
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels awkward to see each other at work.</font>

366
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,993
<font color=#FFFF00>We see each other at work.</font>

367
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you're here anyway, please have a seat.</font>

368
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:47,453
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better get going.</font>

369
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,993
<font color=#FFFF00>You wouldn't want to be the third wheel.</font>

370
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:51,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you we're here for the sanitary checkup.</font>

371
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,523
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what you say,</font>

372
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:55,263
<font color=#FFFF00>but I know you're here to see me.</font>

373
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:57,923
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

374
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,823
<font color=#FFFF00>How about...</font>

375
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,693
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I can ever commit a crime.</font>

376
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,223
<font color=#FFFF00>They almost got us.</font>

377
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,423
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too dangerous to hang out in this neighbourhood.</font>

378
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:12,763
<font color=#FFFF00>My son is everywhere.</font>

379
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:14,653
<font color=#FFFF00>We should go to a different neighbourhood.</font>

380
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,693
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do this any more.</font>

381
00:21:16,823 --> 00:21:18,853
<font color=#FFFF00>When can we stop sneaking around?</font>

382
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:20,623
<font color=#FFFF00>I blame my children.</font>

383
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:28,263
<font color=#FFFF00>(Cho Rok National University Hospital)</font>

384
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,493
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? What happened?</font>

385
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:49,263
<font color=#FFFF00>Please help me.</font>

386
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:51,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to get back together with Se Gye.</font>

387
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,493
<font color=#FFFF00>My mum messed everything up.</font>

388
00:21:57,593 --> 00:22:00,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I wasn't caring enough.</font>

389
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:02,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I should see Se Gye sometime.</font>

390
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:04,893
<font color=#FFFF00>What did he say?</font>

391
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:07,953
<font color=#FFFF00>He doesn't even let me see him. He doesn't answer my call either.</font>

392
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Please do something.</font>

393
00:22:12,423 --> 00:22:16,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandpa, this is killing me.</font>

394
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come here right after the medical service?</font>

395
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:28,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

396
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:30,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you not even stop by at home?</font>

397
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:33,423
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I wanted to see you.</font>

398
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:36,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't make such jokes.</font>

399
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:40,353
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while since I ate here.</font>

400
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,253
<font color=#FFFF00>What a gentleman.</font>

401
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:46,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Try. It'll taste amazing.</font>

402
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:54,353
<font color=#FFFF00>It does taste good. It's seasoned perfectly.</font>

403
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:55,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you like it sour.</font>

404
00:22:58,553 --> 00:23:00,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been thinking about what you said earlier.</font>

405
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it a proposal?</font>

406
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,723
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? I don't think I said something special.</font>

407
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,723
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you won't let me see other women.</font>

408
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:16,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you say you'll get jealous if I see other women?</font>

409
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,223
<font color=#FFFF00>When did I say that?</font>

410
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:21,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

411
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it'd sound cool,</font>

412
00:23:25,193 --> 00:23:27,553
<font color=#FFFF00>but it doesn't at all when you say it like that.</font>

413
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,653
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the point though.</font>

414
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:32,453
<font color=#FFFF00>It's time to eat naengmyeon.</font>

415
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:45,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no. I flipped it too early.</font>

416
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:48,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to eat that. It looks ugly now.</font>

417
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:51,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not cooking for you.</font>

418
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:55,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder who that could be.</font>

419
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:56,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

420
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:01,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

421
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,693
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me. - Who are you?</font>

422
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:10,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

423
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:13,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Joong Nyeon, come out.</font>

424
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:14,723
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

425
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,023
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

426
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I apologise for the sudden visit.</font>

427
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:27,723
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it's not appropriate, but I had to come.</font>

428
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:30,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you wouldn't answer if I called you.</font>

429
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:33,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Good to hear that you know that. We have nothing to talk about.</font>

430
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:35,093
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

431
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:37,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you're here anyway, please have a seat.</font>

432
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:38,593
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to talk about?</font>

433
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:42,193
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you want some tea? - No, thank you.</font>

434
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:50,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you have a seat as well?</font>

435
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

436
00:25:00,823 --> 00:25:04,453
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've taken better care of my family.</font>

437
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:08,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I was recently too sick to take care of the situation.</font>

438
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:11,693
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not interested. Since you're here anyway,</font>

439
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:14,093
<font color=#FFFF00>you can say what you have in mind and leave.</font>

440
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:19,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to see your family.</font>

441
00:25:19,193 --> 00:25:22,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Could you please reconsider for our children's sake?</font>

442
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:25,323
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

443
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you get it? He wants them to get back together.</font>

444
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,593
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not going to happen. Please leave.</font>

445
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:37,853
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand you're hurt. I feel sorry for Se Gye as well.</font>

446
00:25:38,923 --> 00:25:42,723
<font color=#FFFF00>This time, I'll get them a flat so that they can live alone.</font>

447
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:46,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard Se Gye volunteers for medical service. It must be tough.</font>

448
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:48,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm thinking of getting him a hospital business.</font>

449
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:50,253
<font color=#FFFF00>A hospital?</font>

450
00:25:50,253 --> 00:25:51,423
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not interested.</font>

451
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:53,223
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a hospital.</font>

452
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,953
<font color=#FFFF00>They're already over. There's no need to talk more about it.</font>

453
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:00,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Please leave.</font>

454
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Please have some pity on the old man's apology.</font>

455
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:06,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Could you please reconsider it for the children's sake?</font>

456
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:08,193
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better leave.</font>

457
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:11,523
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mal Nyeon. - Yes.</font>

458
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:13,093
<font color=#FFFF00>- Flip the pancake. - Okay.</font>

459
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:24,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you kick him out just like that?</font>

460
00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:26,293
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing more to listen to.</font>

461
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,923
<font color=#FFFF00>What else did you want to hear from him?</font>

462
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:29,893
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason why they had problems was...</font>

463
00:26:29,893 --> 00:26:32,053
<font color=#FFFF00>because they were living with the entire family.</font>

464
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,093
<font color=#FFFF00>If he lets them live alone...</font>

465
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

466
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Their marriage isn't registered, but they're a married couple.</font>

467
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,993
<font color=#FFFF00>It could be better than breaking up.</font>

468
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:39,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Enough.</font>

469
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:41,823
<font color=#FFFF00>It's tempting that he offered a hospital, isn't it?</font>

470
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:44,023
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to take advantage of your son again, don't you?</font>

471
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:46,223
<font color=#FFFF00>If possible, why not?</font>

472
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:49,193
<font color=#FFFF00>It's better than looking poor.</font>

473
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:53,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about how desperate he was. He even wants to get him a hospital.</font>

474
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:55,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop using your son.</font>

475
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,223
<font color=#FFFF00>I never said this before,</font>

476
00:26:57,753 --> 00:27:00,193
<font color=#FFFF00>but I have been feeling bad for Se Gye.</font>

477
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I've always been feeling guilty.</font>

478
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:07,523
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been always bothering me that we forced him to get married...</font>

479
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:09,223
<font color=#FFFF00>when he was so unhappy about it.</font>

480
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:11,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried to tell myself...</font>

481
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:13,093
<font color=#FFFF00>that it's for his own sake.</font>

482
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:17,593
<font color=#FFFF00>We should let him live his life.</font>

483
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:19,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop bothering him.</font>

484
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:22,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want him to choose the easier way. It's not for myself.</font>

485
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not pretentious any more.</font>

486
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really not.</font>

487
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:28,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Humans don't need to eat much.</font>

488
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:30,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Do we eat 10 or 20 meals a day?</font>

489
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:33,293
<font color=#FFFF00>If you let go of your greed,</font>

490
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,523
<font color=#FFFF00>you don't need millions of dollars.</font>

491
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,623
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need so much money to feed yourself.</font>

492
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to eat meat every meal.</font>

493
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:42,223
<font color=#FFFF00>We need more than just some food to live. We need to wear clothes, too.</font>

494
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:44,753
<font color=#FFFF00>As long as you don't wear luxury goods only, it doesn't cost so much.</font>

495
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:47,193
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to travel abroad from time to time.</font>

496
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:48,953
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that expensive either.</font>

497
00:27:48,953 --> 00:27:51,853
<font color=#FFFF00>You think it'd cost a lot, but it's quite cheap these days.</font>

498
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:54,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not talking about going on a group tour.</font>

499
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,993
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want a luxurious vacation, it'll cost quite a lot.</font>

500
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:58,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You've never even done it.</font>

501
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying it doesn't cost so much to live a normal life.</font>

502
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:04,423
<font color=#FFFF00>His license won't go away.</font>

503
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:06,293
<font color=#FFFF00>He can make money any time he wants.</font>

504
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,993
<font color=#FFFF00>What a smooth talker.</font>

505
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:10,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Why haven't you become a lawyer?</font>

506
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm more than just a smooth talker.</font>

507
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:15,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do everything. I can even cook well.</font>

508
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:17,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Just leave...</font>

509
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:19,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Gye alone. Stop bothering him.</font>

510
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:21,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't.</font>

511
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:28,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Gye.</font>

512
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:32,323
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you here to clean? - Yes.</font>

513
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:34,223
<font color=#FFFF00>We're in charge of this building.</font>

514
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:37,323
<font color=#FFFF00>There is so much to do since spring is coming.</font>

515
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:38,923
<font color=#FFFF00>What a happy complaint.</font>

516
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:41,853
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the news.</font>

517
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:43,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you're back home.</font>

518
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:45,493
<font color=#FFFF00>It must be tough.</font>

519
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,253
<font color=#FFFF00>You look better than I imagined, though.</font>

520
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm actually doing well.</font>

521
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:55,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm finally relaxed and happy for the first time in a few years.</font>

522
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:56,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm happy to hear that.</font>

523
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:59,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go for a drink sometime. It'll be on me.</font>

524
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:00,793
<font color=#FFFF00>You know, I own a business.</font>

525
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:02,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, Ms Shin.</font>

526
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:06,593
<font color=#FFFF00>How's your marriage? Are you doing well with Gab Dol?</font>

527
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,353
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. We argue all the time.</font>

528
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:11,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I should get going.</font>

529
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Make a lot of money, Ma'am.</font>

530
00:29:21,323 --> 00:29:23,993
<font color=#FFFF00>I should get Dal Pa new clothes.</font>

531
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,423
<font color=#FFFF00>There are so many holes.</font>

532
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

533
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:32,123
<font color=#FFFF00>What a loud sigh.</font>

534
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:36,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Joong Nyeon, I'm worried she might get sick.</font>

535
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:40,123
<font color=#FFFF00>You almost got a whole hospital for free.</font>

536
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:42,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what he has in mind.</font>

537
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:44,253
<font color=#FFFF00>I also have no idea what my children think.</font>

538
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:47,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, you do. You just don't want to admit it.</font>

539
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:51,653
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm home. - Welcome home.</font>

540
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:53,523
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you have dinner? - Yes, I did.</font>

541
00:29:58,093 --> 00:29:59,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do it.</font>

542
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,053
<font color=#FFFF00>He just said, "Don't do it."</font>

543
00:30:02,723 --> 00:30:03,923
<font color=#FFFF00>What are they talking about?</font>

544
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:08,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone wants to set up a hospital for you.</font>

545
00:30:09,223 --> 00:30:10,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Who?</font>

546
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:12,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you meet Mr Yeo?</font>

547
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:15,493
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think of getting back together with Gong Joo?</font>

548
00:30:15,493 --> 00:30:18,293
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he'd get you a new flat to live alone...</font>

549
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:19,693
<font color=#FFFF00>and even a hospital.</font>

550
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you meet him?</font>

551
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:24,693
<font color=#FFFF00>He just visited us without notice.</font>

552
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,453
<font color=#FFFF00>We couldn't just kick him out.</font>

553
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't meet him again.</font>

554
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:33,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you're a doctor now,</font>

555
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:36,053
<font color=#FFFF00>it'll be better to live with a little pride.</font>

556
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:38,353
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm already living with pride.</font>

557
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:40,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to get changed.</font>

558
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he kick you out?</font>

559
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:47,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Serves you right.</font>

560
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Pick 5 out of 10.</font>

561
00:30:57,453 --> 00:30:58,623
<font color=#FFFF00>How's this one?</font>

562
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:02,053
<font color=#FFFF00>She's pretty.</font>

563
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:05,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Take a good look.</font>

564
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:09,293
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think about her besides being pretty?</font>

565
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:12,493
<font color=#FFFF00>- She looks smart... - Doesn't she look snobby?</font>

566
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:14,293
<font color=#FFFF00>She's disqualified.</font>

567
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,893
<font color=#FFFF00>What about this one?</font>

568
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:20,453
<font color=#FFFF00>She's pretty.</font>

569
00:31:21,523 --> 00:31:22,753
<font color=#FFFF00>She looks like a nice girl.</font>

570
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:25,523
<font color=#FFFF00>She looks pretentious. She's disqualified.</font>

571
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:28,023
<font color=#FFFF00>What about her?</font>

572
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:33,893
<font color=#FFFF00>It's getting hot all of a sudden.

573
00:31:34,823 --> 00:31:36,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not.</font>

574
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:40,293
<font color=#FFFF00>- Would you like some water? - I don't need any.</font>

575
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:44,823
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

576
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:48,353
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so happy that you're here.</font>

577
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:50,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Gong Joo not home yet?</font>

578
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:51,823
<font color=#FFFF00>She's late all the time these days.</font>

579
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:53,323
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm waiting for the right moment to talk to her.</font>

580
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't scold her. Just watch her.</font>

581
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:57,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did you go earlier?</font>

582
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:58,693
<font color=#FFFF00>That's none of your business.</font>

583
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you choose one?</font>

584
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't. They're all pretty.</font>

585
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:07,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm back.</font>

586
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,253
<font color=#FFFF00>- Welcome back. - You're back.</font>

587
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:10,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here and have a seat.</font>

588
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,723
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been hearing that you're working hard.</font>

589
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,093
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm proud of you.</font>

590
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't Soo Jo great?</font>

591
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:28,823
<font color=#FFFF00>So I'd like to propose that you get married early.</font>

592
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:31,923
<font color=#FFFF00>- Marriage? - You'll be more stable that way.</font>

593
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,893
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll be able to focus on work, too.</font>

594
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,753
<font color=#FFFF00>We looked at a few prospects.</font>

595
00:32:35,893 --> 00:32:39,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you choose your favourites from these?</font>

596
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:41,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going on any blind dates.</font>

597
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:42,493
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why not? - Why not?</font>

598
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:44,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you seeing someone?</font>

599
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:47,893
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not. He's never dated anyone before.</font>

600
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:49,093
<font color=#FFFF00>He's like me.</font>

601
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:52,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Work is busy and I'm not ready to get married yet.</font>

602
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:09,623
<font color=#FFFF00>It's coming.</font>

603
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,593
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going. See you next week.</font>

604
00:33:13,923 --> 00:33:14,953
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

605
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:51,623
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is he asleep? - He just fell asleep.</font>

606
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:54,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Nae Shim?</font>

607
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:56,923
<font color=#FFFF00>She left for the supermarket earlier.</font>

608
00:33:57,553 --> 00:33:59,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to talk to you for a second.</font>

609
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Why were you at the police station?</font>

610
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure the chief of police is your friend?</font>

611
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:07,423
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you already.</font>

612
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,523
<font color=#FFFF00>It's still bothering me.</font>

613
00:34:10,753 --> 00:34:13,853
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you were closing your business. Did you take care of it?</font>

614
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

615
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:18,023
<font color=#FFFF00>From what I hear,</font>

616
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,423
<font color=#FFFF00>your investors are planning to sue you for fraud...</font>

617
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:23,593
<font color=#FFFF00>and stir up some trouble.</font>

618
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:26,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said that?</font>

619
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:27,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it? Let me meet them.</font>

620
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:30,123
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not necessary.</font>

621
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:32,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Just tell me the truth.</font>

622
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:34,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

623
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:37,893
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Se Bang. What fraud?</font>

624
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm focusing on growing my business with investment. What do you mean?</font>

625
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:45,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Those people can't wait so they're saying nonsense.</font>

626
00:34:45,423 --> 00:34:47,193
<font color=#FFFF00>That's your point of view.</font>

627
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:50,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't run a business so you don't know, right?</font>

628
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,023
<font color=#FFFF00>In business,</font>

629
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:55,793
<font color=#FFFF00>investments don't always turn into profit right away.</font>

630
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,953
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to reinvest your capitals and work for it.</font>

631
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:02,853
<font color=#FFFF00>It takes time to return the profits to the investors.</font>

632
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:06,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Those people are just impatient.</font>

633
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,893
<font color=#FFFF00>What if you end up in jail again?</font>

634
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:25,853
<font color=#FFFF00>You're an ex-convict.</font>

635
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,323
<font color=#FFFF00>What if you get sentenced again?</font>

636
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:33,663
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you talking about? - When did you...</font>

637
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:36,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Who will get sentenced? Who's an ex-convict?</font>

638
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:37,793
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you get back?</font>

639
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:40,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you an ex-convict?</font>

640
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:42,993
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not. That's not what we were saying.</font>

641
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:45,223
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm not, Mother. - Tell me the truth.</font>

642
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:46,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

643
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:51,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Something went wrong with his business before.</font>

644
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:53,193
<font color=#FFFF00>He was confined...</font>

645
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:55,693
<font color=#FFFF00>for fraud.</font>

646
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:59,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me exactly. Does that mean...</font>

647
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:02,193
<font color=#FFFF00>he was imprisoned? Is that what it is?</font>

648
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:07,723
<font color=#FFFF00>It is.</font>

649
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:10,453
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew something was wrong.</font>

650
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:12,663
<font color=#FFFF00>We processed Ddol Ee's documents...</font>

651
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,253
<font color=#FFFF00>when he was in prison.</font>

652
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:21,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Father visited me.</font>

653
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,663
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you hide it from me?</font>

654
00:36:23,793 --> 00:36:25,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me.</font>

655
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:27,093
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you thinking?</font>

656
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:30,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. It won't happen again.</font>

657
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:34,023
<font color=#FFFF00>When you watch on television, company CEOs serve time.</font>

658
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:35,953
<font color=#FFFF00>They're all ex-convicts.</font>

659
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:37,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that supposed to comfort me?</font>

660
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:40,663
<font color=#FFFF00>What if Jae Soon finds out? How can an ex-convict...</font>

661
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:44,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't call me an ex-convict. I'm not a petty criminal.</font>

662
00:36:44,693 --> 00:36:47,163
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't end up in prison any more.</font>

663
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:48,663
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you be so sure?</font>

664
00:36:48,723 --> 00:36:52,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Trust me. I'm not in trouble with the law.</font>

665
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:54,223
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take care of everything.</font>

666
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:55,923
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't approve of this marriage.</font>

667
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:57,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

668
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,953
<font color=#FFFF00>My daughter may be a widow for life,</font>

669
00:37:00,023 --> 00:37:03,053
<font color=#FFFF00>but I won't make her take care of an ex-convict. There's nothing more.</font>

670
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:06,623
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want Jae Soon to suffer any more.</font>

671
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:10,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want her to send you food while you're in prison?</font>

672
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:13,253
<font color=#FFFF00>It's much better that she works at the supermarket all her life.</font>

673
00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:15,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm finished. You can leave.</font>

674
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:36,423
<font color=#FFFF00>- You know... - You're no different!</font>

675
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:40,993
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon made mistakes but did you want to get rid of her so badly?</font>

676
00:37:41,223 --> 00:37:43,193
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have told me at least.</font>

677
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:45,853
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you hide it from me?</font>

678
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:49,523
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not his fault.</font>

679
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:51,093
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all in the past.</font>

680
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:53,953
<font color=#FFFF00>If I end up serving time again,</font>

681
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:57,163
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll leave enough to feed Jae Soon for the rest of her life.</font>

682
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:59,053
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what rich CEOs do.</font>

683
00:37:59,323 --> 00:38:01,693
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't make her suffer.</font>

684
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:16,023
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you come?</font>

685
00:38:17,453 --> 00:38:19,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there something going on that I don't know about?</font>

686
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, there is.</font>

687
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,493
<font color=#FFFF00>You can stay for dinner.</font>

688
00:38:23,523 --> 00:38:25,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I have an urgent meeting to attend.</font>

689
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:29,693
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm busy trying to wrap things up before our honeymoon. I'll leave.</font>

690
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:31,163
<font color=#FFFF00>Drive safely.</font>

691
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:41,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it so quiet?</font>

692
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:43,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something going on?</font>

693
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:45,223
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

694
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:10,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I end up serving time again,</font>

695
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:13,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll leave enough to feed Jae Soon for the rest of her life.</font>

696
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,723
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't make her suffer.</font>

697
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:25,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going?</font>

698
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,893
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think we should do?</font>

699
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:46,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Gye said no.</font>

700
00:39:47,323 --> 00:39:50,163
<font color=#FFFF00>Did they convince you over buying him a hospital?</font>

701
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:52,393
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm talking about Jae Soon, not Se Gye.</font>

702
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:01,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought about it.</font>

703
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:03,393
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought about her life.</font>

704
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,593
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how she'll be able to survive from now on.</font>

705
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:11,393
<font color=#FFFF00>She graduated from college but she has no practical skills.</font>

706
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:13,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Nobody will hire her.</font>

707
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:16,193
<font color=#FFFF00>You need money to start a business.</font>

708
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:21,453
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not outgoing so she won't be able to approach people.</font>

709
00:40:21,893 --> 00:40:23,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I can see her future.</font>

710
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:26,253
<font color=#FFFF00>She's going to work at the supermarket...</font>

711
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:30,693
<font color=#FFFF00>and earn just enough to feed herself with her pay.</font>

712
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:33,053
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll get old like that.</font>

713
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,823
<font color=#FFFF00>We won't be healthy forever.</font>

714
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,093
<font color=#FFFF00>We can barely take care of ourselves.</font>

715
00:40:41,993 --> 00:40:45,453
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't look after Jae Soon and Ddol Ee all for our lives.</font>

716
00:40:46,323 --> 00:40:47,453
<font color=#FFFF00>And we can't...</font>

717
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:52,323
<font color=#FFFF00>send her to a guy who might go to jail, either.</font>

718
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so upset.</font>

719
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:03,623
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want to do?</font>

720
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:08,693
<font color=#FFFF00>What about you?</font>

721
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:11,663
<font color=#FFFF00>How about...</font>

722
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:14,953
<font color=#FFFF00>telling Jae Soon the truth?</font>

723
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,353
<font color=#FFFF00>She can decide.</font>

724
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:19,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Since she was already looking for excuses,</font>

725
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:21,693
<font color=#FFFF00>she'll leave Se Bang.</font>

726
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:25,053
<font color=#FFFF00>And she'll make a ridiculous decision to go to see Geum Sik.</font>

727
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:29,423
<font color=#FFFF00>With Geum Sik and his children,</font>

728
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,753
<font color=#FFFF00>she'd probably lead an awful life.</font>

729
00:41:32,353 --> 00:41:34,353
<font color=#FFFF00>She'd live poorly all her life.</font>

730
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:53,223
<font color=#FFFF00>I made a decision.</font>

731
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:59,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's send her to Se Bang.</font>

732
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:02,123
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not going to jail right now.</font>

733
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,663
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he won't any more.</font>

734
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if he does,</font>

735
00:42:08,953 --> 00:42:11,423
<font color=#FFFF00>he said he'd leave money for Jae Soon.</font>

736
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:13,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Just like CEOs of conglomerates.</font>

737
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:18,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang would be better than Geum Sik who is penniless.</font>

738
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:31,393
<font color=#FFFF00>At least, Se Bang won't let her starve.</font>

739
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:36,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang is not a person who will live alone.</font>

740
00:42:36,823 --> 00:42:39,023
<font color=#FFFF00>He'll live with any woman even if it's not Jae Soon.</font>

741
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Then Jae Soon will have no place to go back to.</font>

742
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:46,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Since he carries CEO business cards...</font>

743
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:47,853
<font color=#FFFF00>and has an imported car,</font>

744
00:42:48,393 --> 00:42:51,523
<font color=#FFFF00>many women will cling onto him even if he is a swindler.</font>

745
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:56,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's make him promise that he won't do anything wrong again.</font>

746
00:42:57,163 --> 00:42:58,823
<font color=#FFFF00>We have no other choice.</font>

747
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:06,693
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

748
00:43:08,323 --> 00:43:10,393
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's think this is her destiny...</font>

749
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:14,353
<font color=#FFFF00>and go with that.</font>

750
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum, are you in there?</font>

751
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,253
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's me.</font>

752
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:08,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been at this hour?</font>

753
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:11,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Weren't you sleeping?</font>

754
00:44:13,123 --> 00:44:16,393
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a drink with your dad...</font>

755
00:44:16,393 --> 00:44:17,623
<font color=#FFFF00>at a cart bar.</font>

756
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:19,293
<font color=#FFFF00>A cart bar?</font>

757
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Is something wrong?</font>

758
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:23,923
<font color=#FFFF00>- No. - Just because.</font>

759
00:44:23,923 --> 00:44:25,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that you're getting married, we were happy.</font>

760
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:30,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Since it was bittersweet, we had a drink...</font>

761
00:44:30,223 --> 00:44:31,853
<font color=#FFFF00>and talked about you when you were young.</font>

762
00:44:37,623 --> 00:44:38,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to sleep.</font>

763
00:44:43,053 --> 00:44:44,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

764
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:46,123
<font color=#FFFF00>- Aunt. - What?</font>

765
00:44:46,953 --> 00:44:49,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something going on with Mum and Dad?</font>

766
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,853
<font color=#FFFF00>They look weird these days and seem to hide something from me.</font>

767
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:57,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether I know or not, I can't tell you.</font>

768
00:44:57,853 --> 00:44:59,023
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

769
00:44:59,023 --> 00:45:03,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Though I have a mouth, I said I can't tell you about anything.</font>

770
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:06,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been through it all.</font>

771
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:09,853
<font color=#FFFF00>This is not how I expected my life to be.</font>

772
00:45:09,853 --> 00:45:11,853
<font color=#FFFF00>- That is Se Gye's room. - Oh my.</font>

773
00:45:14,793 --> 00:45:16,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I'm sleepy.</font>

774
00:45:32,253 --> 00:45:33,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Father.</font>

775
00:45:34,423 --> 00:45:35,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you now?</font>

776
00:45:37,623 --> 00:45:40,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm outside because I have a meeting.</font>

777
00:45:40,493 --> 00:45:41,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's meet for a moment.</font>

778
00:45:47,923 --> 00:45:51,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you promise that it won't happen again?</font>

779
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:53,623
<font color=#FFFF00>You can trust me.</font>

780
00:45:53,623 --> 00:45:56,853
<font color=#FFFF00>If you get investigated, you can sense something.</font>

781
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:59,493
<font color=#FFFF00>- Investigated? - Did you get investigated?</font>

782
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:01,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you won't get investigated.</font>

783
00:46:02,723 --> 00:46:05,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I got investigated as a witness.</font>

784
00:46:05,123 --> 00:46:08,123
<font color=#FFFF00>You can start as a witness but may change to a defendant later.</font>

785
00:46:08,123 --> 00:46:11,053
<font color=#FFFF00>It will never happen. I'm an expert in this.</font>

786
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:13,093
<font color=#FFFF00>The laws are not something you can manipulate easily.</font>

787
00:46:13,093 --> 00:46:14,623
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be absolutely safe.</font>

788
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:16,293
<font color=#FFFF00>You should not take others' money easily...</font>

789
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:19,223
<font color=#FFFF00>or borrow too often.</font>

790
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:21,793
<font color=#FFFF00>If you borrow money easily,</font>

791
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:24,553
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll consider money in other people's pockets as yours.</font>

792
00:46:24,553 --> 00:46:26,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't borrow tiny amounts of money...</font>

793
00:46:26,523 --> 00:46:28,053
<font color=#FFFF00>but I receive investment.</font>

794
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure you can keep your promise before?</font>

795
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:34,853
<font color=#FFFF00>You said, no matter what happens,</font>

796
00:46:35,553 --> 00:46:38,223
<font color=#FFFF00>you'd leave money for Jae Soon to use for her life.</font>

797
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:39,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure, I will.</font>

798
00:46:39,653 --> 00:46:42,023
<font color=#FFFF00>The apartment you bought recently...</font>

799
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:45,893
<font color=#FFFF00>If you get married, can you...</font>

800
00:46:46,523 --> 00:46:49,123
<font color=#FFFF00>What was it? Changing the name of the owner.</font>

801
00:46:49,523 --> 00:46:52,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't remember words these days.</font>

802
00:46:52,023 --> 00:46:54,553
<font color=#FFFF00>- Nominal transfer. - Right. Nominal transfer.</font>

803
00:46:55,193 --> 00:46:56,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you do that for her?</font>

804
00:46:57,323 --> 00:46:58,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I'll do that.</font>

805
00:46:58,893 --> 00:46:59,993
<font color=#FFFF00>Nae Shim...</font>

806
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,453
<font color=#FFFF00>can't sleep because she is so worried.</font>

807
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:05,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Please make sure...</font>

808
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,623
<font color=#FFFF00>not to let that happen again.</font>

809
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,593
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I will.</font>

810
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:17,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want me to teach you how to make your mother-in-law love you?</font>

811
00:47:18,053 --> 00:47:19,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how to do that?</font>

812
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:24,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal Pa. Dal Pa.</font>

813
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:29,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this with you. You left your phone at home.</font>

814
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,693
<font color=#FFFF00>It is still cold.</font>

815
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:34,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep yourself warm.</font>

816
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:35,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Severe cold is going around nowadays.</font>

817
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:37,653
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

818
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:40,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You should block cold wind.</font>

819
00:47:42,223 --> 00:47:43,453
<font color=#FFFF00>I said, it's okay.</font>

820
00:47:51,923 --> 00:47:54,193
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. Why are you here again?</font>

821
00:47:55,423 --> 00:47:56,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to come.</font>

822
00:47:57,523 --> 00:47:58,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is that?</font>

823
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:01,323
<font color=#FFFF00>No one.</font>

824
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:04,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you meet such a young kid like him?</font>

825
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:07,353
<font color=#FFFF00>You are talking nonsense. He's not someone like that.</font>

826
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:09,293
<font color=#FFFF00>You looked helpless in front of that young guy.</font>

827
00:48:10,453 --> 00:48:12,353
<font color=#FFFF00>He is my nephew.</font>

828
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:13,923
<font color=#FFFF00>He's my brother's son.</font>

829
00:48:13,923 --> 00:48:15,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why are you intimidated by him?</font>

830
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:19,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you borrow money from him? How much is it?</font>

831
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:21,823
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll pay it off. - Never mind.</font>

832
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:23,923
<font color=#FFFF00>Considering how you look,</font>

833
00:48:24,293 --> 00:48:26,553
<font color=#FFFF00>you don't seem to have even 100 dollars with you.</font>

834
00:48:27,553 --> 00:48:29,253
<font color=#FFFF00>We are finished.</font>

835
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:32,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Never come to see me again. Okay?</font>

836
00:48:34,253 --> 00:48:36,023
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean, we are finished?</font>

837
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:38,223
<font color=#FFFF00>We are starting from now.</font>

838
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:41,553
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to see your brother and say hello today.</font>

839
00:48:41,553 --> 00:48:43,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you crazy? What are you going to see him for?</font>

840
00:48:43,723 --> 00:48:45,093
<font color=#FFFF00>You mean nothing to me.</font>

841
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Disappear quickly before anyone sees you.</font>

842
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:48,823
<font color=#FFFF00>What if someone sees me?</font>

843
00:48:49,623 --> 00:48:52,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't you say that I'm your man?</font>

844
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:54,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You saw dramas too much.</font>

845
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:56,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ever come to see me.</font>

846
00:48:57,023 --> 00:48:59,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Sweetheart, let's begin again.</font>

847
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:00,923
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take responsibility for you.</font>

848
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:03,053
<font color=#FFFF00>You're saying ridiculous things.</font>

849
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:05,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Whom do you think you can take responsibility for?</font>

850
00:49:05,253 --> 00:49:07,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I have so many men other than you.</font>

851
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:10,123
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never run out of men.</font>

852
00:49:10,123 --> 00:49:13,193
<font color=#FFFF00>You may not have gotten married because you couldn't forget me...</font>

853
00:49:13,193 --> 00:49:17,023
<font color=#FFFF00>but I got married so many times that my family register is full.</font>

854
00:49:17,023 --> 00:49:19,853
<font color=#FFFF00>And I've had dozens of men around me.</font>

855
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,893
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't even count exactly how many there were.</font>

856
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,093
<font color=#FFFF00>So please forget someone like me.</font>

857
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:27,993
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. It's my brother.</font>

858
00:49:27,993 --> 00:49:29,753
<font color=#FFFF00>Go quickly.</font>

859
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:31,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

860
00:49:48,523 --> 00:49:50,023
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is there nobody home? - No.</font>

861
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:52,693
<font color=#FFFF00>I made fried rice with leftovers. Have some.</font>

862
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:56,753
<font color=#FFFF00>You should also forget all about her and live on your own.</font>

863
00:49:57,053 --> 00:49:58,423
<font color=#FFFF00>You met her once and that's enough, isn't it?</font>

864
00:49:59,753 --> 00:50:00,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind.</font>

865
00:50:01,453 --> 00:50:02,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I could even risk my life on her.</font>

866
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:04,693
<font color=#FFFF00>You have only one life.</font>

867
00:50:04,693 --> 00:50:06,453
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know anything about love because you haven't loved anybody.</font>

868
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:08,793
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how love should be.</font>

869
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,693
<font color=#FFFF00>You can risk all your life on it.</font>

870
00:50:11,693 --> 00:50:13,723
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what you can call love.</font>

871
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:17,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Mal Nyeon didn't meet any other men...</font>

872
00:50:17,053 --> 00:50:18,953
<font color=#FFFF00>because she liked me.</font>

873
00:50:19,553 --> 00:50:21,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Although she says harsh words to me,</font>

874
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:23,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I know she is just lying.</font>

875
00:50:24,053 --> 00:50:26,293
<font color=#FFFF00>I know her very well since I met her for as long as three months.</font>

876
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:27,993
<font color=#FFFF00>You met her only for three months.</font>

877
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:30,653
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't expect she'd betray you.</font>

878
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:34,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Even after she got married, she got divorced immediately because of me.</font>

879
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:37,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, I should take responsibility for her as a man.</font>

880
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:43,623
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be living together with Si Nae like a married couple.</font>

881
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:47,923
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like that. We've grown apart.</font>

882
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:51,323
<font color=#FFFF00>Si Nae and I are only thinking about Soo Jo.</font>

883
00:50:52,153 --> 00:50:54,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be like me and regret later.</font>

884
00:50:54,393 --> 00:50:56,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Grab her while you have the chance.</font>

885
00:50:56,393 --> 00:50:58,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Si Nae likes you, too.</font>

886
00:50:58,853 --> 00:50:59,923
<font color=#FFFF00>How?</font>

887
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Go into her room and...</font>

888
00:51:03,923 --> 00:51:05,053
<font color=#FFFF00>grab her.</font>

889
00:51:06,753 --> 00:51:07,753
<font color=#FFFF00>You rotten...</font>

890
00:51:09,123 --> 00:51:10,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Why you!</font>

891
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:11,223
<font color=#FFFF00>- Look! - What?</font>

892
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:15,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Why you rotten scoundrel!</font>

893
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:18,323
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

894
00:51:19,253 --> 00:51:21,823
<font color=#FFFF00>Open it later. I'll be leaving now.</font>

895
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:27,393
<font color=#FFFF00>- What could this be? - Isn't it money?</font>

896
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:29,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it?</font>

897
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:36,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, it's not money.</font>

898
00:51:38,653 --> 00:51:39,723
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

899
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:44,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

900
00:51:45,093 --> 00:51:46,953
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me, Gab Dol,</font>

901
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:50,323
<font color=#FFFF00>who can't even give you spending money or nice gifts.</font>

902
00:51:51,223 --> 00:51:54,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I will work hard to take care of Gab Soon...</font>

903
00:51:54,893 --> 00:51:57,853
<font color=#FFFF00>and our unborn baby well in the future.</font>

904
00:51:58,393 --> 00:51:59,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I may not have much money,</font>

905
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:03,253
<font color=#FFFF00>but if you're sick, I will be by your side taking care of you.</font>

906
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:06,353
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want to go somewhere, I will take you.</font>

907
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:10,623
<font color=#FFFF00>If you crave for something, I will go and get it for you.</font>

908
00:52:11,153 --> 00:52:12,853
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise you 3,000 percent.</font>

909
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:14,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be good to you from now and forever.</font>

910
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:17,353
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be a good son-in-law.</font>

911
00:52:18,753 --> 00:52:20,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if it's just empty promises, I'm thankful.</font>

912
00:52:21,623 --> 00:52:22,693
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you reading?</font>

913
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:26,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Read it. It's a love letter from my son-in-law.</font>

914
00:52:34,993 --> 00:52:37,053
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gab Dol did that? - Yes.</font>

915
00:52:37,623 --> 00:52:41,693
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be sad that he can't be more generous.</font>

916
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:43,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I really appreciate his thoughts.</font>

917
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:46,753
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I got a love letter.</font>

918
00:52:47,393 --> 00:52:48,823
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be happy.</font>

919
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,293
<font color=#FFFF00>When we make a lot of money, we'll give you a lot of spending money.</font>

920
00:52:52,553 --> 00:52:55,793
<font color=#FFFF00>We won't put it in an envelope. We'll put it in a big sack.</font>

921
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:57,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye, Mum.</font>

922
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:01,593
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm home.</font>

923
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,823
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the best. I love you.</font>

924
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:15,093
<font color=#FFFF00>My mum was deeply moved by your letter.</font>

925
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:16,853
<font color=#FFFF00>She said that she felt like receiving a love letter.</font>

926
00:53:17,223 --> 00:53:21,223
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you so much. How did you come up with the idea?</font>

927
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:23,693
<font color=#FFFF00>- Young Ran told... - What?</font>

928
00:53:25,323 --> 00:53:26,323
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

929
00:53:26,553 --> 00:53:29,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Be honest. Did Young Ran tell you to do it?</font>

930
00:53:29,553 --> 00:53:31,793
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. I'm going to wash up.</font>

931
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:06,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop the car, please.</font>

932
00:55:34,823 --> 00:55:36,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going somewhere?</font>

933
00:55:36,893 --> 00:55:39,823
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm coming back from the US.</font>

934
00:55:40,593 --> 00:55:41,753
<font color=#FFFF00>The US?</font>

935
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:44,053
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to go for housing...</font>

936
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:46,323
<font color=#FFFF00>and the school for my children.</font>

937
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:48,993
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

938
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:52,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have the wedding?</font>

939
00:55:53,953 --> 00:55:55,753
<font color=#FFFF00>It's this Saturday.</font>

940
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

941
00:56:02,423 --> 00:56:03,523
<font color=#FFFF00>And I'm sorry.</font>

942
00:56:08,053 --> 00:56:09,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be going now.</font>

943
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:11,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

944
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:15,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

945
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to say.</font>

946
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:25,653
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, congratulations.</font>

947
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:29,593
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold my hand just one last time.</font>

948
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:47,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Be happy.</font>

949
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:49,993
<font color=#FFFF00>You, too.</font>

950
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,553
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

951
00:58:19,153 --> 00:58:20,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

952
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:23,193
<font color=#FFFF00>Do we still have a reason to meet?</font>

953
00:58:23,353 --> 00:58:25,993
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to tell you. Please sit down.</font>

954
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:30,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I ordered my favourite drink.</font>

955
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:33,553
<font color=#FFFF00>This one's on me.</font>

956
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:40,623
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to do this. I know your financial situation.</font>

957
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:43,723
<font color=#FFFF00>It's on me. I'm celebrating my upcoming wedding.</font>

958
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:50,153
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not a patient man.</font>

959
00:58:50,723 --> 00:58:53,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me what you have to say.</font>

960
00:58:54,923 --> 00:58:56,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I would like to apologise first.</font>

961
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry about our incident at the bar.</font>

962
00:58:59,923 --> 00:59:01,223
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, I'm sorry about lying.</font>

963
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:03,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Lying?</font>

964
00:59:03,893 --> 00:59:06,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I said things out of anger.</font>

965
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly,</font>

966
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:10,793
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon has never liked me.</font>

967
00:59:11,553 --> 00:59:13,553
<font color=#FFFF00>She pretended to because of the debt and Ddol Ee.</font>

968
00:59:14,123 --> 00:59:16,893
<font color=#FFFF00>We got married purely for financial reasons.</font>

969
00:59:18,193 --> 00:59:20,093
<font color=#FFFF00>She's never warmed up to me.</font>

970
00:59:21,693 --> 00:59:24,293
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you live with her?</font>

971
00:59:25,223 --> 00:59:27,323
<font color=#FFFF00>I got remarried purely for my children, too.</font>

972
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I needed someone to take care of my household.</font>

973
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:31,653
<font color=#FFFF00>We used each other for good reasons.</font>

974
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,723
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you telling me this?</font>

975
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:43,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt bad after telling you that lie.</font>

976
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:46,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Although we met under bad circumstances,</font>

977
00:59:47,723 --> 00:59:50,023
<font color=#FFFF00>I realise you are a real man...</font>

978
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:52,223
<font color=#FFFF00>who can take care of things.</font>

979
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:55,553
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt bad that I treated you...</font>

980
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,953
<font color=#FFFF00>in such a way. I feel ashamed.</font>

981
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:05,653
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you are not a petty man...</font>

982
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,293
<font color=#FFFF00>that I once thought you were.</font>

983
01:00:09,353 --> 01:00:11,823
<font color=#FFFF00>You can admit your mistakes.</font>

984
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:15,823
<font color=#FFFF00>We could have been good friends.</font>

985
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:20,053
<font color=#FFFF00>Since I'm older, I would be a big brother to you.</font>

986
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:25,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Next time we meet, let's get along better,</font>

987
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:27,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Geum Sik.</font>

988
01:00:56,893 --> 01:00:58,353
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do it.</font>

989
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:00,023
<font color=#FFFF00>She's harassing me.</font>

990
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,493
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going on any blind dates.</font>

991
01:01:01,493 --> 01:01:03,723
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're not happy with the girl, you don't have to see her again.</font>

992
01:01:03,723 --> 01:01:06,653
<font color=#FFFF00>You never know whom you're going to meet.</font>

993
01:01:07,023 --> 01:01:09,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at me. I met your mum to defraud her...</font>

994
01:01:09,623 --> 01:01:11,693
<font color=#FFFF00>and she found you.</font>

995
01:01:13,553 --> 01:01:15,493
<font color=#FFFF00>Soo Jo.</font>

996
01:01:16,123 --> 01:01:17,153
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

997
01:01:21,453 --> 01:01:25,053
<font color=#FFFF00>He said yes. He agreed to it.</font>

998
01:01:25,053 --> 01:01:26,253
<font color=#FFFF00>He did?</font>

999
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,653
<font color=#FFFF00>See you tomorrow outside of work.</font>

1000
01:01:48,293 --> 01:01:49,793
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll buy something nice.</font>

1001
01:01:49,993 --> 01:01:51,123
<font color=#FFFF00>Where?</font>

1002
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:53,093
<font color=#FFFF00>Park at noon.</font>

1003
01:02:03,523 --> 01:02:04,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you call me a chauffeur?</font>

1004
01:02:05,393 --> 01:02:06,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure, Sir.</font>

1005
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I request a chauffeur? We're at...</font>

1006
01:02:13,623 --> 01:02:15,723
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm almost here.</font>

1007
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:22,623
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. Did you request a chauffeur?</font>

1008
01:02:22,623 --> 01:02:24,893
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. The car's at the front.</font>

1009
01:02:24,893 --> 01:02:25,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, thank you.</font>

1010
01:02:48,553 --> 01:02:50,923
<font color=#FFFF00>The chauffeur has arrived. She's out at the front.</font>

1011
01:02:51,423 --> 01:02:52,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

1012
01:03:04,623 --> 01:03:08,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Sir. Where would you like to go?</font>
