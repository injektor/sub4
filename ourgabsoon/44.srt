1
00:00:00,463 --> 00:00:06,063
<font color="yellow">BioskopKeren</font>

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,250
<font color="yellow">Then how should we share the rooms?</font>

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,650
<font color="yellow">I'll get out of this house.</font>

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,320
<font color="yellow">Why would you?</font>

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,350
<font color="yellow">You don't have to get out because of a newcomer.</font>

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,650
<font color="yellow">You are talking nonsense.</font>

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,620
<font color="yellow">Who do you call a newcomer?</font>

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,250
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, use Gab Soon's room.</font>

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,950
<font color="yellow">Even Dad doesn't have his own room. I feel uncomfortable.</font>

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,520
<font color="yellow">Then the two of us will share the room.</font>

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,280
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon and Se Gye can use the room together.</font>

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,280
<font color="yellow">And why don't you share your room with Jae Soon and Ddol Ee, Nae Shim?</font>

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,220
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep with Uncle.</font>

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,850
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep in that room with them.</font>

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,580
<font color="yellow">That room is too small for all of you.</font>

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,620
<font color="yellow">And you'll get tired because your dad snores a lot.</font>

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,450
<font color="yellow">My Dal Pa doesn't have any problem with that.</font>

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,550
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa is different from Se Gye.</font>

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,420
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa can sleep through a thunderclap.</font>

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,650
<font color="yellow">But Se Gye can't because he is sensitive.</font>

21
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,950
<font color="yellow">I am not any more, Mum.</font>

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,420
<font color="yellow">I'm okay now because I used to sleep uncomfortably at the hospital.</font>

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,480
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, use Gab Soon's room. And Mal Nyeon, come to my room.</font>

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,320
<font color="yellow">I didn't become living proof so that I would get treated like this.</font>

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,280
<font color="yellow">My goodness! I can't sleep now that I have to share the room.</font>

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,550
<font color="yellow">I'm so used to having my own room.</font>

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,580
<font color="yellow">Don't complain. You don't even have your own house.</font>

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,780
<font color="yellow">How dare you complain while living under my roof?</font>

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,880
<font color="yellow">You are lucky that you're in a nice, warm room in this cold weather.</font>

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,720
<font color="yellow">Oh, Father.</font>

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,820
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,920
<font color="yellow">Dad,</font>

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,820
<font color="yellow">can I cancel this wedding?</font>

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,550
<font color="yellow">- What? - I don't think I can do it.</font>

35
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,920
<font color="yellow">Help me out just this once, Dad.</font>

36
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,250
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is right for me.</font>

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,220
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? All these guests are waiting.</font>

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,420
<font color="yellow">If you were going to cancel, you should have done it earlier.</font>

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,750
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this? This isn't like you.</font>

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,180
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, just go through with it.</font>

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,420
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this for your benefit.</font>

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,350
<font color="yellow">Obey your father.</font>

43
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,750
<font color="yellow">That pride, pride.</font>

44
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,380
<font color="yellow">Why is it so important to show off to others?</font>

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,680
<font color="yellow">As soon as I learned how to speak, all you said was "doctor".</font>

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,320
<font color="yellow">I still don't know what I want to become.</font>

47
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,780
<font color="yellow">For the 32 years of my life,</font>

48
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,780
<font color="yellow">I lived like a robot so I don't know how to do anything.</font>

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,720
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

50
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,450
<font color="yellow">I'm getting rid of these shoulder pads.</font>

51
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,650
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,720
<font color="yellow">You're right. Who cares if I don't have these pads?</font>

53
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,920
<font color="yellow">Shoulder pads used to be in fashion, but my shoulders aren't sloped down.</font>

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,350
<font color="yellow">I don't need them.</font>

55
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,680
<font color="yellow">I don't care if shoulder pads are in fashion again. I'll never wear them.</font>

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,880
<font color="yellow">Just be patient.</font>

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,150
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you will be proud of me.</font>

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,880
<font color="yellow">It may not be because of money,</font>

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,650
<font color="yellow">but I will make you proud of me.</font>

60
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,180
<font color="yellow">Should I save these pads and put them back in later?</font>

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
<font color="yellow">I will buy shoulder pads for you.</font>

62
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,850
<font color="yellow">I will buy them in bulk for you.</font>

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,820
<font color="yellow">Now that you're back home, I feel very secure.</font>

64
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,480
<font color="yellow">Your dad is right.</font>

65
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,820
<font color="yellow">Just having my children around me makes me proud.</font>

66
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,820
<font color="yellow">I wish you were like this all the time.</font>

67
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,150
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow morning,</font>

68
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,820
<font color="yellow">you will go back saying, "I want to be proud of my children."</font>

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,380
<font color="yellow">You little scoundrel.</font>

70
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,050
<font color="yellow">Shall we race?</font>

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,420
<font color="yellow">Sure. You won't be able to keep up with me.</font>

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,520
<font color="yellow">We shall see about that.</font>

73
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,320
<font color="yellow">This is the starting line.</font>

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,620
<font color="yellow">Ready.</font>

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,920
<font color="yellow">- No cheating. - I won't.</font>

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,320
<font color="yellow">Ready.</font>

77
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,320
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

78
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,650
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

79
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,050
<font color="yellow">Mum, this is delicious.</font>

80
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,950
<font color="yellow">- Is it? - I remember the good old days.</font>

81
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,350
<font color="yellow">It's your favourite, biji jjigye. Enjoy.</font>

82
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,220
<font color="yellow">Now, the world will revolve around Se Gye.</font>

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,580
<font color="yellow">My Dal Pa is in the dog house.</font>

84
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,620
<font color="yellow">That doesn't even deserve a response.</font>

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,650
<font color="yellow">I should take away his food.</font>

86
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,850
<font color="yellow">I exercised in the morning, and I have a hearty appetite.</font>

87
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,780
<font color="yellow">- Would you like more rice? - Sure.</font>

88
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,080
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

89
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,220
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here so early?</font>

90
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,950
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to book a wedding hall at a hotel.</font>

91
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,920
<font color="yellow">Are you having a wedding at a hotel?</font>

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,150
<font color="yellow">Of course, he should. Did you eat breakfast?</font>

93
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,020
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't. Can I eat, too?</font>

94
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,380
<font color="yellow">- Bring Se Bang's rice, too! - Hey.</font>

95
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,750
<font color="yellow">- Where is Ddol Ee? - He's at kindergarten.</font>

96
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,850
<font color="yellow">Why would you have a wedding at a hotel?</font>

97
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,520
<font color="yellow">A wedding should be done at a nice place.</font>

98
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,650
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with having a wedding at a hotel with her son's father?</font>

99
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,180
<font color="yellow">How can she get married three times?</font>

100
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,520
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

101
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,950
<font color="yellow">No one's married three times in our family, right?</font>

102
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,620
<font color="yellow">Sure, someone may not have married three times,</font>

103
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,880
<font color="yellow">but I'm sure she's been with countless numbers of men.</font>

104
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,950
<font color="yellow">Don't say such things.</font>

105
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,680
<font color="yellow">She started it.</font>

106
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,150
<font color="yellow">I didn't start anything. I'm just stating the facts.</font>

107
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,780
<font color="yellow">I'm just stating the facts, too.</font>

108
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,120
<font color="yellow">Stop it, both of you.</font>

109
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,780
<font color="yellow">Why are you running into the kitchen while Se Gye is sitting still?</font>

110
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,280
<font color="yellow">- We're having a wedding? - Sure, why not?</font>

111
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,650
<font color="yellow">If you don't have a wedding, people might spread rumours.</font>

112
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,480
<font color="yellow">Let everyone know that you're marrying Ddol Ee's father.</font>

113
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,750
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, what are you doing at home at this hour?</font>

114
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,580
<font color="yellow">He spent the night here.</font>

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,950
<font color="yellow">- Se Gye got kicked... - Mal Nyeon.</font>

116
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,750
<font color="yellow">There's a good reason for it.</font>

117
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,620
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, let's get a drink together sometime soon.</font>

118
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,420
<font color="yellow">Perhaps later.</font>

119
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,650
<font color="yellow">(Director Yeo Si Nae)</font>

120
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,650
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,320
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you. What brings you here?</font>

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,280
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

123
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,320
<font color="yellow">Do you want something to drink?</font>

124
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,880
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

125
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,420
<font color="yellow">I ate and don't want anything to drink.</font>

126
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,050
<font color="yellow">Can you lend me some money with no questions asked?</font>

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,950
<font color="yellow">You need money? How much?</font>

128
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,550
<font color="yellow">I need a lot.</font>

129
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,080
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. How much do you need?</font>

130
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,480
<font color="yellow">- I need three big ones. - Three big ones?</font>

131
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,050
<font color="yellow">3,000 dollars.</font>

132
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,380
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

133
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,320
<font color="yellow">- What is this? - You said you needed 3,000 dollars.</font>

134
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,650
<font color="yellow">No way. Where did you get this money?</font>

135
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,920
<font color="yellow">Just look inside.</font>

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,550
<font color="yellow">Is it really okay to take this money?</font>

137
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,480
<font color="yellow">(1,000 dollars)</font>

138
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,780
<font color="yellow">You don't have to pay back quickly.</font>

139
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,180
<font color="yellow">Just pay me when you have...</font>

140
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,020
<font color="yellow">- Why? - It's too much.</font>

141
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,580
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful.</font>

142
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,850
<font color="yellow">However, I would have taken care of it if the amount was this much.</font>

143
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,320
<font color="yellow">There's another zero to this figure.</font>

144
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,150
<font color="yellow">I guess you never handled more than 1,000 dollars.</font>

145
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

146
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,780
<font color="yellow">- What's the largest amount? - 100,000 dollars.</font>

147
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,150
<font color="yellow">You handled 100,000 dollars before?</font>

148
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,950
<font color="yellow">I've never even seen such a large sum.</font>

149
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,120
<font color="yellow">Thank you for caring.</font>

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,080
<font color="yellow">I regretted after I told you.</font>

151
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,380
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have said anything to someone so poor.</font>

152
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,620
<font color="yellow">This is very popular.</font>

153
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,580
<font color="yellow">I think you will look great in this.</font>

154
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,880
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Do you like this?</font>

155
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,450
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.</font>

156
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,380
<font color="yellow">I think you are deeply in love with the bride.</font>

157
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,220
<font color="yellow">I will bring the paper works.</font>

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,320
<font color="yellow">She says that I'm the only one in love.</font>

159
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,920
<font color="yellow">Are you glad to hear that?</font>

160
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,380
<font color="yellow">Look happy. People might think I'm forcing you to marry me.</font>

161
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,520
<font color="yellow">- Did you make the reservation? - Yes.</font>

162
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,720
<font color="yellow">It's not like she's getting married for the first time.</font>

163
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,450
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure you're thrilled. - Why, you...</font>

164
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,050
<font color="yellow">Is the hotel nice?</font>

165
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,220
<font color="yellow">It's a hotel.</font>

166
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,520
<font color="yellow">You got married at a hotel when you married Geum Sik.</font>

167
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,690
<font color="yellow">They only had a reception there.</font>

168
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,780
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring him up?</font>

169
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,420
<font color="yellow">You're so tactless.</font>

170
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,050
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

171
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,720
<font color="yellow">- To where? - I've been transferred to the US.</font>

172
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,480
<font color="yellow">Why so suddenly?</font>

173
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,190
<font color="yellow">I asked to go.</font>

174
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,690
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Jae Soon?</font>

175
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,050
<font color="yellow">- You're still here? - Yes.</font>

176
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,550
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, do you have time this evening?</font>

177
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,320
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I'm asking you on a date.</font>

178
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,250
<font color="yellow">I'll do as you say.</font>

179
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,920
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong. Thank you.</font>

180
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,250
<font color="yellow">I made her change her mind.</font>

181
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,180
<font color="yellow">It's not because of you.</font>

182
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,950
<font color="yellow">Thanks anyways.</font>

183
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,420
<font color="yellow">I told her that she won't need to study hard like she does here...</font>

184
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,350
<font color="yellow">or even go to private institutions.</font>

185
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,780
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik, we have everything planned.</font>

186
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,120
<font color="yellow">When we go to the US we're going to travel around.</font>

187
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,620
<font color="yellow">I'm going to rent a car and go on a road trip.</font>

188
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,080
<font color="yellow">Disneyland, Las Vegas and New York.</font>

189
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,850
<font color="yellow">There are so many places to go.</font>

190
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,850
<font color="yellow">I want to go quickly.</font>

191
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,550
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, what did I tell you to do first?</font>

192
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,350
<font color="yellow">To grow my front teeth.</font>

193
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,480
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee's teeth must have fallen out like Da Rong's.</font>

194
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,880
<font color="yellow">Why are you mentioning that? You have no sense.</font>

195
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,680
<font color="yellow">(Saesak Kindergarten)</font>

196
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,750
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

197
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,420
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

198
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,380
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, it's been a while. You haven't forgotten me, have you?</font>

199
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,820
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

200
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,020
<font color="yellow">You've grown bigger.</font>

201
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,950
<font color="yellow">Are you better now?</font>

202
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,780
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

203
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,950
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, your teeth fell out as well.</font>

204
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,580
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

205
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,280
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

206
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,520
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

207
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,780
<font color="yellow">Don't be ill and stay healthy.</font>

208
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,220
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for everything.</font>

209
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,450
<font color="yellow">Listen to your mother and take care of yourself.</font>

210
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,420
<font color="yellow">Become a great man.</font>

211
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,480
<font color="yellow">Let's meet again when you grown up.</font>

212
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,580
<font color="yellow">This is too much.</font>

213
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,250
<font color="yellow">Let's go to a cart bar.</font>

214
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,650
<font color="yellow">I need to spend this much if I'm going on a date with an older woman.</font>

215
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,680
<font color="yellow">You're going to become another man's woman soon.</font>

216
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,750
<font color="yellow">You make strange jokes.</font>

217
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,080
<font color="yellow">That's what Man Joo told me.</font>

218
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,250
<font color="yellow">Do I make bad jokes?</font>

219
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,180
<font color="yellow">You make jokes out of hurtful things.</font>

220
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,550
<font color="yellow">This must be an expensive place.</font>

221
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,280
<font color="yellow">I can pay for this. I kept a bottle as well.</font>

222
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,150
<font color="yellow">- There's some leftover, right? - You drank it all.</font>

223
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,620
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

224
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,420
<font color="yellow">Who do you think I am?</font>

225
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,050
<font color="yellow">- I'll have the same drink. - Okay.</font>

226
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,850
<font color="yellow">Stay here. I need to wash my hands.</font>

227
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,250
<font color="yellow">I just arrived.</font>

228
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,680
<font color="yellow">I used to come here often. It's a nice place.</font>

229
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,080
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's the right place for today.</font>

230
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,620
<font color="yellow">I'll find another place.</font>

231
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,650
<font color="yellow">I'll call you soon.</font>

232
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,650
<font color="yellow">How are things with Man Joo?</font>

233
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,950
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

234
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,550
<font color="yellow">When you got married,</font>

235
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,950
<font color="yellow">I had my own troubles. I couldn't be more considerate.</font>

236
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,120
<font color="yellow">I knew you were having a hard time but I ignored it.</font>

237
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,580
<font color="yellow">I was always worried about that.</font>

238
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,380
<font color="yellow">People...</font>

239
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,580
<font color="yellow">need to live with those whom they love.</font>

240
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,420
<font color="yellow">I hope you choose as you wish.</font>

241
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,520
<font color="yellow">Of course Mum and Dad will think differently.</font>

242
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,480
<font color="yellow">You have something to say, right?</font>

243
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,320
<font color="yellow">Don't walk on eggshells. Spill it. I'll help if it's not about money.</font>

244
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,250
<font color="yellow">Actually, I wasn't sure.</font>

245
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,550
<font color="yellow">If I should tell your or not.</font>

246
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,250
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

247
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,880
<font color="yellow">I think I need to tell you.</font>

248
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,680
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik is leaving.</font>

249
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,920
<font color="yellow">Leaving?</font>

250
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,580
<font color="yellow">He applied for a branch in the US...</font>

251
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,850
<font color="yellow">because of you.</font>

252
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,420
<font color="yellow">To forget you.</font>

253
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,850
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee fell asleep.</font>

254
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,050
<font color="yellow">I'll take him in.</font>

255
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,750
<font color="yellow">I thought you went out with Se Gye.</font>

256
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,380
<font color="yellow">He went to see someone.</font>

257
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,250
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Go sleep in your room.</font>

258
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,450
<font color="yellow">What's this? It looks new.</font>

259
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,250
<font color="yellow">- He gave it to me. - Who?</font>

260
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,280
<font color="yellow">He came to my school and gave it to me.</font>

261
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
<font color="yellow">He told me to become a great man.</font>

262
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,780
<font color="yellow">He's leaving to forget you.</font>

263
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,950
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

264
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,420
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

265
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,120
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

266
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,820
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you picking up?</font>

267
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,420
<font color="yellow">- Did you call? - Are you out of your mind?</font>

268
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,320
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

269
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,350
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

270
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about before.</font>

271
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,820
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean that you spoiled the mood.</font>

272
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,890
<font color="yellow">Is that why you were offended?</font>

273
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,750
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm saying.</font>

274
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,550
<font color="yellow">Are you still drunk or sleepy?</font>

275
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,850
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

276
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,950
<font color="yellow">What about the kids?</font>

277
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,180
<font color="yellow">What am I?</font>

278
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,680
<font color="yellow">Because of a worthless person like me,</font>

279
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,180
<font color="yellow">does it make sense to take your kids to the US?</font>

280
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,350
<font color="yellow">What am I that you can't forget about me?</font>

281
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,550
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel sorry for your kids who don't have a mum?</font>

282
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,820
<font color="yellow">How will they cope in a foreign place?</font>

283
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,920
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to take care of them because of your work.</font>

284
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,150
<font color="yellow">They are already shy and have been bullied.</font>

285
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,520
<font color="yellow">Why did you make that choice?</font>

286
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,480
<font color="yellow">You're a terrible dad.</font>

287
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,320
<font color="yellow">Is that why you came to see Ddol Ee?</font>

288
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,320
<font color="yellow">To say goodbye?</font>

289
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,550
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

290
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,680
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

291
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,720
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do.</font>

292
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,250
<font color="yellow">To make up for what I did to my kid,</font>

293
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,420
<font color="yellow">I was going to give up my life as a woman.</font>

294
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,550
<font color="yellow">I was going to live my life as a mum but...</font>

295
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,550
<font color="yellow">My feelings for you...</font>

296
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,950
<font color="yellow">are still here.</font>

297
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,120
<font color="yellow">When I wake up in the morning,</font>

298
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,580
<font color="yellow">you're the first thing that comes to my mind.</font>

299
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,480
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought.</font>

300
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,320
<font color="yellow">I was going to date you until our kids grow up.</font>

301
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,020
<font color="yellow">When we become 50 or 60 years old...</font>

302
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,620
<font color="yellow">When our kids can be left out of it...</font>

303
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,780
<font color="yellow">If you stayed next to me until then,</font>

304
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,180
<font color="yellow">I thought of living with you.</font>

305
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,420
<font color="yellow">I know I'm being selfish.</font>

306
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,150
<font color="yellow">You need to remarry and settle down.</font>

307
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
<font color="yellow">I can't hold onto you out of greed.</font>

308
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,920
<font color="yellow">I can't do this or that.</font>

309
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,390
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

310
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,450
<font color="yellow">give me some time.</font>

311
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,350
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

312
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,280
<font color="yellow">Don't you understand?</font>

313
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,280
<font color="yellow">Give me some time.</font>

314
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,680
<font color="yellow">To figure out what to do with you.</font>

315
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,220
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

316
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,550
<font color="yellow">I don't need this.</font>

317
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,950
<font color="yellow">(It's a large amount of money.)</font>

318
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,890
<font color="yellow">It's a huge amount of money.</font>

319
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,620
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

320
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,320
<font color="yellow">She wants to have some time.</font>

321
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,650
<font color="yellow">Time to do what?</font>

322
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,020
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you? You already set the date.</font>

323
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,280
<font color="yellow">You even reserved your wedding hall.</font>

324
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,150
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

325
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,750
<font color="yellow">You went out for drinks last night.</font>

326
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,220
<font color="yellow">Hey. Did anything happen?</font>

327
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,680
<font color="yellow">What happened last night?</font>

328
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,050
<font color="yellow">I told Jae Soon to think about it once again.</font>

329
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,850
<font color="yellow">- What? - Just mind your own business.</font>

330
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,050
<font color="yellow">Since it's her life, she has to be the one who decides.</font>

331
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,580
<font color="yellow">Considering her personality,</font>

332
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,650
<font color="yellow">if everyone forces her, she just follows.</font>

333
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,650
<font color="yellow">So I wanted her to consider it again.</font>

334
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,890
<font color="yellow">It's not all because of what Se Gye said.</font>

335
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,450
<font color="yellow">Please give me some time to think it over.</font>

336
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,420
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, I think we should have a drink soon.</font>

337
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,050
<font color="yellow">Come out for a bit.</font>

338
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,020
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

339
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,580
<font color="yellow">You weren't happy either when reserving the wedding hall. Why not?</font>

340
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,120
<font color="yellow">I said I need to think it over.</font>

341
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,020
<font color="yellow">Be honest. This is because you haven't forgotten him yet, right?</font>

342
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,720
<font color="yellow">- What? - He told me...</font>

343
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,780
<font color="yellow">that you married him because you liked him.</font>

344
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,180
<font color="yellow">Your parents said you were almost forced to get married to him...</font>

345
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,820
<font color="yellow">but he said you married him because you fell for him.</font>

346
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,420
<font color="yellow">Because he is tall, handsome...</font>

347
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,620
<font color="yellow">and rich. He even has charming buttocks, right?</font>

348
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,080
<font color="yellow">You didn't fall asleep without his arm under your head, did you?</font>

349
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,250
<font color="yellow">And you never looked messy in front of him?</font>

350
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,950
<font color="yellow">Did you like the guy that much?</font>

351
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,650
<font color="yellow">Jo Geum Sik or whatever said this, too.</font>

352
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,920
<font color="yellow">You are usually led by people...</font>

353
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
<font color="yellow">but you start to lead them when you really like them.</font>

354
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,020
<font color="yellow">How far did you go leading him?</font>

355
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,220
<font color="yellow">I can't talk to a jerk like you any more.</font>

356
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,150
<font color="yellow">What a lowlife you are.</font>

357
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,550
<font color="yellow">I'm hesitating because you're like this.</font>

358
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,150
<font color="yellow">I can't trust you.</font>

359
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,520
<font color="yellow">Your only merit is that you are Ddol Ee's dad.</font>

360
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,750
<font color="yellow">I want to end with you right away...</font>

361
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,350
<font color="yellow">but I said I wanted to consider it again because we have Ddol Ee.</font>

362
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,550
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

363
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,850
<font color="yellow">Hey. Shin Jae Soon!</font>

364
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,950
<font color="yellow">Why did you say so to your sister?</font>

365
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,320
<font color="yellow">You know very well about her.</font>

366
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,350
<font color="yellow">I told her because I know her very well.</font>

367
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,680
<font color="yellow">Please leave her alone now.</font>

368
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,220
<font color="yellow">She's been dragged by you all along regarding her marriage and divorce.</font>

369
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,350
<font color="yellow">"Think of your situation."</font>

370
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,650
<font color="yellow">"You don't have money or skills."</font>

371
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,220
<font color="yellow">Even I can remember your lines.</font>

372
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,480
<font color="yellow">This is between you and me, but it is true about her.</font>

373
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,750
<font color="yellow">Who do you think will pay attention to her if she gets older?</font>

374
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,520
<font color="yellow">And we are not rich and neither are you now.</font>

375
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,050
<font color="yellow">Never mind this.</font>

376
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,150
<font color="yellow">I knew you would change your attitude overnight.</font>

377
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,550
<font color="yellow">Mum, please let Jae Soon take care of her own problems.</font>

378
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,180
<font color="yellow">She is 40 years old already.</font>

379
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,280
<font color="yellow">You don't have to listen to Se Gye. Men don't know anything.</font>

380
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,920
<font color="yellow">I'm not a smart person.</font>

381
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,820
<font color="yellow">I have to consider something many times more than others.</font>

382
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,380
<font color="yellow">I have been thoughtless so far.</font>

383
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,920
<font color="yellow">In order to live off of a rich guy,</font>

384
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,720
<font color="yellow">I made easy choices.</font>

385
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,250
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be like that any more.</font>

386
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,480
<font color="yellow">Since I have a head, I want to use it to think.</font>

387
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,920
<font color="yellow">Did you realise you have a head now?</font>

388
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,650
<font color="yellow">I just saw it in the mirror.</font>

389
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,850
<font color="yellow">Don't look in the mirror then.</font>

390
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,850
<font color="yellow">Congratulations. Here is your family relation certificate.</font>

391
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,520
<font color="yellow">We finally became a married couple.</font>

392
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,080
<font color="yellow">We already were.</font>

393
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,050
<font color="yellow">I mean legally.</font>

394
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,750
<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

395
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,880
<font color="yellow">Now, I'm definitely a married woman.</font>

396
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,250
<font color="yellow">You don't like it? If so, I'll go cancel this.</font>

397
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,780
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

398
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,480
<font color="yellow">- Don't. - Okay. I'll put it in here.</font>

399
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,920
<font color="yellow">Are you shooting a movie or what?</font>

400
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,550
<font color="yellow">You were not holding hands these days.</font>

401
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,050
<font color="yellow">We registered our marriage today.</font>

402
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,950
<font color="yellow">Make sure to treat me as an adult.</font>

403
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,220
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

404
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,950
<font color="yellow">Just wait. It won't take long for me, either.</font>

405
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,620
<font color="yellow">You don't have a girlfriend yet.</font>

406
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,320
<font color="yellow">You may be surprised soon.</font>

407
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,920
<font color="yellow">I have to go deliver the food.</font>

408
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,480
<font color="yellow">Does Dal Tong have a girlfriend now?</font>

409
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,250
<font color="yellow">You know what he is like.</font>

410
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,780
<font color="yellow">He thinks they like him when they order delivery.</font>

411
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,180
<font color="yellow">Is he still like that?</font>

412
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,020
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to deliver food again?</font>

413
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,380
<font color="yellow">Did you come out all the way here to wait for me?</font>

414
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,350
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

415
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,350
<font color="yellow">They said they registered their marriage.</font>

416
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,020
<font color="yellow">I don't understand them.</font>

417
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,480
<font color="yellow">How could a couple date for as long as 10 years?</font>

418
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,450
<font color="yellow">Do you know what my creed is?</font>

419
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,350
<font color="yellow">"Before jjajangmyeon gets soggy and while jjamppong is still hot..."</font>

420
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,280
<font color="yellow">Write it down when I say such things.</font>

421
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,820
<font color="yellow">I got to go before this gets soggy.</font>

422
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,920
<font color="yellow">(Family relation certificate)</font>

423
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,120
<font color="yellow">You finally became a married couple formally.</font>

424
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,020
<font color="yellow">You really did. How do you feel?</font>

425
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,680
<font color="yellow">Maybe they want to run away.</font>

426
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,250
<font color="yellow">A little bit.</font>

427
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,920
<font color="yellow">Me, too. All my great times are gone.</font>

428
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,580
<font color="yellow">Although we went out for more than 10 years,</font>

429
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,050
<font color="yellow">I think marriage is completely different from dating.</font>

430
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,750
<font color="yellow">It is true. Men and women can't understand each other well.</font>

431
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,380
<font color="yellow">I don't know all about my husband yet.</font>

432
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,020
<font color="yellow">It won't be fun if you knew it all.</font>

433
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,320
<font color="yellow">If you expect a lot, you'll get disappointed easily.</font>

434
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,750
<font color="yellow">So don't expect the other to do the same for you...</font>

435
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,380
<font color="yellow">when you do something for them.</font>

436
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,450
<font color="yellow">They said instead of taking advantage of the other,</font>

437
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,080
<font color="yellow">you should think of what you can do for your partner.</font>

438
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,020
<font color="yellow">That's what a couple is for.</font>

439
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,750
<font color="yellow">Easier said than done because we are not saints.</font>

440
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,380
<font color="yellow">It's strange that we fight more after we got married.</font>

441
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
<font color="yellow">It's because you don't want to lose what you have.</font>

442
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,620
<font color="yellow">You think you'll lose all your life if you lose at first.</font>

443
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,850
<font color="yellow">So you try your best not to lose.</font>

444
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,880
<font color="yellow">You can be generous to others...</font>

445
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,550
<font color="yellow">but you don't want to lose to your spouse.</font>

446
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,420
<font color="yellow">"I'll keep my own stance from the start."</font>

447
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,020
<font color="yellow">"If I yield now, I might suffer the loss forever."</font>

448
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,950
<font color="yellow">This is all because of selfishness.</font>

449
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,850
<font color="yellow">We'll try not to be like that.</font>

450
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,220
<font color="yellow">We're okay with other problems, but we always fight regarding his mum.</font>

451
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,880
<font color="yellow">You should try to understand her as much as possible. She is lonely.</font>

452
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,050
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

453
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,720
<font color="yellow">It is delicious.</font>

454
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,950
<font color="yellow">This is my mum's favourite.</font>

455
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,620
<font color="yellow">My mum went through a lot all her life.</font>

456
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,880
<font color="yellow">Now I understand why Gab Soon gets upset.</font>

457
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,180
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

458
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,850
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. I sure am.</font>

459
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,580
<font color="yellow">(Family Relation Certificate)</font>

460
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,950
<font color="yellow">Take care of each other dearly from now on.</font>

461
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,320
<font color="yellow">You are definitely a married couple now.</font>

462
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,050
<font color="yellow">You're saying the exact words that Gab Soon said.</font>

463
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,780
<font color="yellow">You sound like Gab Soon.</font>

464
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,080
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard it is to live a life without a husband?</font>

465
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,380
<font color="yellow">I won't die young. How can I die when Gab Soon is here?</font>

466
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,420
<font color="yellow">Do not interfere when I'm talking to her.</font>

467
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,120
<font color="yellow">Without a husband,</font>

468
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,450
<font color="yellow">a woman has to suffer a lot. So be nice to him while he is around.</font>

469
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,750
<font color="yellow">I'll also have to suffer if Gab Soon is not around.</font>

470
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,680
<font color="yellow">I said not to interfere.</font>

471
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
<font color="yellow">You babble a lot.</font>

472
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,050
<font color="yellow">You got talkative after you got married.</font>

473
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,720
<font color="yellow">You're right. He got unattractive after we got married.</font>

474
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,080
<font color="yellow">Go to your room now.</font>

475
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,420
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - What?</font>

476
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,580
<font color="yellow">Do you watch these kinds of clips, too?</font>

477
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,250
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

478
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,650
<font color="yellow">Yes. Dal Pa taught me how to watch them.</font>

479
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,650
<font color="yellow">There are many interesting clips here.</font>

480
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,750
<font color="yellow">- Shall I try to upload one? - Your face will be exposed.</font>

481
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,580
<font color="yellow">What's the big deal? I don't mind it.</font>

482
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,550
<font color="yellow">Exposing my face is not a problem.</font>

483
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,450
<font color="yellow">When I was young, I wanted to become an actor.</font>

484
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,750
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to become a doctor.</font>

485
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,750
<font color="yellow">You can have many dreams.</font>

486
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,950
<font color="yellow">I had a lot of dreams.</font>

487
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,480
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa.</font>

488
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,920
<font color="yellow">I want to upload a video clip. What would you recommend?</font>

489
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,780
<font color="yellow">Nowadays, eating shows and cooking shows are popular.</font>

490
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,620
<font color="yellow">Eating and cooking.</font>

491
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

492
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,880
<font color="yellow">You can upload anything.</font>

493
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,120
<font color="yellow">Someone uploaded a clip of doing meditation while sitting still.</font>

494
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,420
<font color="yellow">And some people uploaded footage of their studying all day long.</font>

495
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,480
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

496
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,950
<font color="yellow">Once you are known to the public, you can't go around outside...</font>

497
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,420
<font color="yellow">and you can't erase them.</font>

498
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,080
<font color="yellow">It's okay if you don't do anything wrong.</font>

499
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,750
<font color="yellow">Uncle, do it since you have a lot of time.</font>

500
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,780
<font color="yellow">It's great to kill time.</font>

501
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,280
<font color="yellow">Don't ever bring such things.</font>

502
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,820
<font color="yellow">Am I a puppy or what?</font>

503
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,380
<font color="yellow">If you threw food and called me,</font>

504
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,920
<font color="yellow">did you think I would wag my tail and follow you?</font>

505
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,550
<font color="yellow">I didn't meant that.</font>

506
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,120
<font color="yellow">Let's not do something we'd feel embarrassed in front of the kids.</font>

507
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,680
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you need money.</font>

508
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,250
<font color="yellow">But you don't have money.</font>

509
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
<font color="yellow">There is some I saved without your mum's knowing.</font>

510
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,220
<font color="yellow">I have enough to give you pocket money.</font>

511
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,880
<font color="yellow">I'm still okay.</font>

512
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,320
<font color="yellow">I get money for my activities.</font>

513
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,920
<font color="yellow">I can't spend a fortune, but...</font>

514
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,720
<font color="yellow">I can make my living on my own.</font>

515
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,450
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

516
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,080
<font color="yellow">Did you wrap up with Gong Joo?</font>

517
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

518
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,450
<font color="yellow">I feel apologetic to her.</font>

519
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,680
<font color="yellow">She is still young...</font>

520
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,820
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that she had to go through such a hard time.</font>

521
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,680
<font color="yellow">I wasn't nice to her.</font>

522
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,550
<font color="yellow">Anyway, it's a shame.</font>

523
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,950
<font color="yellow">How is it going with Ms Jung?</font>

524
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,620
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest. She's more than just a friend, isn't she?</font>

525
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,980
<font color="yellow">Do you have any plans?</font>

526
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,420
<font color="yellow">He didn't answer?</font>

527
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,680
<font color="yellow">He just smiled.</font>

528
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,620
<font color="yellow">She's a nice girl, though.</font>

529
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,420
<font color="yellow">It's not going to be easy.</font>

530
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,980
<font color="yellow">I bet the whole family is going to take advantage of...</font>

531
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,650
<font color="yellow">the daughter of the doctor.</font>

532
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,580
<font color="yellow">I don't want to even hear it. That's not what family is like.</font>

533
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,320
<font color="yellow">They're not the only one.</font>

534
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,150
<font color="yellow">It seems like...</font>

535
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,750
<font color="yellow">every family has at least one person who sacrifices for the rest.</font>

536
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,550
<font color="yellow">What if he says he wants to marry Man Joo?</font>

537
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,820
<font color="yellow">Don't count your chickens before they hatch.</font>

538
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,050
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

539
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,920
<font color="yellow">If they get married, who do you think would be disadvantaged?</font>

540
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,580
<font color="yellow">Of course it'd be Se Gye. There's no doubt.</font>

541
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,950
<font color="yellow">Se Gye is like a used product. He already married once.</font>

542
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,220
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon.</font>

543
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,120
<font color="yellow">He was married only for a year.</font>

544
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,380
<font color="yellow">They didn't even register the marriage.</font>

545
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,550
<font color="yellow">The package was opened anyway.</font>

546
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,180
<font color="yellow">Once the package is opened, it's used.</font>

547
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,480
<font color="yellow">Man Joo isn't a rubbish bin. She won't accept anyone.</font>

548
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,920
<font color="yellow">Are you saying Se Gye is rubbish?</font>

549
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,150
<font color="yellow">Your mouth will bring you down someday.</font>

550
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,450
<font color="yellow">I'm already hopeless.</font>

551
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,480
<font color="yellow">This isn't why I've become living proof.</font>

552
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,750
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

553
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,180
<font color="yellow">What do you want to say?</font>

554
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,120
<font color="yellow">Study abroad.</font>

555
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,920
<font color="yellow">You're kicking me out as well?</font>

556
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,980
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

557
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,080
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

558
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,350
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

559
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,520
<font color="yellow">You can wash the dishes later.</font>

560
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,720
<font color="yellow">I need to do them now.</font>

561
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,850
<font color="yellow">I can never let the dishes lying in the sink.</font>

562
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,780
<font color="yellow">Then could you do it more gently?</font>

563
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,850
<font color="yellow">After studying abroad, get married to the guy I set you up with.</font>

564
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,720
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to do everything as you like?</font>

565
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,650
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to be your puppet.</font>

566
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,720
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

567
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,020
<font color="yellow">This guy doesn't want to get washed just like me.</font>

568
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,320
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to be your puppet any more.</font>

569
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,880
<font color="yellow">I'll get back together with Se Gye.</font>

570
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,650
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

571
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,550
<font color="yellow">Did you forget what his family has done to us?</font>

572
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,450
<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?</font>

573
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,780
<font color="yellow">We're done with his family.</font>

574
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,720
<font color="yellow">No, it's not. I'll do what I want.</font>

575
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,350
<font color="yellow">You live your life. I'll live my life.</font>

576
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,080
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo.</font>

577
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,180
<font color="yellow">I cooked some kimchi pancake.</font>

578
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,120
<font color="yellow">You must be stressed from many things.</font>

579
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,550
<font color="yellow">I'm ashamed that you saw it.</font>

580
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,080
<font color="yellow">I've seen much worse things in life. Don't worry.</font>

581
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
<font color="yellow">I've already seen enough of fights between...</font>

582
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,290
<font color="yellow">a mother and a daughter before I moved here.</font>

583
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,020
<font color="yellow">Try some.</font>

584
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,480
<font color="yellow">Kimchi pancake tastes good when it's still warm.</font>

585
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,650
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like it.</font>

586
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,950
<font color="yellow">You don't know how tasty it is.</font>

587
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,150
<font color="yellow">- Open your mouth. - I can eat myself.</font>

588
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,750
<font color="yellow">Pancake tastes best when your mum feeds you.</font>

589
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

590
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,180
<font color="yellow">It's tasty, isn't it? Doesn't it taste amazing?</font>

591
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,050
<font color="yellow">It is tasty. It's perfectly seasoned.</font>

592
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,790
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you crying because it tastes so good?</font>

593
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,820
<font color="yellow">It reminds me of my mum.</font>

594
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,950
<font color="yellow">My mum used to feed me pancakes like this.</font>

595
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,520
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a mum.</font>

596
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,320
<font color="yellow">Did you grow up without a mother?</font>

597
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,550
<font color="yellow">So you've never been fed pancakes by your mother.</font>

598
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,120
<font color="yellow">It tastes great.</font>

599
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,680
<font color="yellow">It tastes 100 times better than eating it myself.</font>

600
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,080
<font color="yellow">Si Nae, how about you just wait and see how Gong Joo deals with it,</font>

601
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,790
<font color="yellow">instead of scolding her?</font>

602
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,480
<font color="yellow">I also just set Soo Jo free whenever he was being stubborn.</font>

603
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,150
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo was also often troublesome, wasn't he?</font>

604
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,050
<font color="yellow">He's even a boy.</font>

605
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,790

612
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,950
<font color="yellow">on such a cold day when there was a snowstorm,</font>

613
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,580
<font color="yellow">why did you go to the river?</font>

614
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,520
<font color="yellow">Was it because...</font>

615
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,550
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,790

<font color="yellow">Were you the same?</font>

618
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,350
<font color="yellow">I had a baby when I was only 18 years old.</font>

619
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,150
<font color="yellow">There was nothing I could do.</font>

620
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,480
<font color="yellow">I was going to kill myself and the baby,</font>

621
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,820
<font color="yellow">but it crossed my mind that I had to at least let the baby live.</font>

622
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,180
<font color="yellow">I left the baby and was walking into the river.</font>

623
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
<font color="yellow">But then I heard the baby crying.</font>

624
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,350
<font color="yellow">If you didn't take him then,</font>

625

627
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,450
<font color="yellow">Now that I think of it,</font>

628
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,180
<font color="yellow">I almost let the baby freeze to death.</font>

629
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,520
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I left the baby there in the middle of the night.</font>

630
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,790
<font color="yellow">This is probably how it's meant to be.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm getting old without children of my own.</font>

759
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,280
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so startled?</font>

760
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,580
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

761
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,120
<font color="yellow">The manager's asking for us.</font>

762
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

763
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,250
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

764
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,720
<font color="yellow">It looks nice.</font>

765
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,020
<font color="yellow">I look good in anything.</font>

766
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,520
<font color="yellow">How's the jacket?</font>

767
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,750
<font color="yellow">Look. I designed it.</font>

768
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,320
<font color="yellow">- Are you serious? - Yes.</font>

769
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,820
<font color="yellow">A designer edited it but it was my idea.</font>

770
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,950
<font color="yellow">I got some prize money from the employee contest.</font>

771
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,120
<font color="yellow">I used it to pay for my twin's formula.</font>

772
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,380
<font color="yellow">Formula?</font>

773
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,250
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

774
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
<font color="yellow">I have a twin sister.</font>

775
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,520
<font color="yellow">If I studied, I would have become a great designer.</font>

776
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,250
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

777
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,350
<font color="yellow">It was my childhood dream to become a designer.</font>

778
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,920
<font color="yellow">What is your dream?</font>

779
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,150
<font color="yellow">To get married into a wealthy family.</font>

780
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,080
<font color="yellow">Marrying into a wealthy family?</font>

781
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,050
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

782
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,320
<font color="yellow">I guess that was my dream as well.</font>

783
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,680
<font color="yellow">Having a wealthy husband?</font>

784
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,380
<font color="yellow">Marrying into a wealthy family.</font>

785
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,980
<font color="yellow">When I was little, I imagined myself being taken by a wealthy man.</font>

786
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,450
<font color="yellow">But what kind of a man would take me?</font>

787
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,280
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, we had the same dream. Right?</font>

788
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,250
<font color="yellow">The manager will be here in any minute. Hurry.</font>

789
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,150
<font color="yellow">I was the head of my household.</font>

790
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,150
<font color="yellow">If I studied, I would have become a great designer.</font>

791
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,380
<font color="yellow">(It's a large amount of money.)</font>

792
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,980
<font color="yellow">Is there anything bothering you?</font>

793
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,620
<font color="yellow">You can tell me.</font>

794
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,850
<font color="yellow">What it is? Is it money?</font>

795
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,980
<font color="yellow">Sir, do you have debt?</font>

796
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,320
<font color="yellow">We lived on noodles but we don't have any debt.</font>

797
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,550
<font color="yellow">- Why? - It's nothing.</font>

798
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,550
<font color="yellow">It's 30,000 dollars.</font>

799
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,480
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to pay you back.</font>

800
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,280
<font color="yellow">You don't have to. I won't ask.</font>

801
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,520
<font color="yellow">If you need money, ask me any time.</font>

802
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,020
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Please don't tell my dad.</font>

803
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,280
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

804
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,720
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Why are you here?</font>

805
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,880
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going, Director. - Okay.</font>

806
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,750
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey!</font>

807
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,780
<font color="yellow">How impolite. He was supposed to bow.</font>

808
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,220
<font color="yellow">I need to train him.</font>

809
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,580
<font color="yellow">Why was he here? Did he ask you not to fire him?</font>

810
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,720
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

811
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,080
<font color="yellow">He said he has a big family so he wants to keep working.</font>

812
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,150
<font color="yellow">And Ms Ban.</font>

813
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling him like you're calling a country boy?</font>

814
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,680
<font color="yellow">Don't say that any more.</font>

815
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,980
<font color="yellow">It's fun.</font>

816
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,580
<font color="yellow">It's only fun for you.</font>

817
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,350
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo didn't say anything either.</font>

818
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,650
<font color="yellow">Just don't do it.</font>

819
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,550
<font color="yellow">Also, don't do any more training either.</font>

820
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,350
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Ma'am. - He's an adult, too.</font>

821
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,920
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to him as if he's a child.</font>

822
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

823
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:24,650
<font color="yellow">You won't be fired. I talked to the director.</font>

824
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,550
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

825
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,550
<font color="yellow">My bus is here. Bye. See you next week.</font>

826
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,120
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

827
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,580
<font color="yellow">(10,000 dollars)</font>

828
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,650
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo. Soo Jo!</font>

829
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,550
<font color="yellow">What? Is something wrong?</font>

830
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,780
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this money?</font>

831
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,880
<font color="yellow">Don't ask.</font>

832
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,920
<font color="yellow">I know you. This can't be yours.</font>

833
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,350
<font color="yellow">I didn't steal it. Just use it.</font>

834
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:40,880
<font color="yellow">How can I trust you?</font>

835
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,280
<font color="yellow">Tell me everything. Otherwise, I can't take this money.</font>

836
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,250
<font color="yellow">Did you ask for an advance from the director?</font>

837
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,680
<font color="yellow">There's no way she would give you this much money.</font>

838
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,580
<font color="yellow">Did you get a personal loan?</font>

839
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,680
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

840
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,150
<font color="yellow">You said that loan sharks are after you.</font>

841
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,180
<font color="yellow">Just pay them back for now.</font>

842
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,650
<font color="yellow">Pay me back when you have the money.</font>

843
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,180
<font color="yellow">This is the first time someone has lent me money...</font>

844
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,050
<font color="yellow">without a promissory note.</font>

845
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,550
<font color="yellow">What if I run away without paying back?</font>

846
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,680
<font color="yellow">I know you won't do that.</font>

847
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,380
<font color="yellow">How can you trust me?</font>

848
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,420
<font color="yellow">You don't even know me well.</font>

849
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,920
<font color="yellow">I know you well enough. I don't need to know more.</font>

850
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,380
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

851
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,720
<font color="yellow">I will take this money for now.</font>

852
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,380
<font color="yellow">I will pay you back for sure.</font>

853
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,380
<font color="yellow">Your bus is here. Get on.</font>

854
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,720
<font color="yellow">Let's meet tomorrow.</font>

855
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,850
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

856
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,720
<font color="yellow">I will treat you.</font>

857
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,980
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

858
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,150
<font color="yellow">Meet me at Pyung Tae Park at noon!</font>

859
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,950
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

860
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,680
<font color="yellow">I'm writing an expense report. Mr Yeo wants to see it.</font>

861
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,450
<font color="yellow">It's your spending money.</font>

862
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,080
<font color="yellow">I don't need any money.</font>

863
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,980
<font color="yellow">My goal was to find a place where I can eat and live.</font>

864
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,950
<font color="yellow">Now that I've reached my goal, I don't want anything more.</font>

865
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,950
<font color="yellow">I know. However, a man needs money in his wallet...</font>

866
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,980
<font color="yellow">to feel confident.</font>

867
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,480
<font color="yellow">That's right. I need to buy some underwear.</font>

868
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,420
<font color="yellow">Many of my underwear have holes.</font>

869
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,650
<font color="yellow">I saw them in your room.</font>

870
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,080
<font color="yellow">Don't wear the ones with holes.</font>

871
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,050
<font color="yellow">Don't dry them in your room.</font>

872
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,580
<font color="yellow">Dry them confidently in the front yard.</font>

873
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,920
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed.</font>

874
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,050
<font color="yellow">Did you look for Soo Jo's potential wife?</font>

875
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,180
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

876
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,820
<font color="yellow">I hope she's pretty and kind.</font>

877
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,220
<font color="yellow">I hope she at least graduated high school.</font>

878
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,520
<font color="yellow">I hope her family isn't too poor.</font>

879
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,020
<font color="yellow">I want her family to have their own house.</font>

880
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,780
<font color="yellow">That's not enough.</font>

881
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,550
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo is a very precious son.</font>

882
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,750
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo is no longer Soo Jo of the past.</font>

883
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,320
<font color="yellow">He's not poor any more. He's genuinely wealthy now.</font>

884
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,820
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

885
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,820
<font color="yellow">I'm still the poor Geum Do Geum.</font>

886
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,680
<font color="yellow">Who cares where I work? It doesn't concern you.</font>

887
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,050
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me what to do.</font>

888
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,920
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm still your wife?</font>

889
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,220
<font color="yellow">Do not try to control me. Be quiet.</font>

890
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,720
<font color="yellow">Why do you talk to him that way?</font>

891
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,180
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything. He's the one picking a fight with me.</font>

892
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,920
<font color="yellow">You changed a lot. You used to be so polite.</font>

893
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,750
<font color="yellow">As I'm getting older, I'm becoming more blunt.</font>

894
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,320
<font color="yellow">I'm becoming like you.</font>

895
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,150
<font color="yellow">Now you're blaming me for that, too?</font>

896
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,550
<font color="yellow">Since when can you afford not to work?</font>

897
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,680
<font color="yellow">If he says don't work, don't work.</font>

898
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:14,020
<font color="yellow">Why do you insist on working there?</font>

899
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,380
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest.</font>

900
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,920
<font color="yellow">What man will treat you like that?</font>

901
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,080
<font color="yellow">A man who takes care of you is the best kind.</font>

902
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,420
<font color="yellow">You sure know how to make yourself miserable.</font>

903
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,980
<font color="yellow">You need to do the right thing.</font>

904
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,120
<font color="yellow">What does our family have to brag about?</font>

905
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,320
<font color="yellow">Let me be proud thanks to Jeon Se Bang.</font>

906
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,050
<font color="yellow">Stop being so obsessed about bragging.</font>

907
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,920
<font color="yellow">Didn't Se Gye say enough about that?</font>

908
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,680
<font color="yellow">You never say anything nice to me.</font>

909
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,350
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin. It's Dad's birthday today.</font>
