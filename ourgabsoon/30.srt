<font color="yellow">(Episode 30)</font>

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,910
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,540
<font color="yellow">What good will you get out of this?</font>

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,710
<font color="yellow">Don't ever come here again. You've seen how I live now.</font>

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,580
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I want to hold onto you.</font>

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,040
<font color="yellow">I desperately want to.</font>

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,440
<font color="yellow">I need you more than anything in the world right now.</font>

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,640
<font color="yellow">You're the only one I can trust the kids with.</font>

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,540
<font color="yellow">But if I do hold onto you now,</font>

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color="yellow">it'll only prove how unworthy I am.</font>

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your affections on me.</font>

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,510
<font color="yellow">Don't look back.</font>

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,510
<font color="yellow">Let's file the papers within this week.</font>

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,510
<font color="yellow">I'll see you in court.</font>

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,240
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This is so dirty.</font>

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,950
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - It's my turn to clean.</font>

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,640
<font color="yellow">I dropped Ddol Ee off at his art class.</font>

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,080
<font color="yellow">Where have you been? Did you get off work late today?</font>

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,640
<font color="yellow">It's obvious. She probably went to see Geum Sik.</font>

21
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,240
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik?</font>

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,310
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Will you keep up with that?</font>

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Let me ask you one thing.</font>

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,740
<font color="yellow">Now that you've decided to get a divorce, are your feelings growing?</font>

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,540
<font color="yellow">You're usually hungry when there's nothing much to eat.</font>

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,340
<font color="yellow">And your lover can't be more charming when he leaves you.</font>

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,880
<font color="yellow">It's nothing like that.</font>

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,580
<font color="yellow">We're going to court this week.</font>

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,810
<font color="yellow">- Does he want that? - Yes.</font>

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,980
<font color="yellow">- He should. - It's true.</font>

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,780
<font color="yellow">You need to file the papers to end the relationship.</font>

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,140
<font color="yellow">You've always been too soft.</font>

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,380
<font color="yellow">I guess you feel sorry for the kids. But why should you?</font>

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,880
<font color="yellow">Do they not have a father, a mother or a grandmother?</font>

35
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,810
<font color="yellow">He can send them to their grandmother's if he needs to.</font>

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,940
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever contact them again. All right?</font>

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,850
<font color="yellow">Do you understand or not?</font>

38
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,910
<font color="yellow">Why won't she respond?</font>

39
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,910
<font color="yellow">Since there's no reason to.</font>

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,080
<font color="yellow">- What? - Nothing.</font>

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,040
<font color="yellow">Don't mind her. Mind your own business.</font>

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,540
<font color="yellow">She must be frustrated.</font>

43
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,980
<font color="yellow">She can't do this nor that.</font>

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,380
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,010
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,580
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

47
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,980
<font color="yellow">- Really? - I saw it with my own two eyes.</font>

48
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,940
<font color="yellow">Maybe you're mistaken. Why would he?</font>

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,210
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,410
<font color="yellow">They looked very close. They looked like lovers.</font>

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,910
<font color="yellow">Like lovers?</font>

52
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,240
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,710
<font color="yellow">Do you want some help with that?</font>

54
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,310
<font color="yellow">No thanks. You'll push me again when someone sees us.</font>

55
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,080
<font color="yellow">I won't do that.</font>

56
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,280
<font color="yellow">If we kick them out and live together, I'll cook for you.</font>

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,440
<font color="yellow">- Don't do that. - Come on.</font>

58
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,880
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me. - Ms Nam.</font>

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,140
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

60
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,910
<font color="yellow">Why did that fall?</font>

61
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,340
<font color="yellow">It does that sometimes.</font>

62
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,940
<font color="yellow">Did you both eat sweet potatoes?</font>

63
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,480
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - Gong Joo saw you both.</font>

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,610
<font color="yellow">Right. We did.</font>

65
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,680
<font color="yellow">- With Ms Nam? - No.</font>

66
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,440
<font color="yellow">I was eating sweet potatoes.</font>

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
<font color="yellow">But she kept begging me to give her one bite.</font>

68
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,580
<font color="yellow">That's why I gave her some.</font>

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,910
<font color="yellow">You keep bothering people when they're eating something.</font>

70
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
<font color="yellow">I guess I do that sometimes.</font>

72
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,610
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam. Be careful of your actions, and don't make people misunderstand.</font>

73
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,980
<font color="yellow">My dad lived alone decently until now.</font>

74
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,880
<font color="yellow">Think of what will happen if you make rumours...</font>

75
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,710
<font color="yellow">about my father and a housekeeper.</font>

76
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,540
<font color="yellow">Even the thought of it is dreadful.</font>

77
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
<font color="yellow">During the 30 years after my mum passed away,</font>

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,410
<font color="yellow">he didn't cause any trouble with women.</font>

79
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,650
<font color="yellow">Although there wouldn't be such a thing with an old woman like you,</font>

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,110
<font color="yellow">you should still be careful.</font>

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,510
<font color="yellow">Dad, I need a word with you.</font>

82
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,740
<font color="yellow">Dad. There's nothing going on between you and her, right?</font>

84
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,410
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

85
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,580
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo said you two looked like lovers.</font>

86
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,680
<font color="yellow">Don't be nice to her. She might think differently.</font>

87
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,410
<font color="yellow">Men with wealth need to be careful of women.</font>

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,150
<font color="yellow">I told you it's nothing like that. Mind your own business.</font>

89
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,150
<font color="yellow">Be careful. Don't get blind-sided.</font>

90
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,580
<font color="yellow">It's so obvious what to expect from women like her.</font>

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,840
<font color="yellow">What's the time? I need to eat.</font>

92
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,080
<font color="yellow">- You're cooking? - Yes.</font>

93
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,710
<font color="yellow">- What are you making? - Kimchi fried rice.</font>

94
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,510
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

95
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,040
<font color="yellow">Don't disturb me.</font>

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

97
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,640
<font color="yellow">- Why? - You shouldn't put it back in.</font>

98
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,140
<font color="yellow">It's clean enough.</font>

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,040
<font color="yellow">You still shouldn't. You should throw it out.</font>

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,810
<font color="yellow">Don't stare at me. Go back in. I'll manage on my own.</font>

102
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,510
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

103
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,780
<font color="yellow">You have everything out on the table.</font>

104
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,640
<font color="yellow">You took out the pots,</font>

105
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,710
<font color="yellow">spice jars and frying pans.</font>

106
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,940
<font color="yellow">You don't need all this to make kimchi fried rice.</font>

107
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,580
<font color="yellow">Leave me to do it on my own.</font>

108
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,080
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

109
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,910
<font color="yellow">That'll take ages to clean up.</font>

110
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,440
<font color="yellow">Is it not ready yet?</font>

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,980
<font color="yellow">It won't open if you're scared of opening that.</font>

112
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,910
<font color="yellow">You need to hold it tightly and just open it using your strength.</font>

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,480
<font color="yellow">You'll hurt your hand. Let me do it for you.</font>

114
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,340
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

115
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,980
<font color="yellow">Go in. It's time for me to use the kitchen.</font>

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,340
<font color="yellow">Use a knife to get it out.</font>

117
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,910
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. My goodness.</font>

118
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,210
<font color="yellow">It's best not to look at this.</font>

119
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,740
<font color="yellow">He's taking ages to make kimchi fried rice. I'm so hungry.</font>

120
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,580
<font color="yellow">He's using the kitchen all to himself.</font>

121
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,640
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to take?</font>

122
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,880
<font color="yellow">Don't pester me. You're not helping one bit.</font>

123
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,210
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

124
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,580
<font color="yellow">- This looks tasty. - I want some.</font>

125
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,980
<font color="yellow">- Go away. - You have yours.</font>

126
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,780
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - I don't want to.</font>

127
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
<font color="yellow">You can't have any.</font>

128
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
<font color="yellow">That'll be a dollar and 60 cents.</font>

129
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,440
<font color="yellow">You're the best. You really are.</font>

130
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,980
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it tasty? - It is.</font>

131
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,880
<font color="yellow">This is fun.</font>

132
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,180
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why people don't want to do it.</font>

133
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,840
<font color="yellow">What shall we eat tomorrow?</font>

134
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,080
<font color="yellow">What's your problem?</font>

135
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,910
<font color="yellow">- Catch me. - Give it.</font>

136
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,340
<font color="yellow">- You're so annoying. - You have yours.</font>

137
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,380
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Give it.</font>

138
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,180
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.</font>

139
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

140
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,180
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

141
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,210
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I cleaned them.</font>

142
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,010
<font color="yellow">It's not clean enough.</font>

143
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,510
<font color="yellow">Don't be fussy. You'll only wear yourself out.</font>

144
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,480
<font color="yellow">Why do it twice? Just leave it if it's all right.</font>

145
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,580
<font color="yellow">I washed them nice and clean.</font>

146
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,780
<font color="yellow">Yes, I can see that.</font>

147
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,540
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat. - I don't want to. It's not tasty.</font>

148
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,140
<font color="yellow">Let's eat this today and ask Dad to take us out tomorrow.</font>

149
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,440
<font color="yellow">No. I want pork cutlet.</font>

150
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,910
<font color="yellow">We don't have money.</font>

151
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,710
<font color="yellow">Dad gave us money.</font>

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,340
<font color="yellow">We need to save up. Eat up.</font>

153
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,010
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

154
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,210
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

155
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,340
<font color="yellow">Who told you to behave like this?</font>

156
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,880
<font color="yellow">Why won't you listen to me?</font>

157
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,140
<font color="yellow">I'm having a hard time as it is.</font>

158
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,540
<font color="yellow">You should behave.</font>

159
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,340
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

160
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,250
<font color="yellow">Dad's having a hard time as it is. We should be considerate.</font>

161
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,910
<font color="yellow">What will he think if you're like this?</font>

162
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,210
<font color="yellow">I don't care. I want to go to Grandma's place.</font>

163
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,540
<font color="yellow">Come here, Da Rong.</font>

164
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,840
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

165
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,910
<font color="yellow">You need to listen to Cho Rong.</font>

166
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,810
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

167
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
<font color="yellow">Don't yell at Da Rong.</font>

168
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,280
<font color="yellow">Let's eat out. What would you like to eat?</font>

169
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,980
<font color="yellow">I want pork cutlet.</font>

170
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
<font color="yellow">Okay, pork cutlet it is.</font>

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,180
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you that this week.</font>

172
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,440
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

173
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,540
<font color="yellow">When did this start?</font>

174
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,810
<font color="yellow">Did this happen before? Does anywhere else hurt?</font>

175
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,140
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I'm just tired.</font>

176
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,780
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

177
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,680
<font color="yellow">How did you end up like this?</font>

178
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,510
<font color="yellow">You never used to step into the kitchen.</font>

179
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,110
<font color="yellow">Now, you make food for yourself and do the dishes.</font>

180
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,040
<font color="yellow">You'll make a good wife.</font>

181
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,710
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

182
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,540
<font color="yellow">If somebody wants to marry me, I'll gladly go.</font>

183
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,980
<font color="yellow">- When you fold laundry... - No more nagging.</font>

184
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,780
<font color="yellow">I'll do it my style.</font>

185
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,010
<font color="yellow">There's no style to folding laundry.</font>

186
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,980
<font color="yellow">You have to fold it properly. Watch.</font>

187
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,340
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

188
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,680
<font color="yellow">This is straight. It's nice to keep it this way.</font>

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,710
<font color="yellow">You should do it, then. Don't make Joong Nyeon do it.</font>

190
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,640
<font color="yellow">Don't be so fussy. I'm tired.</font>

191
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,240
<font color="yellow">He says he's tired.</font>

192
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,210
<font color="yellow">He has to cook, do the dishes, clean and do the laundry.</font>

193
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,110
<font color="yellow">You're going to kill Joong Nyeon.</font>

194
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,040
<font color="yellow">It's that hard to feed yourself.</font>

195
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,410
<font color="yellow">Imagine if you had to feed your family.</font>

196
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,810
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

197
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,580
<font color="yellow">And when you use the kitchen,</font>

198
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,410
<font color="yellow">I want you to keep to your designated time.</font>

199
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,280
<font color="yellow">I didn't think about that.</font>

200
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,010
<font color="yellow">You must've been hungry waiting for me to finish.</font>

201
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,510
<font color="yellow">You should have waited. We could've had kimchi fried rice together.</font>

202
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,440
<font color="yellow">I had something simple outside.</font>

203
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,310
<font color="yellow">This family doesn't care any more.</font>

204
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,010
<font color="yellow">You fold laundry however you want, and you eat whatever.</font>

205
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,210
<font color="yellow">How convenient.</font>

206
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,280
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - What's wrong with that?</font>

207
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,780
<font color="yellow">It's great.</font>

208
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,180
<font color="yellow">Turn right.</font>

209
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,510
<font color="yellow">Turn the steering wheel slowly.</font>

210
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,280
<font color="yellow">What now? Was that wrong?</font>

211
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,640
<font color="yellow">When you turn the steering wheel, turn slower...</font>

212
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,980
<font color="yellow">than you think you should. It's a tiny movement.</font>

213
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,310
<font color="yellow">You have to be confident. It's an empty space.</font>

214
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,280
<font color="yellow">Turn left.</font>

215
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,080
<font color="yellow">Your hand.</font>

216
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,110
<font color="yellow">Focus on driving.</font>

217
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,610
<font color="yellow">Let's take a U-turn.</font>

218
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
<font color="yellow">Drive up to there.</font>

219
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,110
<font color="yellow">Be careful. Be careful.</font>

220
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,980
<font color="yellow">Brake. Brake.</font>

221
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,980
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

222
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,180
<font color="yellow">I nearly had a heart attack.</font>

223
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

224
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,640
<font color="yellow">I already had one.</font>

225
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,640
<font color="yellow">No daydreaming when you drive.</font>

226
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,310
<font color="yellow">I didn't daydream.</font>

227
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,010
<font color="yellow">Weren't you thinking about me?</font>

228
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,580
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Instructor. This one's on me.</font>

229
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,510
<font color="yellow">That's why I ordered jjajangmyeon, the tastiest and cheapest dish.</font>

230
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,980
<font color="yellow">Driving's fun.</font>

231
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,040
<font color="yellow">I'm still scared, but it's fun.</font>

232
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,310
<font color="yellow">When you go to bed, you'll be thinking about the steering wheel.</font>

233
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
<font color="yellow">When you first start, you are eager to drive.</font>

234
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,380
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

235
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,980
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat here. - Let's go somewhere else.</font>

236
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,040
<font color="yellow">Let's just stay. We don't have much time.</font>

237
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,380
<font color="yellow">Hello. We see each other again.</font>

238
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,910
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

239
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,340
<font color="yellow">You must be out for lunch. Join us.</font>

240
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

241
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,310
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

242
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,880
<font color="yellow">I'll have jjamppong. What about you, Gab Dol?</font>

243
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
<font color="yellow">- I'll have the same. - Sure.</font>

244
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,580
<font color="yellow">You two look good together.</font>

245
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,210
<font color="yellow">You look good together as well.</font>

246
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,680
<font color="yellow">Doesn't your mum tell you to go on blind dates?</font>

247
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, I guess.</font>

248
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,410
<font color="yellow">I think people are happy when they meet a partner at their level.</font>

249
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,010
<font color="yellow">I heard couples who work in the same field last longer.</font>

250
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,410
<font color="yellow">My parents are both teachers.</font>

251
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,940
<font color="yellow">They are companions for life.</font>

252
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,080
<font color="yellow">They get a lot of pension, too.</font>

253
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,540
<font color="yellow">I want to be like my parents.</font>

254
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,610
<font color="yellow">I found my office space.</font>

255
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,240
<font color="yellow">You have the location?</font>

256
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,210
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a good location. I'll decorate it nicely.</font>

257
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
<font color="yellow">Once I finish practising driving, I'll get a car...</font>

258
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,340
<font color="yellow">and hire some employees.</font>

259
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,740
<font color="yellow">I thought you said you don't want employees.</font>

260
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,080
<font color="yellow">I'll be the owner. I need people working for me.</font>

261
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,950
<font color="yellow">Businesses are the best for making money.</font>

262
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,480
<font color="yellow">You can be a salaried employee,</font>

263
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,240
<font color="yellow">but all they have is their pension.</font>

264
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,310
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why people are so obsessed about it.</font>

265
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,710
<font color="yellow">You should have the best life you can have.</font>

266
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,040
<font color="yellow">How cool.</font>

267
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,140
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

268
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,240
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

269
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,880
<font color="yellow">It's so hot.</font>

270
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,510
<font color="yellow">You should have taken your time. Here's water.</font>

271
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,340
<font color="yellow">It's hot water.</font>

272
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,450
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

273
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,380
<font color="yellow">I like their jjajangmyeon.</font>

274
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,540
<font color="yellow">- You got sauce on your lips. - Here?</font>

275
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,740
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

276
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,110
<font color="yellow">You're like a baby.</font>

277
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,410
<font color="yellow">Should we eat and go outdoors?</font>

278
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,980
<font color="yellow">I can practise driving.</font>

279
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

280
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,010
<font color="yellow">I already paid.</font>

281
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,890
<font color="yellow">We're paying separately.</font>

282
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,190
<font color="yellow">Just a moment, please.</font>

283
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,660
<font color="yellow">(Chinese Restaurant)</font>

284
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
<font color="yellow">Where should we go?</font>

285
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

286
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,860
<font color="yellow">You wanted to practise driving.</font>

287
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,120
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

288
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,260
<font color="yellow">How much should I invest in you?</font>

289
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,220
<font color="yellow">You have to lease the office and hire people.</font>

290
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,520
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Just take me back.</font>

291
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,790
<font color="yellow">- Are they going out? - No.</font>

292
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,420
<font color="yellow">Why are they acting like that, then?</font>

293
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,460
<font color="yellow">I thought she was your girlfriend.</font>

294
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,890
<font color="yellow">Us women know women.</font>

295
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,460
<font color="yellow">They're not going out.</font>

296
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,760
<font color="yellow">The guy likes her, so he's following her around.</font>

297
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,760
<font color="yellow">You're her boyfriend,</font>

298
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,420
<font color="yellow">and she's letting another man follow her around?</font>

299
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,890
<font color="yellow">And she tells you, "I don't care about him."</font>

300
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,890
<font color="yellow">"He's following me around because he likes me. So what?"</font>

301
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,620
<font color="yellow">Was this her excuse?</font>

302
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,990
<font color="yellow">You are so nice, Gab Dol.</font>

303
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,120
<font color="yellow">How could you let her do that...</font>

304
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,560
<font color="yellow">when you've been going out for 10 years?</font>

305
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,560
<font color="yellow">If she had common sense,</font>

306
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,120
<font color="yellow">she would have never done that.</font>

307
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,890
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

308
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,160
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest about this.</font>

309
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,830
<font color="yellow">- I have nothing to say. - Did you...</font>

310
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,420
<font color="yellow">Fine. You're going to be all mad if I swear again.</font>

311
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,560
<font color="yellow">What are you doing hanging around with him?</font>

312
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,560
<font color="yellow">Why are you around him? Are you going out with him?</font>

313
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,490
<font color="yellow">What is it you want to say?</font>

314
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,330
<font color="yellow">During our 10-year relationship,</font>

315
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,960
<font color="yellow">you're the one who hung around with other girls.</font>

316
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,860
<font color="yellow">Do you finally get it?</font>

317
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,190
<font color="yellow">That's totally different. I hung out with them to get free food.</font>

318
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,190
<font color="yellow">I'm doing that, too.</font>

319
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,830
<font color="yellow">He's going to invest in me.</font>

320
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,060
<font color="yellow">You're the one hanging out with your female co-worker all the time.</font>

321
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,660
<font color="yellow">I was doing my job. It's not an excuse.</font>

322
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,790
<font color="yellow">My mum nags me about going on blind dates, but I keep refusing.</font>

323
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,720
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

324
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,860
<font color="yellow">You use driving practice as an excuse to go on dates?</font>

325
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,790
<font color="yellow">This is cheating. It's obvious.</font>

326
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,020
<font color="yellow">I've been letting it go only because I'm a considerate person.</font>

327
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,290
<font color="yellow">Other people already think you two are a couple.</font>

328
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,260
<font color="yellow">"Other people"? Who? Dal Tong?</font>

329
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,490
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

330
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,520
<font color="yellow">You leave behind your boyfriend of 10 years,</font>

331
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,560
<font color="yellow">and you go on dates with him.</font>

332
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
<font color="yellow">Then you say, "I don't care about him. He's following me around..."</font>

333
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,790
<font color="yellow">"because he likes me. So what?"</font>

334
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,330
<font color="yellow">But if you had common sense, you would have never done that.</font>

335
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,760
<font color="yellow">Is that what your co-worker said?</font>

336
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

337
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,560
<font color="yellow">That's why you're doing this?</font>

338
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,720
<font color="yellow">You never change, do you?</font>

339
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,060
<font color="yellow">You used to tell me exactly what your mum said.</font>

340
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,190
<font color="yellow">Now, you tell me exactly what your co-worker says?</font>

341
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,420
<font color="yellow">You must have made fun of me together.</font>

342
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,190
<font color="yellow">She wanted to marry you and get pension when you retire.</font>

343
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,990
<font color="yellow">- That'll work. - Tell me what you have in mind.</font>

344
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,690
<font color="yellow">It's like you said. I know he likes me, but I'm letting him be.</font>

345
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
<font color="yellow">- So what? - How could you?</font>

346
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,520
<font color="yellow">I can't talk to you.</font>

347
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,220
<font color="yellow">Finish talking.</font>

348
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,120
<font color="yellow">What should I say? Do you want the truth?</font>

349
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,190
<font color="yellow">You can't break up with me because of what our friends would say.</font>

350
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,490
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask if you were interested in your co-worker,</font>

351
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,490
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't ask because of my pride.</font>

352
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,760
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to end it off?</font>

353
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,720
<font color="yellow">Should I dump you so that our friends don't criticise you?</font>

354
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,160
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

355
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,490
<font color="yellow">Is that the kind of person you think I am?</font>

356
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,690
<font color="yellow">What did you do for our relationship?</font>

357
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,620
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

358
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,220
<font color="yellow">You didn't do anything. You were being a coward.</font>

359
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,960
<font color="yellow">You're afraid of what our friends would say so you can't dump me.</font>

360
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,060
<font color="yellow">You're only waiting for me to get away. Am I not right?</font>

361
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,320
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have done this if I were you.</font>

362
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,260
<font color="yellow">Even if your mum beats you to death,</font>

363
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,290
<font color="yellow">you should have brought me to your mum at least once.</font>

364
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,790
<font color="yellow">Only then, could you say you tried.</font>

365
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,590
<font color="yellow">You're just making excuses.</font>

366
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,620
<font color="yellow">I'm disgusted.</font>

367
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,960
<font color="yellow">Do you know that you've changed?</font>

368
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,590
<font color="yellow">Our friends say that, too. They say that you've changed.</font>

369
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,560
<font color="yellow">Don't come back again.</font>

370
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
<font color="yellow">Let's file the papers within this week.</font>

371
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,420
<font color="yellow">I'll see you in court.</font>

372
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,820
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

373
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,960
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

374
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,520
<font color="yellow">- Is it six dollars for the bag? - Yes.</font>

375
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,820
<font color="yellow">If I buy a lot, can you give me a discount?</font>

376
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,560
<font color="yellow">That's how you fry it.</font>

377
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,190
<font color="yellow">You know everything now.</font>

378
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,490
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Enjoy.</font>

379
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

380
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,860
<font color="yellow">- Can I have fried chicken? - Sure.</font>

381
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,920
<font color="yellow">- One fried chicken, please. - Okay.</font>

382
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,590
<font color="yellow">You didn't go to bed yet?</font>

383
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,760
<font color="yellow">No, I have to study.</font>

384
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,360
<font color="yellow">I've never seen you study.</font>

385
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,090
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your time. Save some electricity.</font>

386
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,990
<font color="yellow">If you studied before, you would have made it to college.</font>

387
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,660
<font color="yellow">That's what I was thinking.</font>

388
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,890
<font color="yellow">If I studied like this, I would've gone to Seoul National University.</font>

389
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,760
<font color="yellow">That's far-fetched.</font>

390
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,890
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

391
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,690
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for your knee surgery as soon as I make enough money.</font>

392
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,590
<font color="yellow">Just look after yourself.</font>

393
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,790
<font color="yellow">On top of that,</font>

394
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,890
<font color="yellow">we'll have warm water during winter.</font>

395
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,120
<font color="yellow">I'll let you use the heater so that you don't have to wear a sweater.</font>

396
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,260
<font color="yellow">My nose is cold.</font>

397
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,820
<font color="yellow">Some people don't even have a house like this.</font>

398
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,790
<font color="yellow">Look at Mr Geum.</font>

399
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,860
<font color="yellow">He thinks we're well off.</font>

400
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,490
<font color="yellow">You just wait. I'll make you rich.</font>

401
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,160
<font color="yellow">I don't know what kind of a lunatic is investing in your business.</font>

402
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,260
<font color="yellow">He must be out of his mind.</font>

403
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,360
<font color="yellow">Watch me. I'll become successful.</font>

404
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,790
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

405
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

406
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,020
<font color="yellow">It's cold. You must be working hard.</font>

407
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,820
<font color="yellow">You deliver water during the day and alcohol at night.</font>

408
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,290
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do with all that money?</font>

409
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,420
<font color="yellow">How's your business doing?</font>

410
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,120
<font color="yellow">It's good. Good night. It's cold.</font>

411
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

412
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,660
<font color="yellow">Welcome home.</font>

413
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,020
<font color="yellow">Don't do that. You have bad eye sight.</font>

414
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,490
<font color="yellow">Why won't you listen to me?</font>

415
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120
<font color="yellow">I should get new glasses.</font>

416
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,160
<font color="yellow">- It'll cost more though. - Stop doing that.</font>

417
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,360
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to do at home. I'll pitch in some money.</font>

418
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,790
<font color="yellow">Stop doing that.</font>

419
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,060
<font color="yellow">I spent two hours on them.</font>

420
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,820
<font color="yellow">It's at least 50 cents.</font>

421
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,720
<font color="yellow">You should be helping me, not knocking it over.</font>

422
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,420
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

423
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,720
<font color="yellow">I won't play with you.</font>

424
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,960
<font color="yellow">Don't do this again.</font>

425
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,220
<font color="yellow">I'll make money.</font>

426
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

427
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,720
<font color="yellow">I think I need to tell him.</font>

428
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,620
<font color="yellow">He threaded the beads overnight.</font>

429
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,160
<font color="yellow">He must have been tired from work.</font>

430
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
<font color="yellow">Would it make any difference?</font>

431
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,590
<font color="yellow">He still has to know the truth.</font>

432
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,620
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be a dad who makes his son suffer.</font>

433
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,360
<font color="yellow">(What kind of chicken will I sell?)</font>

434
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,790
<font color="yellow">What is your predicted income?</font>

435
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,490
<font color="yellow">If you invest 50,000 dollars...</font>

436
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,960
<font color="yellow">and take out the expected cost, the margin is...</font>

437
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,490
<font color="yellow">Do you get 100,000 dollars?</font>

438
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,520
<font color="yellow">No. Even if I get wholesale products,</font>

439
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,160
<font color="yellow">I can't bring the cost down too much. It sacrifices the quality.</font>

440
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,560
<font color="yellow">Even I don't go to restaurants that have low quality food.</font>

441
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,620
<font color="yellow">I'm going to use the best ingredients...</font>

442
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,520
<font color="yellow">and use less employees. I'll work extra hard.</font>

443
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,190
<font color="yellow">I realised that's what business comes down to.</font>

444
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,690
<font color="yellow">I'll do what I can by myself.</font>

445
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,790
<font color="yellow">I'll use a part-time worker during busy hours.</font>

446
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,090
<font color="yellow">I'll save enough for a monthly wage.</font>

447
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,620
<font color="yellow">- Approved. - Really?</font>

448
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,560
<font color="yellow">It's worth investing.</font>

449
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,560
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

450
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,360
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy. Are you serious?</font>

451
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,490
<font color="yellow">- Let's go somewhere else. - Why?</font>

452
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,060
<font color="yellow">Are you sure? Okay.</font>

453
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,590
<font color="yellow">Grandpa is acting weird.</font>

454
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,420
<font color="yellow">He dresses younger than his age and he even texts.</font>

455
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,020
<font color="yellow">I think he's seeing a younger woman.</font>

456
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,660
<font color="yellow">Dad, are you seeing somebody? Is it a young woman?</font>

457
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,690
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

458
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,490
<font color="yellow">You were at a coffee shop, hugging and kissing her.</font>

459
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,960
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo saw you.</font>

460
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,320
<font color="yellow">How could you do that?</font>

461
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,760
<font color="yellow">I didn't do that, but what if I did?</font>

462
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,990
<font color="yellow">Who is that woman?</font>

463
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,260
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me who to meet or what to do.</font>

464
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,160
<font color="yellow">You promised me.</font>

465
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,690
<font color="yellow">I've done enough.</font>

466
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,160
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let me see who it is.</font>

467
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,790
<font color="yellow">You don't have to. It's my privacy. Leave.</font>

468
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,890
<font color="yellow">That's as far as it goes. Don't think otherwise.</font>

469
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,820
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I'm saying?</font>

470
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,260
<font color="yellow">Can I sit down for a minute?</font>

471
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,020
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

472
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,220
<font color="yellow">- You're such a playboy. - What are you talking about?</font>

473
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,860
<font color="yellow">You flirt with any women because you have money.</font>

474
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,760
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're seeing a young woman.</font>

475
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,360
<font color="yellow">Are you going to do this to me, too? It's not what you think.</font>

476
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,890
<font color="yellow">I heard what your daughter said.</font>

477
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,320
<font color="yellow">Why did you treat me like that when you already have someone?</font>

478
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,890
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

479
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,190
<font color="yellow">- It's just a misunderstanding. - No, it's not.</font>

480
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,620
<font color="yellow">I'm not a fool. I can take the hint.</font>

481
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,120
<font color="yellow">I'm getting old. I don't want to get into a messy situation.</font>

482
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,420
<font color="yellow">I need to make a living, so I can't quit right now.</font>

483
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,260
<font color="yellow">Please find a replacement within this month.</font>

484
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,720
<font color="yellow">- Relief Patch. - Don't ever call me that again.</font>

485
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,060
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

486
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,390
<font color="yellow">Don't think about anything silly. Keep your promise to me.</font>

487
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,820
<font color="yellow">Wow, Man Joo.</font>

488
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,090
<font color="yellow">It looks weird, right?</font>

489
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,160
<font color="yellow">I feel so awkward and uncomfortable.</font>

490
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,960
<font color="yellow">You look nice. What's the occasion?</font>

491
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,090
<font color="yellow">My friend pestered me to go on a blind date.</font>

492
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,320
<font color="yellow">Did you go on a blind date?</font>

493
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,160
<font color="yellow">- I thought you weren't interested. - I wasn't.</font>

494
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,320
<font color="yellow">But you're married, and you don't work at the hospital any more.</font>

495
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,190
<font color="yellow">All my friends are married.</font>

496
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,790
<font color="yellow">I just thought I was acting pitiful all by myself.</font>

497
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,320
<font color="yellow">So I thought, "I should at least meet some guys."</font>

498
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,460
<font color="yellow">- So you're thinking about marriage. - Not exactly.</font>

499
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,320
<font color="yellow">- Are you going to marry that guy? - I just met him once.</font>

500
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,760
<font color="yellow">- What does he do? - He's the hospital director's son.</font>

501
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,520
<font color="yellow">He is a plastic surgeon.</font>

502
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,760
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Let's go out to eat.</font>

503
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,990
<font color="yellow">You were on a blind date. Didn't he buy you a meal?</font>

504
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,190
<font color="yellow">He got paged from the hospital, so he had to go.</font>

505
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,920
<font color="yellow">He said he was sorry and said he'll buy me a nice meal next time.</font>

506
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,860
<font color="yellow">- So he asked you out again. - Kind of.</font>

507
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,820
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - I can't eat.</font>

508
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,790
<font color="yellow">Even my niece got upset because of my social network page.</font>

509
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,490
<font color="yellow">You can't take that lightly.</font>

510
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,190
<font color="yellow">I told you not to do it.</font>

511
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,990
<font color="yellow">Don't do it any more.</font>

512
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,220
<font color="yellow">It's already all over the place. I can't do anything about it.</font>

513
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,690
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can delete them.</font>

514
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,220
<font color="yellow">- I'll try to delete them. - How are you going to do that?</font>

515
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing here?</font>

516
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,390
<font color="yellow">I told you not to stay together, didn't I?</font>

517
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,260
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever come back!</font>

518
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,890
<font color="yellow">I heard your stepmother ran away, too.</font>

519
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,460
<font color="yellow">Your birth mother ran away a long time ago.</font>

520
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,720
<font color="yellow">Your family went bankrupt, and your stepmother ran away.</font>

521
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,090
<font color="yellow">How pitiful you are.</font>

522
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,720
<font color="yellow">- Hey! Get off of me! - Stop.</font>

523
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,860
<font color="yellow">- Let me go! - Stop it.</font>

524
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,990
<font color="yellow">- Stop. - My gosh.</font>

525
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,520
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

526
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,320
<font color="yellow">What happened to your face? What's the matter?</font>

527
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,360
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin.</font>

528
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,390
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin...</font>

529
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,760
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

530
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,960
<font color="yellow">Hello. How can I help you?</font>

531
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,620
<font color="yellow">I'm Cho Rong's stepmother.</font>

532
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,420
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

533
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,760
<font color="yellow">I'm Cho Rong's stepmother.</font>

534
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,460
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong has been living with me ever since last year.</font>

535
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,360
<font color="yellow">Is that Cho Rong's fault?</font>

536
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,090
<font color="yellow">We're having some difficulties at home,</font>

537
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,620
<font color="yellow">so we're living in a rooftop room right now.</font>

538
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,590
<font color="yellow">Is that something that the children should tease her with?</font>

539
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there are other children with a single parent...</font>

540
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,560
<font color="yellow">or a step-parent in Cho Rong's class.</font>

541
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,190
<font color="yellow">Why should they be teased...</font>

542
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
<font color="yellow">and bullied because of that?</font>

543
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,190
<font color="yellow">Can you be sure that...</font>

544
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,320
<font color="yellow">it won't happen to any of your own children?</font>

545
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,460
<font color="yellow">Girls. Do I look like a mean witch?</font>

546
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,060
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

547
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,590
<font color="yellow">Stepmothers don't look mean and ugly.</font>

548
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,660
<font color="yellow">Bullying someone on the social network service is...</font>

549
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
<font color="yellow">the same thing as hurting that person's heart.</font>

550
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,190
<font color="yellow">It really hurts.</font>

551
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,390
<font color="yellow">Who is Joo Hee? I won't scold you.</font>

552
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,660
<font color="yellow">She my daughter. What is it?</font>

553
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,620
<font color="yellow">I heard you're a good singer.</font>

554
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,060
<font color="yellow">Your dream is to become an idol singer, right?</font>

555
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,230
<font color="yellow">I heard you're popular in your class, too.</font>

556
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
<font color="yellow">Ga Eun.</font>

557
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,490
<font color="yellow">I heard you're a fast runner and a good drawer.</font>

558
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,160
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong envied you.</font>

559
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,790
<font color="yellow">You must be Jeong Rim.</font>

560
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,520
<font color="yellow">Your make-up looks nice.</font>

561
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,590
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong told me about how good you are at doing make-up.</font>

562
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,730
<font color="yellow">She complimented that you do make-up for your friends, too.</font>

563
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,190
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong writes a lot about you guys on her diary.</font>

564
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,590
<font color="yellow">She wants to be close to you.</font>

565
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,420
<font color="yellow">Please don't hurt Cho Rong.</font>

566
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,060
<font color="yellow">She's your friend.</font>

567
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,860
<font color="yellow">I told you not to do that.</font>

568
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,320
<font color="yellow">You should be studying. What's wrong with you?</font>

569
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,190
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

570
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,920
<font color="yellow">Apologise to Cho Rong.</font>

571
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

572
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,420
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I won't do it again.</font>

573
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

574
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, too.</font>

575
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,520
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.</font>

576
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,920
<font color="yellow">My daughter was also bullied last year. She had a very hard time.</font>

577
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,020
<font color="yellow">But I couldn't be as brave as you.</font>

578
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,820
<font color="yellow">You're amazing.</font>

579
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,760
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the market. Do you want anything?</font>

580
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,560
<font color="yellow">I'll make some side dishes today.</font>

581
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,520
<font color="yellow">- I'll come with you. - I want to...</font>

582
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
<font color="yellow">- Not you, Mal Nyeon. - She doesn't want you to come.</font>

583
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,690
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon. This is a betrayal.</font>

584
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,320
<font color="yellow">Give me that. I'll carry it.</font>

585
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,420
<font color="yellow">Save your face. You don't carry this stuff.</font>

586
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,860
<font color="yellow">I lost my face a long time ago.</font>

587
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,420
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. Come again. - Okay.</font>

588
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,390
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

589
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,620
<font color="yellow">I guess you came grocery shopping.</font>

590
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,890
<font color="yellow">It's obvious. Why would you ask?</font>

591
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,090
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

592
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,590
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

593
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,060
<font color="yellow">Hello. You're Gab Dol's mother, aren't you?</font>

594
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,760
<font color="yellow">I met you when you visited the district office before.</font>

595
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,290
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Young Ran. I work with Gab Dol.</font>

596
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,820
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

597
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,660
<font color="yellow">Please get in. I was on my way home. I'll give you a ride.</font>

598
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,060
<font color="yellow">My house isn't far away.</font>

599
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,990
<font color="yellow">It's on a hill, so cars can't go up there.</font>

600
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,260
<font color="yellow">- I'm a strong girl. - You don't have to.</font>

601
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,760
<font color="yellow">This is my house. We live a humble life.</font>

602
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,730
<font color="yellow">I like it. The air is clear, and it has a nice view.</font>

603
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,390
<font color="yellow">It's just air, and it's not such a pretty view.</font>

604
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,060
<font color="yellow">I'll be going, then.</font>

605
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,660
<font color="yellow">You came all the way here. Do you want to come in for some tea?</font>

606
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,890
<font color="yellow">May I?</font>

607
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,160
<font color="yellow">I would've been disappointed if you hadn't asked me.</font>

608
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,390
<font color="yellow">- Hurry home. - Why?</font>

609
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,560
<font color="yellow">This is why all our friends call you a jerk.</font>

610
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,790
<font color="yellow">I have food to deliver.</font>

611
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,990
<font color="yellow">We don't buy fruits often, so there isn't anything to give you.</font>

612
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,160
<font color="yellow">A cup of tea is more than enough.</font>

613
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,390
<font color="yellow">It smells nice.</font>

614
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,360
<font color="yellow">Someone gave me this as a gift.</font>

615
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,620
<font color="yellow">It has been in the cupboard for a while.</font>

616
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,920
<font color="yellow">This place is a bit shabby, right?</font>

617
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,620
<font color="yellow">It's an old house, and it's cold.</font>

618
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,690
<font color="yellow">I turned on the heater, so it will get warm soon.</font>

619
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,260
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

620
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,860
<font color="yellow">You seem like a very nice person.</font>

621
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,620
<font color="yellow">- How old are you? - I'm 26 years old.</font>

622
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,060
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You must be very smart.</font>

623
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,420
<font color="yellow">Did you pass your exam right after you graduated university?</font>

624
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,390
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was lucky.</font>

625
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,520
<font color="yellow">Some people study for 10 years, but they still fail the exam.</font>

626
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,590
<font color="yellow">What do your parents do?</font>

627
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,620
<font color="yellow">They're both teachers.</font>

628
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,190
<font color="yellow">How great!</font>

629
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,420
<font color="yellow">Your family is going to get a tremendous amount of pensions.</font>

630
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,360
<font color="yellow">Yes. They wanted me to become a teacher as well,</font>

631
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,320
<font color="yellow">but I suppose I was meant to become a public official to meet Gab Dol.</font>

632
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,860
<font color="yellow">Do you like Gab Dol?</font>

633
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:08,090
<font color="yellow">Yes. He caught my eyes on his first day.</font>

634
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,760
<font color="yellow">I was thinking I should marry a public official as well.</font>

635
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,230
<font color="yellow">My gosh. That'd be great.</font>

636
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,190
<font color="yellow">Don't feel burdened because I'm a single mother.</font>

637
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,820
<font color="yellow">I will never live off my son and his wife.</font>

638
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,260
<font color="yellow">It's okay if we live with you. You can help us raise our children.</font>

639
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,460
<font color="yellow">I think it's good to live with an elder in the house.</font>

640
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,730
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

641
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,360
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - You must be surprised.</font>

642
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,090
<font color="yellow">She gave me a ride,</font>

643
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,190
<font color="yellow">so I invited her in for a cup of tea.</font>

644
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,020
<font color="yellow">I was just leaving.</font>

645
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,320
<font color="yellow">Luckily, I was able to get acquainted with your mother.</font>

646
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,420
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you again.</font>

647
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,890
<font color="yellow">You're welcome any time.</font>

648
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:53,060
<font color="yellow">One thing I'm good at is cooking. I'll make you nice food.</font>

649
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,120
<font color="yellow">I'll be looking forward to that. Goodbye.</font>

650
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,320
<font color="yellow">See her off.</font>

651
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,590
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

652
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,090
<font color="yellow">I hope you won't do something like this again.</font>

653
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,690
<font color="yellow">Isn't it natural to carry the baggage of a colleague's mother?</font>

654
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,690
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

655
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,790
<font color="yellow">She's such a nice person.</font>

656
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,360
<font color="yellow">She sounds so gentle and says all the nice things.</font>

657
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,890
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because she's a public official. She's so classy.</font>

658
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,260
<font color="yellow">Why did you invite her in?</font>

659
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,460
<font color="yellow">She said she liked you ever since your first day.</font>

660
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,520
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't she? No one is as handsome as you.</font>

661
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,790
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

662
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,260
<font color="yellow">She wants to marry a public official as well.</font>

663
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,690
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon studied for 10 years, but she failed every time.</font>

664
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,230
<font color="yellow">She isn't gentle, and she doesn't know how to flatter.</font>

665
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,290
<font color="yellow">She's always sulky and stubborn.</font>

666
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,890
<font color="yellow">Why did you date her for 10 years?</font>

667
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,690
<font color="yellow">You have such a bad taste in women.</font>

668
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,120
<font color="yellow">You should date a woman like Young Ran.</font>

669
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,920
<font color="yellow">If you like her that much, date her yourself.</font>

670
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,760
<font color="yellow">Get a hold of yourself. Don't kick away good fortune.</font>

671
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,490
<font color="yellow">We had dinner already, but I'm still hungry.</font>

672
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,560
<font color="yellow">Taste this for me.</font>

673
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,060
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. I forgot to add salt.</font>

674
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,690
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim.</font>

675
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

676
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,260
<font color="yellow">It's hurting my eyes.</font>

677
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,790
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing?</font>

678
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,620
<font color="yellow">Don't let her come between us.</font>

679
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,990
<font color="yellow">- Don't come between us. - My gosh.</font>

680
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,290
<font color="yellow">Fine. Goodness.</font>

681
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,820
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

682
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,990
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

683
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,320
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

684
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,020
<font color="yellow">Did you see how that women didn't even say hello to me?</font>

685
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,490
<font color="yellow">You didn't, either.</font>

686
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,820
<font color="yellow">What do you think she thought when she saw us...</font>

687
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,760
<font color="yellow">shopping for groceries together?</font>

688
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,820
<font color="yellow">"She's such an unlucky woman."</font>

689
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,260
<font color="yellow">"She still has a husband who follows around her."</font>

690
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,460
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'm a bit mean.</font>

691
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,120
<font color="yellow">Looking at her carrying things on each arm...</font>

692
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,760
<font color="yellow">made me feel bad. She looked so small.</font>

693
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,720
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because I was with you. I strutted along without realising.</font>

694
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,660
<font color="yellow">I guess it looks bad if you grow old and live by yourself.</font>

695
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,960
<font color="yellow">You were jealous of women who lived alone.</font>

696
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,790
<font color="yellow">I told you about my friend...</font>

697
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,790
<font color="yellow">who looked after her sick husband for seven years, right?</font>

698
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,590
<font color="yellow">Yes. You said he died last summer.</font>

699
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,160
<font color="yellow">She said children are useless.</font>

700
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,790
<font color="yellow">She said a husband is the best even if he's sick.</font>

701
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,420
<font color="yellow">They weren't even a happily married couple,</font>

702
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,160
<font color="yellow">but she realised how good it is to have a husband.</font>

703
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,860
<font color="yellow">Men are worse than women.</font>

704
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,890
<font color="yellow">An old men without a wife is only an empty shell.</font>

705
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,990
<font color="yellow">No one would treat him like human any more.</font>

706
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,520
<font color="yellow">So be grateful to me.</font>

707
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,190
<font color="yellow">We're not married.</font>

708
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,660
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

709
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,590
<font color="yellow">Don't you try to cling onto me.</font>

710
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,890
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to say.</font>

711
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim.</font>

712
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,090
<font color="yellow">Now that you're not my wife, I somehow want you more.</font>

713
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,560
<font color="yellow">Shall I sleep in your room tonight?</font>

714
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,660
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

715
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,620
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

716
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,760
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin. You were great at school today.</font>

717
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,460
<font color="yellow">You're the best.</font>

718
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,260
<font color="yellow">My friends apologised to me, and I'm so happy now.</font>

719
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,990
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll come and live with us.</font>

720
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,160
<font color="yellow">Did you make the side dishes?</font>

721
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,590
<font color="yellow">What were you and Dad laughing about?</font>

722
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,390
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - What?</font>

723
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,490
<font color="yellow">Why would Cho Rong send you a text message?</font>

724
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,520
<font color="yellow">Why did you look through my phone?</font>

725
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,920
<font color="yellow">It says you went to her school.</font>

726
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,660
<font color="yellow">I had to take care of something.</font>

727
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,560
<font color="yellow">You're getting divorced. Why would you go to her school?</font>

728
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,660
<font color="yellow">"I hope you'll come and live with us"?</font>

729
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,620
<font color="yellow">She must be saying that because they have been talking about it.</font>

730
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,060
<font color="yellow">I get that you're in a difficult situation,</font>

731
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,060
<font color="yellow">but you should let her go now.</font>

732
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,660
<font color="yellow">You may think I'm cold-hearted, but I have no choice.</font>

733
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,320
<font color="yellow">No. I will file the papers soon.</font>

734
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,090
<font color="yellow">Then please do it faster.</font>

735
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,560
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon has always been soft-hearted and sympathetic.</font>

736
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,860
<font color="yellow">She always helps people in need.</font>

737
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,990
<font color="yellow">It looks like she went to Cho Rong's school...</font>

738
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,720
<font color="yellow">because she came to her crying.</font>

739
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,120
<font color="yellow">Please manage your children.</font>

740
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

741
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,820
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I caused you trouble.</font>

742
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,420
<font color="yellow">I won't let that happen again.</font>

743
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,020
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

744
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,060
<font color="yellow">Dad. I'm so excited.</font>

745
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,660
<font color="yellow">- Did something good happen, Dad? - Yes.</font>

746
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,790
<font color="yellow">I found many new clients, and the company is doing great.</font>

747
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,820
<font color="yellow">Let's hold out for a little longer.</font>

748
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:35,990
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

749
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,660
<font color="yellow">- Is it delicious, Da Rong? - Yes, it's delicious.</font>

750
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,190
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating, Dad?</font>

751
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,520
<font color="yellow">I'm just happy to watch you eat.</font>

752
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,260
<font color="yellow">Don't be depressed because things aren't good at home.</font>

753
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,160
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, you should listen to your sister.</font>

754
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,920

<font color="yellow">I'm going to quit.</font>

897

905
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,060

<font color="yellow">How could you keep that from me?</font>

908
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,220
<font color="yellow">I thought you were seeing a younger woman.</font>

909
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,220
<font color="yellow">I had no idea you were helping my daughter.</font>

910
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,960
<font color="yellow">Why did you keep that from me?</font>

911
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:52,120
<font color="yellow">Your daughter can't be trusted.</font>

912
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,060
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know how to be discreet.</font>

913
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,620
<font color="yellow">She's never listened to anyone.</font>

914
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,120
<font color="yellow">She said that she's learned a lot...</font>

915
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,760
<font color="yellow">thanks to you.</font>

916
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,660
<font color="yellow">I don't know how to thank you.</font>

917
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:06,290
<font color="yellow">There's no need to do that.</font>

918
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,290
<font color="yellow">Your children are...</font>

919
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,290
<font color="yellow">mine, too.</font>

920
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,960
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam, when did you get here?</font>

921
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,060
<font color="yellow">Just now.</font>

922
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,990
<font color="yellow">What were you doing in my dad's room?</font>

923
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,360
<font color="yellow">I'll hurry up and prepare breakfast.</font>

924
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,190
<font color="yellow">Is this the express delivery service?</font>

925
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,320
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, I cooked this.</font>

926
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,060
<font color="yellow">Eat it with Da Rong while it's hot.</font>

927
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,960
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, it's fried chicken. It smells good.</font>

928
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,720
<font color="yellow">You can eat it by yourself.</font>

929
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,620
<font color="yellow">Why did you come all the way here?</font>

930
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,320
<font color="yellow">I wanted to get your approval.</font>

931
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:50,490
<font color="yellow">Please eat this and give me your review.</font>

932
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,620
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

933
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,160
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

934
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,120
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

935
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,260
<font color="yellow">- Who is she? - You can go.</font>

936
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,120
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please visit my store soon.</font>

937
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,820
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

938
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,190
<font color="yellow">- Are you seeing her these days? - You have the wrong idea.</font>

939
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,420
<font color="yellow">Are you going to deny even when I saw with my own eyes?</font>

940
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,560
<font color="yellow">Dad, please come to your senses.</font>

941
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,660
<font color="yellow">She looks really young.</font>

942
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,520
<font color="yellow">What would she see in you?</font>

943
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,260
<font color="yellow">It's so obvious. Can't you see that?</font>

944
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,690
<font color="yellow">You got it all wrong. You have no idea.</font>

945
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,920
<font color="yellow">She looks like someone who works at a hostess bar.</font>

946
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,460
<font color="yellow">I'm so disappointed in you. Why would you meet someone like her?</font>

947
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,190
<font color="yellow">I'm not seeing her. I made an investment.</font>

948
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,190
<font color="yellow">See this? I invested in a fried chicken business.</font>

949
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:50,890
<font color="yellow">She even made you invest money on her?</font>

950
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,790
<font color="yellow">How long have you been seeing her? How much money did she get?</font>

951
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,560
<font color="yellow">That's not it. She's Relief Patch's daughter.</font>

952
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,720
<font color="yellow">- What? - Her daughter wanted to run...</font>

953
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,360
<font color="yellow">a business, so I made a small investment.</font>

954
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,560
<font color="yellow">Si Nae! Si Nae!</font>

955
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,790
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam, I see that you are very rotten.</font>

956
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,060
<font color="yellow">What... What are you talking about?</font>

957
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,560
<font color="yellow">You came here to lure my father, didn't you?</font>

958
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,390
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

959
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:24,460
<font color="yellow">You came here pretending to take care of my father.</font>

960
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,760
<font color="yellow">But your real motive was to get money from him with your daughter.</font>

961
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,160
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

962
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,820
<font color="yellow">What do you call this situation?</font>

963
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,920
<font color="yellow">That's right. You're a gold digger.</font>

964
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,020
<font color="yellow">You've gone too far. I'm not a gold digger.</font>

965
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,190
<font color="yellow">Just because I work for you, you shouldn't say such a thing.</font>

966
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,590
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong? You and your daughter conned my father...</font>

967
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:45,390
<font color="yellow">into giving you money. You and your daughter are gold diggers.</font>

968
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,460
<font color="yellow">"Gold diggers"?</font>

969
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:50,460
<font color="yellow">Look. I can take anything from you,</font>

970
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,520
<font color="yellow">but I can't tolerate you calling my daughter a gold digger.</font>

971
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:57,460
<font color="yellow">I may be poor, but I didn't raise my daughter to be a gold digger.</font>

972
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,960
<font color="yellow">You think you can say anything you want because you're rich?</font>

973
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,420
<font color="yellow">Do you think that poor people like me don't have any self-esteem?</font>

974
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,190
<font color="yellow">It's true that you conned money from my father.</font>

975
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:08,060
<font color="yellow">We never conned anything. He made an investment.</font>

976
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,390
<font color="yellow">There is no difference.</font>

977
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,160
<font color="yellow">Let's settle this at the police station.</font>

978
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,660
<font color="yellow">I won't go to the police.</font>

979
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,590
<font color="yellow">Why won't you go? Are you afraid of your crime?</font>

980
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:19,990
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

981
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,160
<font color="yellow">Whether I committed a crime or not,</font>

982
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,590
<font color="yellow">I won't go to the police station because it may harm my son's career.</font>

983
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,120
<font color="yellow">I will pay back the money.</font>

984
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,660
<font color="yellow">You see? They approached you for your money.</font>

985
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,390
<font color="yellow">You were completely conned.</font>

986
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:36,620
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam, tell your daughter to bring the money back now.</font>

987
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,390
<font color="yellow">You've gone too far this time.</font>

988
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,990
<font color="yellow">- Leave us. - How can you let her go?</font>

989
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,860
<font color="yellow">We have to hold her until her daughter comes back with the money.</font>

990
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,360
<font color="yellow">Leave us alone.</font>

991
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,390
<font color="yellow">Don't let her go. Hey, Ms Nam.</font>

992
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,820
<font color="yellow">Dad, don't you get it?</font>

993
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,490
<font color="yellow">I will talk to you later.</font>

994
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,820
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch!</font>

995
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,990
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch!</font>

996
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:03,660
<font color="yellow">Don't be upset.</font>

997
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,220
<font color="yellow">I will take care of this. Go home for now.</font>

998
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,120
<font color="yellow">Are your feeling for me sincere?</font>

999
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,420
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

1000
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,090
<font color="yellow">Then, let's get married.</font>
