00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:11,793
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Se Gye. I didn't
know it was your house.</font>

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,163
<font color="yellow">I made you feel embarrassed
to see your in-laws.</font>

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,093
<font color="yellow">And to your wife, too.</font>

5
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:21,093
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with that.</font>

6
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,093
<font color="yellow">I just didn't know...</font>

7
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:27,003
<font color="yellow">that our housekeeper was Gab Dol's mother.</font>

8
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:29,063
<font color="yellow">It is such a complicated relationship.</font>

9
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,093
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it. You'll
only feel uncomfortable.</font>

10
00:00:32,193 --> 00:00:33,523
<font color="yellow">I won't feel uncomfortable,</font>

11
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:35,963
<font color="yellow">but I'll pretend that I don't know.</font>

12
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,293
<font color="yellow">You must feel discouraged.</font>

13
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:41,393
<font color="yellow">In fact, when I was cleaning for work...</font>

14
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:43,773
<font color="yellow">and even when I write about it on my blog,</font>

15
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:47,093
<font color="yellow">I've been afraid that someone
I know might recognise me.</font>

16
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:51,163
<font color="yellow">I've been pretending to be
confident, but that act was a lie.</font>

17
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:53,443
<font color="yellow">That was the only way for me to cope.</font>

18
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:57,123
<font color="yellow">I think I've made a breakthrough
after meeting Gab Dol's mum.</font>

19
00:00:58,193 --> 00:01:00,593
<font color="yellow">I'm confident that I won't be
embarrassed like I was before.</font>

20
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,223
<font color="yellow">I think I will be fine even if I
meet a friend while I am cleaning.</font>

21
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:07,863
<font color="yellow">Hello, customer. Where should I clean?</font>

22
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:09,663
<font color="yellow">Please tell everyone about our service.</font>

23
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:12,083

next service will be free.</font>

24
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:13,793
<font color="yellow">That's not easy to do.</font>

25
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:17,923
<font color="yellow">Koreans can't be true to themselves...</font>

26
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,783
<font color="yellow">because they're so conscious
of how others view them.</font>

27
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:23,763
<font color="yellow">I'm proud of you.</font>

28
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:26,463
<font color="yellow">I will do this.</font>

29

<font color="yellow">I must do this.</font>

30
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,993
<font color="yellow">At least, our family has you.</font>

31
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:37,063
<font color="yellow">"What's wrong with my daughters?"</font>

32
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,193
<font color="yellow">"What would I have done without Se Gye?"</font>

33
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:40,793
<font color="yellow">"Se Gye is our only hope."</font>

34
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,523
<font color="yellow">Mum always says that.</font>

35
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:46,423

36

37
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:51,993
<font color="yellow">You're the only one we can be proud of.</font>

38
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:58,193
<font color="yellow">Why did you cancel? You should
just postpone it until next year.</font>

39
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,563
<font color="yellow">No, I told him that I don't want to.</font>

40
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:03,763
<font color="yellow">He tried to talk me out of it. I felt bad.</font>

41
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:07,163
<font color="yellow">I can't say anything right now
since I'm not doing well.</font>

42
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,963
<font color="yellow">I wanted to send you off
in the best possible way.</font>

43
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:12,993
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

44
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:14,993

45
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,739
<font color="yellow">- Money?
- Perhaps, I should...</font>

46
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,463
<font color="yellow">meet him and talk to him directly.</font>

47
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:21,933
<font color="yellow">I will also apologise to him.</font>

48
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:24,993
<font color="yellow">I will do it. I heard that Mr
Geum is out of the country.</font>

49

when he comes back.</font>

51
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,463
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

52
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:40,663

56
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:49,063
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to give to you.</font>

57
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:51,293
<font color="yellow">Look. There's hardly any customer.</font>

58
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,839
<font color="yellow">Still, give me just a little bit.</font>

59
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,163
<font color="yellow">Can I have some water?</font>

60
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:56,423
<font color="yellow">Give him some water.</font>

61
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:02,263
<font color="yellow">Hello? So how much is the hospital bill?</font>

62
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:04,003
<font color="yellow">Get the surgery no matter what.</font>

63
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,393

even if I have to sell my body.</font>

we grew up so differently.</font>

152
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:46,663
<font color="yellow">Go on a trip? I have no car and no money.</font>

153
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:48,063
<font color="yellow">Take some time off?</font>

154
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,763
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for my parents,
I would starve to death.</font>

155
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,469
<font color="yellow">Don't give me advice based
on your living standards.</font>

156
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,093
<font color="yellow">I feel so inadequate.</font>

157
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,663
<font color="yellow">Do you have to do this?</font>

158
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:15,062
<font color="yellow">If you want to get married to me,
you should try to win my mum over.</font>

159
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:16,193
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

160
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:20,063
<font color="yellow">All my friends blame me.
I'm so embarrassed.</font>

161
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,043
<font color="yellow">You're only concerned about yourself.</font>

162
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:25,793
<font color="yellow">No one helps me with my life.</font>

163
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:27,563
<font color="yellow">Get married?</font>

164
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,263
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I refuse to marry you.</font>

165
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,823
<font color="yellow">Buy ramyeon and pay for the rent with this.</font>

166
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,423
<font color="yellow">I'll save money tenaciously
and buy a truck.</font>

167
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:04,693
<font color="yellow">Once I manage to find
customers, we won't starve.</font>

168
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:40,793
<font color="yellow">Do you feel better...</font>

169
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,163
<font color="yellow">now that you're out of Seoul?</font>

170
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,463
<font color="yellow">I don't necessarily feel better,</font>

171
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,263
<font color="yellow">but I do forget about it a while.</font>

172
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,893
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon,</font>

173
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:52,523
<font color="yellow">you know what?</font>

174
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,123
<font color="yellow">Wherever I go,</font>

175
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:57,893
<font color="yellow">I feel lonely.</font>

176
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,263
<font color="yellow">Do you at least keep in touch?</font>

177
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:05,063
<font color="yellow">You don't even know where he is, do you?</font>

178
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,323
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

179
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,793
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, you're home early nowadays.</font>

180
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:48,193
<font color="yellow">My work is quite smooth these days.</font>

181
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:51,093
<font color="yellow">- Mr Yeo.
- No need for a checkup.</font>

182
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:52,363
<font color="yellow">I'm all normal.</font>

183
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,093
<font color="yellow">I'll go upstairs, then.</font>

184
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,693
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, sit here for a second.</font>

185
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,223
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your sister?</font>

186
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:07,523
<font color="yellow">Right, why is Gab Soon cleaning around?</font>

187
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,893
<font color="yellow">- Cleaning?
- You didn't see her, did you?</font>

188
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:13,593
<font color="yellow">The one that was following the
cleaning ladies last time...</font>

189
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,293
<font color="yellow">is Se Gye's little sister.</font>

190
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,893
<font color="yellow">I thought she was preparing to
become a teacher. Was that a lie?</font>

191
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:21,363
<font color="yellow">I didn't lie. She studied to
become a teacher for a few years,</font>

192
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:23,923
<font color="yellow">but things didn't go smoothly, so
she's trying to start her business.</font>

193
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,093
<font color="yellow">A cleaning business?</font>

194
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,793
<font color="yellow">Stop her. Man has got to do the
right thing for his class.</font>

195
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,593
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason.</font>

196
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:32,792
<font color="yellow">She's all grown up. She won't
listen to her brother.</font>

197
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:36,169
<font color="yellow">You said she performed well in school, too.
Was that a lie, too?</font>

198
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:37,262
<font color="yellow">That's not a lie.</font>

199
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:39,262
<font color="yellow">There were a lot of awards
she earned at home.</font>

200
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,093
<font color="yellow">Everyone can win those awards.</font>

201
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:43,693
<font color="yellow">Who did she take after?</font>

202
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:45,893
<font color="yellow">Aren't you two biological siblings?</font>

203
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:47,963
<font color="yellow">You went overboard.</font>

204
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:50,463
<font color="yellow">How could there be a doctor and
a cleaner from the same family?</font>

205
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,622
<font color="yellow">Cut it.</font>

206
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,339
<font color="yellow">How others earn their living
is none of your business.</font>

207
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:55,523
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm embarrassed.</font>

208
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:57,623
<font color="yellow">When people ask what she does for a living,</font>

209
00:13:57,723 --> 00:13:59,093
<font color="yellow">should I say that she's a cleaner?</font>

210
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,962
<font color="yellow">Why would anyone ask you about her?</font>

211
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:03,063
<font color="yellow">It could happen.</font>

212
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,369
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

213
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,369
<font color="yellow">Don't judge people by their occupation.</font>

214
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:08,823
<font color="yellow">Then how could I judge people otherwise?</font>

215
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,169
<font color="yellow">Go outside and ask others.</font>

216
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:12,863
<font color="yellow">Everyone introduces himself by
his name and his occupation.</font>

217
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:16,063
<font color="yellow">Her brother is a doctor,
yet she lacks insight.</font>

218
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:19,299
<font color="yellow">Don't your parents say anything?</font>

219
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:22,163
<font color="yellow">Me being a doctor has nothing to
do with my sister being a cleaner.</font>

220
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,823
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with cleaning?</font>

221
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:26,223
<font color="yellow">Is it that great to be a doctor?</font>

222
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:27,763
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

223
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:29,263
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

224
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:33,093
<font color="yellow">Never mind. I'll go upstairs.</font>

225
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,363
<font color="yellow">Ms Yeo.</font>

226
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,393
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

227
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,423
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

228
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:55,063
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

229
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:14,893
<font color="yellow">Dad. It's an emergency. This is urgent!</font>

230
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:20,923
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

231
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:27,563
<font color="yellow">Go get him.</font>

232
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:45,593
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- It's me. Where are you?</font>

233
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,593
<font color="yellow">- I'm at the hospital.
- Hospital?</font>

234
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:51,163
<font color="yellow">I know you're not there.
Come home right now.</font>

235
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:56,763
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

236
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,393
<font color="yellow">Mum found out after she
went to the hospital.</font>

237
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:02,023
<font color="yellow">Did you really quit working?</font>

238
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:03,593
<font color="yellow">Answer.</font>

239
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:06,223
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

240
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:08,843
<font color="yellow">I submitted my letter of resignation.</font>

241
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,363
<font color="yellow">I should have told you earlier.</font>

242
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,323
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry that
you found out this way.</font>

243
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:18,863
<font color="yellow">Do you think this makes any sense?
How could you quit on your own?</font>

244
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:21,463
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Apologising isn't enough.</font>

245
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:23,743
<font color="yellow">Nobody would have found
out if it wasn't for me.</font>

246
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:26,793
<font color="yellow">Every morning, you pretended to go to work.</font>

247
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:28,693
<font color="yellow">How could you be so cunning?</font>

248
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:32,093
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to my family?</font>

249
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:34,363
<font color="yellow">Did your parents make you do that?</font>

250
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,493
<font color="yellow">My parents had nothing to do
with my decision. My parents...</font>

251
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,269
<font color="yellow">don't deserve your criticism.</font>

252
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:43,563
<font color="yellow">What? Then you should've
behaved appropriately.</font>

253
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:48,663
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

254
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:56,223
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

255
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,509
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

256
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:05,623
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

257
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,893
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

258
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:12,063
<font color="yellow">How could you make such decision
without a single discussion?</font>

259
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,763
<font color="yellow">Were you always like this?</font>

260
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:16,969
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.</font>

261
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:19,263
<font color="yellow">What did your parents say? Did they
tell you to submit your resignation?</font>

262
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,263
<font color="yellow">I haven't told them yet.</font>

263
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,323
<font color="yellow">You little brat!</font>

264
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:36,992
<font color="yellow">Get out. Get out of my sight...</font>

265
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:38,563
<font color="yellow">because seeing you makes me upset.</font>

266
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:45,493
<font color="yellow">It must be Geum Sik.</font>

267
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,822
<font color="yellow">What brings you here? Did
you come here by yourself?</font>

268
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:07,763
<font color="yellow">Yes, I came here by myself
to quibble over something.</font>

269
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:08,993
<font color="yellow">Quibble over something?</font>

270
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:15,323
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

271
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,493
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- I'm not fine.</font>

272
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:21,993
<font color="yellow">Are you aware that your son
quit working at the hospital?</font>

273
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:23,563
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

274
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:27,393
<font color="yellow">He resigned because he no
longer wants to be a doctor.</font>

275
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:29,393
<font color="yellow">He quit without a word.</font>

276
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,493
<font color="yellow">He resigned without our permission.</font>

277
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,033
<font color="yellow">Mum, Mum.</font>

278
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:38,393
<font color="yellow">There may be a misunderstanding.</font>

279
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,222
<font color="yellow">There's no way Se Gye would've done that.</font>

280
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:42,363
<font color="yellow">He just confirmed it with
me before I came here.</font>

281
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:46,193
<font color="yellow">I was so shocked that I even
went to another building.</font>

282
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,993
<font color="yellow">This is a fraud.</font>

283
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:51,899
<font color="yellow">I approved of my daughter's wedding
because your son was a doctor.</font>

284
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,463
<font color="yellow">I didn't approve of it to some jobless guy.</font>

285
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:55,863
<font color="yellow">How on earth did you raise your child?</font>

286
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,623
<font color="yellow">He must have looked down
upon his in-laws...</font>

287
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,893
<font color="yellow">to make such decision without a discussion.</font>

288
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,693
<font color="yellow">Let's nullify their marriage.</font>

289
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:05,863
<font color="yellow">Nullify?</font>

290
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,323
<font color="yellow">Take your son back.</font>

291
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,423
<font color="yellow">I'm done talking, so I'll go.</font>

292
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:17,663
<font color="yellow">Mum, Mum, hold yourself together.</font>

293
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:20,923
<font color="yellow">Call him. Call him now.</font>

294
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:30,092
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded to an
automated voice message system.</font>

295
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:31,093
<font color="yellow">- This call may be charged...
- His phone is off.</font>

296
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:32,293
<font color="yellow">Call your dad.</font>

297
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:35,893
<font color="yellow">What is he doing right now? Call him now!</font>

298
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:39,563
<font color="yellow">All my three kids are torturing me,</font>

299
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:41,533
<font color="yellow">and what is he doing now?</font>

300
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:44,723
<font color="yellow">I might die from anger.
Tell him to come now!</font>

301
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:46,593
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

302
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:49,269
<font color="yellow">What, what's the matter?</font>

303
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,123
<font color="yellow">You should come home.</font>

304
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:56,493
<font color="yellow">He's having ramyeon right now.</font>

305
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,563
<font color="yellow">How could you be eating
ramyeon at this situation?</font>

306
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:03,592
<font color="yellow">You left all your troublesome kids to me.</font>

307
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:06,223
<font color="yellow">How could you possibly
enjoy your life there?</font>

308
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,263
<font color="yellow">Why? What's the matter?</font>

309
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:13,293
<font color="yellow">Tell me what it is.</font>

310
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:15,993
<font color="yellow">Se Gye no longer wants to work as a doctor.</font>

311
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,033
<font color="yellow">He even quit working at the hospital.</font>

312
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,473
<font color="yellow">The in-laws want us to take him back
because their marriage was a fraud.</font>

313
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,363
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon brought Ddol Ee home
because she wants to get a divorce.</font>

314
00:20:26,763 --> 00:20:29,393
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon's marriage isn't going
to happen no matter what.</font>

315
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,423
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

316
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:32,993
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

317
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:39,163
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon!</font>

318
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:43,193
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon!</font>

319
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:58,593
<font color="yellow">This is wrong.</font>

320
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:00,599
<font color="yellow">My parents are expecting a lot from you.</font>

321
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,593
<font color="yellow">You can't make a decision
like this on your own.</font>

322
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:06,593
<font color="yellow">Answer your phone. Mother and
Grandfather are furious.</font>

323
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,533
<font color="yellow">Why did you make it come to this far?
It's not like you.</font>

324
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:12,263
<font color="yellow">(Voice Mail)</font>

325
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:15,663
<font color="yellow">First message.</font>

326
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:18,263
<font color="yellow">It's me. Let's meet.</font>

327
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:22,363
<font color="yellow">I won't scold you or say anything.
Let me just see you.</font>

328
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:47,653
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

329
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:50,663
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

330
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:57,123
<font color="yellow">You have nothing to say?</font>

331
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:00,493
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

332
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:09,623
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to send you money...</font>

333
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:41,693
<font color="yellow">You don't have to do this.</font>

334
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:43,923
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

335
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,823
<font color="yellow">Don't come in.</font>

336
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:04,523
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say.</font>

337
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:07,893
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

338
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:09,763
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

339
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:13,123
<font color="yellow">Saying sorry won't cut it.</font>

340
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,253
<font color="yellow">You need to settle this situation.</font>

341
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:18,963
<font color="yellow">I don't care about your
son quitting his job,</font>

342
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:21,563
<font color="yellow">but it becomes a problem because
he's married to my daughter.</font>

343
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:23,593
<font color="yellow">You understand what I mean, right?</font>

344
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:25,163
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

345
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:27,423
<font color="yellow">You must've been so shocked.</font>

346
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,093
<font color="yellow">He's my son,</font>

347
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:32,283
<font color="yellow">but I'm very disappointed in him.</font>

348
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:35,663
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened,
but I believe...</font>

349
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:38,593
<font color="yellow">he was going through a hard time.</font>

350
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,593
<font color="yellow">He couldn't talk to you about it.</font>

351
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:43,993
<font color="yellow">He was probably agonising
over it on his own.</font>

352
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,223
<font color="yellow">Quitting his job without
discussing with you was...</font>

353
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:49,593
<font color="yellow">a wrong thing to do.</font>

354
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,193
<font color="yellow">He should've at least...</font>

355
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:54,693
<font color="yellow">talked to you, if not to us.</font>

356
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:59,269
<font color="yellow">We never knew what Se Gye was thinking.</font>

357
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,839
<font color="yellow">He lied to us every morning and
said he was going to work.</font>

358
00:24:01,863 --> 00:24:04,723
<font color="yellow">This is different than handing
in a resignation letter.</font>

359
00:24:05,123 --> 00:24:07,463
<font color="yellow">How could he do that
without telling anyone?</font>

360
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:09,292
<font color="yellow">I was really shocked.</font>

361
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:11,263
<font color="yellow">How could he deceive us like that?</font>

362
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:13,763
<font color="yellow">I had a feeling he would do that.</font>

363
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:16,263
<font color="yellow">Smart people are the scarier kind.</font>

364
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:17,993
<font color="yellow">Look how he deceived us.</font>

365
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,423
<font color="yellow">You never know what he's going to do later.</font>

366
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:24,363
<font color="yellow">I raised him wrong.</font>

367
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:27,023
<font color="yellow">He's still young,</font>

368
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:29,323
<font color="yellow">so please forgive him.</font>

369
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:32,662
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to him and make him
return to the hospital...</font>

370
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:34,493
<font color="yellow">You can return the clothes you bought.</font>

371
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:36,293
<font color="yellow">Why not a person?</font>

372
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:38,443
<font color="yellow">They didn't register their marriage anyway.</font>

373
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:39,923
<font color="yellow">We can end this quietly.</font>

374
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:41,723
<font color="yellow">Didn't they...</font>

375
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:44,563
<font color="yellow">register their marriage?</font>

376
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:47,039
<font color="yellow">No, they didn't.</font>

377
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:49,493
<font color="yellow">We were going to when they have a baby.</font>

378
00:25:00,823 --> 00:25:04,393
<font color="yellow">Your call has been forwarded to...</font>

379
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:17,023
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

380
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:20,563
<font color="yellow">It's my kid's problem,</font>

381
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:23,023
<font color="yellow">so I'll take the responsibility.</font>

382
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:24,723
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

383
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:29,693
<font color="yellow">The reason you married your
daughter to my son was...</font>

384
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:31,863
<font color="yellow">because...</font>

385
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:34,193
<font color="yellow">of his job as a doctor.</font>

386
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:36,903
<font color="yellow">Now he wants to quit being a doctor.</font>

387
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:40,123
<font color="yellow">I'll leave it up to you to decide.</font>

388
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:45,193
<font color="yellow">You should go home and take this back.</font>

389
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:47,023
<font color="yellow">There's nobody who'd drink this.</font>

390
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:23,193
<font color="yellow">- What did they say?
- They probably want a divorce.</font>

391
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:25,999
<font color="yellow">He brought back the
liquor, so it's obvious.</font>

392
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,063
<font color="yellow">You know how mean they are.</font>

393
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:30,593
<font color="yellow">They must've shamed him. Poor Joong Nyeon.</font>

394
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:32,393
<font color="yellow">I told them I'd leave it up to them.</font>

395
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,223
<font color="yellow">I have no power.</font>

396
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:38,183
<font color="yellow">We sent my son off to a rich family
so we can get some benefits.</font>

397
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:41,463
<font color="yellow">We have no choice to
wait for their decision.</font>

398
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:42,663
<font color="yellow">Where is Se Gye?</font>

399
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,823
<font color="yellow">How can he take off after
doing such a thing?</font>

400
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:47,193
<font color="yellow">I don't think he can work
up the courage to show up.</font>

401
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:49,383
<font color="yellow">He's probably going
through a terrible time.</font>

402
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:51,193
<font color="yellow">You know how he is.</font>

403
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,293
<font color="yellow">He should've told us at least.</font>

404
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:56,063
<font color="yellow">Whether it's quitting the
hospital or quit being a doctor,</font>

405
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:58,823
<font color="yellow">he should've told his parents about it.</font>

406
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:02,393
<font color="yellow">He's a smart guy. Why didn't
he know what would happen?</font>

407
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,723
<font color="yellow">Did he become a doctor on his own?</font>

408
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:08,523
<font color="yellow">Doesn't he know how hard his
parents worked to support him?</font>

409
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,923
<font color="yellow">He's a really bad son.</font>

410
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,823
<font color="yellow">- You should just kill him.
- What did he say?</font>

411
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:16,963
<font color="yellow">You met him. Why didn't you beat him up?</font>

412
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:18,623
<font color="yellow">I had no energy.</font>

413
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:21,493
<font color="yellow">He'll tell us when he figures things out.</font>

414
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:24,903
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, I need to talk to you.</font>

415
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:46,323
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

416
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:50,893
<font color="yellow">I heard Geum Sik was here.
Why didn't you go?</font>

417
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:55,593
<font color="yellow">I think I need to divorce him.</font>

418
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:01,663
<font color="yellow">Did you take Ddol Ee into consideration?</font>

419
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,223
<font color="yellow">If that's what you decided,</font>

420
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:11,963
<font color="yellow">do what you want.</font>

421
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:14,823
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

422
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:18,263
<font color="yellow">You should scold her or something.</font>

423
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:20,569
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, "do what you want"?</font>

424
00:28:20,593 --> 00:28:23,523
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik came here and begged.
Why is she being so stubborn?</font>

425
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:25,793
<font color="yellow">It sounded like she misunderstood.</font>

426
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:28,963
<font color="yellow">Leave her be. It happened before.
Will you let it happen again?</font>

427
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:31,323
<font color="yellow">She blamed us for not stopping her.</font>

428
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,893
<font color="yellow">She said she married him because of us.</font>

429
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:36,523
<font color="yellow">Our children are adults now.
Just leave them be.</font>

430
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:38,623
<font color="yellow">You should live your life.</font>

431
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:39,823
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

432
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:42,723
<font color="yellow">Your family doesn't need you any more.</font>

433
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,893
<font color="yellow">Your children aren't yours.</font>

434
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:49,623
<font color="yellow">Once they turn 20, they don't
listen to their parents any more.</font>

435
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:52,563
<font color="yellow">Your 40-year-old daughter
won't listen to you.</font>

436
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,493
<font color="yellow">Your smart doctor son won't listen to you.</font>

437
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:58,399
<font color="yellow">Even that stubborn Gab Soon
doesn't listen to you.</font>

438
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:01,023
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon now lives alone
because you're bothersome.</font>

439
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:02,663
<font color="yellow">You're done now.</font>

440
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,723
<font color="yellow">- Mal Nyeon!
- You'll wake Ddol Ee.</font>

441
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:06,163
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

442
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:09,363
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof.</font>

443
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,163
<font color="yellow">The president is not in at the moment.</font>

444
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:30,763
<font color="yellow">I raised my son wrong.</font>

445
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:33,823
<font color="yellow">I'll leave it up to you to decide.</font>

446
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:40,223
<font color="yellow">He didn't do anything right.
Why doesn't he even come home?</font>

447
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:43,163
<font color="yellow">He hasn't even begged for forgiveness yet.</font>

448
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,523
<font color="yellow">His family is all in on this.
They knew about it.</font>

449
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:49,123
<font color="yellow">How couldn't they?</font>

450
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:53,323
<font color="yellow">He quit because he thought
he didn't have to work.</font>

451
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:56,363
<font color="yellow">He won't just live idly. He'll
have something else in mind.</font>

452
00:29:57,093 --> 00:29:58,323
<font color="yellow">How dare he!</font>

453
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:01,793
<font color="yellow">He's so sly.</font>

454
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:11,223
<font color="yellow">It's hot ginger tea.</font>

455
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:19,223
<font color="yellow">He must've suffered so much
to quit such a good job.</font>

456
00:30:19,723 --> 00:30:21,493
<font color="yellow">I would've wanted to quit, too.</font>

457
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:24,193
<font color="yellow">He sees patients all day in the hospital.</font>

458
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:26,193
<font color="yellow">He comes home and does
his duty as a doctor.</font>

459
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:30,093
<font color="yellow">She always says to him, "Don't
forget whose son-in-law you are."</font>

460
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:34,299
<font color="yellow">He always talks to me very politely.</font>

461
00:30:34,323 --> 00:30:36,393
<font color="yellow">He seems to be raised properly.</font>

462
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:38,963
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that's why he
became part of this family.</font>

463
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:41,663
<font color="yellow">Talk to him carefully...</font>

464
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:43,793
<font color="yellow">so that you can understand what happened.</font>

465
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:51,423

- Yes. You should be prepared.</font>

466
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:53,092
<font color="yellow">Why do you always be like this?</font>

467
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:55,693
<font color="yellow">Are you okay when he does
things without telling you?</font>

468
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:57,263
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason for that.</font>

469
00:30:57,393 --> 00:30:58,863
<font color="yellow">He's not a bad person.</font>

470
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:01,793
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Our family needs a good person...</font>

471

577

like it, so I won't say anything.</font>

579
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,043
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do from now on?</font>

580
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:35,093
<font color="yellow">You're smart. I'm sure you have a plan.</font>

581
00:40:36,493 --> 00:40:37,563
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

582
00:40:37,763 --> 00:40:39,563
<font color="yellow">You probably didn't quit
to just hang around.</font>

583
00:40:41,463 --> 00:40:42,543
<font color="yellow">I just want to hang around.</font>

584
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:44,903
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Did you say
you wanted to hang around?</font>

585
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:48,193
<font color="yellow">- Did I hear it wrong?
- No, you heard it correctly.</font>

586
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:51,003
<font color="yellow">I did say I just want to hang around.</font>

587
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:55,223
<font color="yellow">Ever since I was young,
I've never enjoyed my life.</font>

<font color="yellow">I tried my best only to study.</font>

591
00:41:04,393 --> 00:41:06,113
<font color="yellow">I had to struggle to keep up with my study,</font>

592

<font color="yellow">nor have I been on a trip with my friends.</font>

595
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:17,663

two days for my honeymoon...</font>

599
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,463

600
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:31,503
<font color="yellow">Was the honeymoon really
the only trip you went on?</font>

601
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:36,763
<font color="yellow">Change your clothes and wait
for me in front of the gate.</font>

602
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:46,793
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

603
00:41:53,123 --> 00:41:55,193
<font color="yellow">This is the wrong address.</font>

604
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,393
<font color="yellow">- Take it back.
- All right.</font>

605
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:17,393
<font color="yellow">Haven't you found him yet?</font>

606
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,123
<font color="yellow">I don't have time. Please find him quickly.</font>

607
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:38,163
<font color="yellow">You can't just hang around.</font>

608
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,323
<font color="yellow">I don't acknowledge someone
who can't earn his own bread.</font>

609
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:43,493
<font color="yellow">You must work in the morning.</font>

610
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:46,363
<font color="yellow">This is our store that is
the closest to our house.</font>

611
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:48,793
<font color="yellow">Start with cleaning,
organising the goods...</font>

612
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:50,163
<font color="yellow">and managing employees.</font>

613
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:52,469
<font color="yellow">Go to the clothing factory
to work once in a few days.</font>

614
00:42:52,493 --> 00:42:55,254
<font color="yellow">Start doing the basics including
from packaging to inventory control.</font>

615
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:58,183
<font color="yellow">After that, you may do whatever
you want in the afternoon.</font>

616
00:42:58,293 --> 00:42:59,653
<font color="yellow">Try doing that for the time being.</font>

617
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:01,393
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

618
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:04,623
<font color="yellow">But I have a favour to ask of you.</font>

619
00:43:06,763 --> 00:43:08,563
<font color="yellow">I have to give living
expenses to my parents.</font>

620
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:10,713
<font color="yellow">Make sure your work is worthy of that.</font>

621
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:12,863
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mr Yeo.</font>

622
00:43:23,493 --> 00:43:24,563
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

623
00:43:26,323 --> 00:43:27,323
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

624
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:29,693
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik has moved out.</font>

625
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:32,323
<font color="yellow">Did you know that?</font>

626
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:34,523
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

627
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:36,623
<font color="yellow">Why did you go there?</font>

628
00:43:37,393 --> 00:43:40,623
<font color="yellow">I went there to give some food to
the kids, but Gi Ja was there, too.</font>

629
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:42,593
<font color="yellow">She's so thoughtless.</font>

630
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:44,693
<font color="yellow">How could he move out without a word?</font>

631
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:47,093
<font color="yellow">She went there without knowing that.</font>

632
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,493
<font color="yellow">I think he moved out without
telling them, either.</font>

633
00:43:50,123 --> 00:43:53,063
<font color="yellow">I guess something bad happened to Geum Sik.</font>

634
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:55,693
<font color="yellow">He even had an accident already.</font>

635
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:57,963
<font color="yellow">He's getting so unlucky.</font>

636
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:00,163
<font color="yellow">I should've been the one who got hurt.</font>

637
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:03,393
<font color="yellow">Since I'm useless, I should've got hurt.</font>

638
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,123
<font color="yellow">For my kids,</font>

639
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:08,523
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik has to live long.</font>

640
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:10,293
<font color="yellow">Did you finally grow up?</font>

641
00:44:12,093 --> 00:44:15,893
<font color="yellow">Anyway, where did he go
with the young girls?</font>

642
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:17,493
<font color="yellow">I can't reach him.</font>

643
00:44:19,763 --> 00:44:21,593
<font color="yellow">He may have his reasons.</font>

644
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,493
<font color="yellow">What kind of reasons?</font>

645
00:44:24,023 --> 00:44:26,423
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell what it means
that he suddenly moved out?</font>

646
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,093
<font color="yellow">It's either he wanted to leave her...</font>

647
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:30,993
<font color="yellow">or he went bankrupt.</font>

648
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:33,963
<font color="yellow">I get scared when you say something.</font>

649
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:37,093
<font color="yellow">Things pan out exactly as you say.</font>

650
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:38,793
<font color="yellow">You may become a shaman at this rate.</font>

651
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,723
<font color="yellow">Why don't you meet with him?</font>

652
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:44,963
<font color="yellow">We should at least know what happened.</font>

653
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:54,793
<font color="yellow">Please don't meet him. You don't have to.</font>

654
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:58,823
<font color="yellow">He seems to have moved
out to break up with me.</font>

655
00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:00,923
<font color="yellow">So we don't need to meet him.</font>

656
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:15,293
<font color="yellow">Is there anything wrong?</font>

657
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,063
<font color="yellow">If you can't take care of our kids,</font>

658
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,763
<font color="yellow">bring them to me.</font>

659
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:32,263
<font color="yellow">I'm frustrated.</font>

660
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:35,133
<font color="yellow">I can't take a shower because
the bathroom is too small.</font>

661
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,363
<font color="yellow">You should've at least order Chinese food.</font>

662
00:45:39,563 --> 00:45:41,293
<font color="yellow">You should know better.</font>

663
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,163
<font color="yellow">We should save even a penny.</font>

664
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:46,423
<font color="yellow">This is for you. I poured water for you.</font>

665
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:51,693
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik, did we have to
move into a place like this?</font>

666
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:53,993
<font color="yellow">Please be quiet, Aunt.</font>

667
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:56,463
<font color="yellow">I don't like this place, either.</font>

668
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:58,493
<font color="yellow">I want to go home.</font>

669
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:02,723
<font color="yellow">We have no other choice.</font>

670
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:05,993
<font color="yellow">I used up all our money
to save the company.</font>

671
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,363
<font color="yellow">Please endure even if it's uncomfortable.</font>

672
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:09,833
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best to earn again.</font>

673
00:46:10,963 --> 00:46:11,963
<font color="yellow">A Young,</font>

674
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:13,993
<font color="yellow">take care of my kids for the time being.</font>

675
00:46:14,263 --> 00:46:15,839
<font color="yellow">I have a packed schedule for my flight.</font>

676
00:46:15,863 --> 00:46:17,623
<font color="yellow">I should have a secure job at least.</font>

677
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:19,523
<font color="yellow">Dad, don't worry and just work.</font>

678
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:21,063
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Da Rong.</font>

679
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:24,122
<font color="yellow">Even when she was young, I changed
her diapers and fed her formula.</font>

680
00:46:24,123 --> 00:46:25,523
<font color="yellow">I technically raised her.</font>

681
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:27,863
<font color="yellow">It's much easier now
since she grew up a lot.</font>

682
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:30,193
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, you're cheering me up.</font>

683
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,063
<font color="yellow">- What about the money?
- What?</font>

684
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:37,123
<font color="yellow">That money will be a big relief to us now.</font>

685
00:46:37,293 --> 00:46:39,693
<font color="yellow">Stop pestering me. Do you think
I'll not get it back to you?</font>

686
00:46:42,263 --> 00:46:44,063
<font color="yellow">- Aunt, eat ramyeon.
- I won't eat it.</font>

687
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:47,763
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat.</font>

688
00:46:51,163 --> 00:46:53,023
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Cho Rong.</font>

689
00:46:53,493 --> 00:46:56,223
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself and
don't worry about us.</font>

690
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,563
<font color="yellow">I appreciate it.</font>

691
00:46:58,093 --> 00:46:59,823
<font color="yellow">- Go, Dad.
- Go.</font>

692
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:10,323
<font color="yellow">This is our main item made
with ostrich leather.</font>

693
00:47:11,023 --> 00:47:12,423
<font color="yellow">The customer response is very good.</font>

694
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,093
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

695
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:22,423
<font color="yellow">We're home.</font>

696
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:24,723
<font color="yellow">Father, let's talk.</font>

697
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:34,793
<font color="yellow">- Do you have something to say?
- Where have you been?</font>

698
00:47:35,393 --> 00:47:36,623
<font color="yellow">Why are you curious?</font>

699
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:38,663
<font color="yellow">I've been to the shops and...</font>

700
00:47:39,363 --> 00:47:40,993
<font color="yellow">the factory with Se Gye.</font>

701
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:45,623
<font color="yellow">You're not handing over our
company to him, are you?</font>

702
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:47,293
<font color="yellow">He made the cut.</font>

703
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:50,393
<font color="yellow">I'm 70 years old. I need
to decide the heir now.</font>

704
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:51,593
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

705
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:53,693
<font color="yellow">I've worked so hard under
your supervision...</font>

706
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:56,063
<font color="yellow">for more than 20 years so far.</font>

707
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:58,943
<font color="yellow">Though I didn't study much, I did
most of the work for the company.</font>

708
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:02,493
<font color="yellow">I know the best about the company.
I can't give it up.</font>

709
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,593
<font color="yellow">I tried hard to build my assets.</font>

710
00:48:05,493 --> 00:48:07,069
<font color="yellow">A smart person should take care of them.</font>

711
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,223
<font color="yellow">I know much better about
how hard you tried.</font>

712
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:10,993
<font color="yellow">You can't do as you like.</font>

713
00:48:33,423 --> 00:48:34,563
<font color="yellow">You're mean.</font>

714
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:36,373
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

715
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,393
<font color="yellow">I was on your side so far,</font>

716
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,363
<font color="yellow">but I can't be in this matter.</font>

717
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:42,593
<font color="yellow">You're wrong this time.</font>

718
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:45,593
<font color="yellow">You should know better.
I'm doing this for you...</font>

719
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:47,293
<font color="yellow">so that you won't be left out.</font>

720
00:48:47,393 --> 00:48:49,593
<font color="yellow">In order to hand it over to you,
I need to take it over first.</font>

721
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:52,263
<font color="yellow">If Se Gye starts to run this
company as your grandpa says,</font>

722
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:53,623
<font color="yellow">you can't take the money.</font>

723
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:55,793
<font color="yellow">You already know about the
financial situation of his family.</font>

724
00:48:56,363 --> 00:48:59,363
<font color="yellow">Both of his sisters are not doing well.</font>

725
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:02,163
<font color="yellow">The whole family will rush
in to take the money.</font>

726
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,993
<font color="yellow">You're taking his side
since he's your husband,</font>

727
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:09,063
<font color="yellow">but we can only rely on each other.</font>

728
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,723
<font color="yellow">We have to count on each other.</font>

729
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:21,263
<font color="yellow">How much do you think
you can make with this?</font>

730
00:49:21,823 --> 00:49:24,123
<font color="yellow">If my eyesight were good, I
could string them quickly.</font>

731
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:28,663
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

732
00:49:29,793 --> 00:49:31,563
<font color="yellow">It can ruin your eyes.</font>

733
00:49:32,463 --> 00:49:33,492
<font color="yellow">Drop it.</font>

734
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:35,253
<font color="yellow">My son is delivering
water during the day...</font>

735
00:49:35,363 --> 00:49:37,693
<font color="yellow">and alcohol at night.</font>

736
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:39,563
<font color="yellow">I have to earn even a little for him.</font>

737
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:42,903
<font color="yellow">Are you quitting this for good?</font>

738
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:44,623
<font color="yellow">Did you find a sponsor or something?</font>

739
00:49:44,793 --> 00:49:46,823
<font color="yellow">The sponsor of my life is me.</font>

740
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:48,593
<font color="yellow">I want to change my field.</font>

741
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:51,069
<font color="yellow">From entertainment to labour.</font>

742
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:54,193
<font color="yellow">Are you going to do labour? I bet
you won't even last a month.</font>

743
00:49:54,893 --> 00:49:56,393
<font color="yellow">Just wait and see if I'll survive.</font>

744
00:49:58,493 --> 00:50:00,533
<font color="yellow">You told me about a chicken
restaurant a while ago.</font>

745
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:03,523
<font color="yellow">You said your acquaintance
wants to sell it fast.</font>

746
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,123
<font color="yellow">- Did he sell it?
- I'll call him.</font>

747
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,393
<font color="yellow">The food is ready. Please enjoy it.</font>

748
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:11,593
<font color="yellow">Hi. You're here.</font>

749
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:13,923
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

750
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:23,923
<font color="yellow">You're not cut out for business.</font>

751
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,193
<font color="yellow">I visited there, and it was so crowded.</font>

752
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:29,523
<font color="yellow">Why would they sell a popular restaurant?</font>

753
00:50:29,623 --> 00:50:32,793
<font color="yellow">They have to go to the Philippines
to take care of their kids.</font>

754
00:50:33,293 --> 00:50:36,093
<font color="yellow">The decoration is nice, and I think
I could make quite a lot of money.</font>

755
00:50:36,223 --> 00:50:37,223
<font color="yellow">Mum,</font>

756
00:50:37,823 --> 00:50:38,923
<font color="yellow">can I please run that restaurant?</font>

757
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:40,363
<font color="yellow">Do it if you have the money.</font>

758
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,569
<font color="yellow">I want you to open it for me.</font>

759
00:50:42,593 --> 00:50:45,693
<font color="yellow">I don't have any money. Besides,
not everyone can do business.</font>

760
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:48,663
<font color="yellow">You have to sacrifice
everything to run a business.</font>

761
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:51,093
<font color="yellow">You can't do it because you
have a horrible personality.</font>

762
00:50:51,193 --> 00:50:52,893
<font color="yellow">You'll even drive your own customers away.</font>

763
00:50:53,423 --> 00:50:57,063
<font color="yellow">- I can do it.
- You'll go bankrupt in three days.</font>

764
00:50:57,423 --> 00:51:00,423
<font color="yellow">You said you're too weak to work.
How will you run your business?</font>

765
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:02,563
<font color="yellow">If you won't help me, forget it.</font>

766
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:04,822
<font color="yellow">I'll start it no matter what.</font>

767
00:51:04,823 --> 00:51:07,623
<font color="yellow">I know you're penniless. Why the big talk?</font>

768
00:51:07,723 --> 00:51:10,463
<font color="yellow">Besides, stop asking me for
money because I'm broke.</font>

769
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:12,963
<font color="yellow">I know you have money.</font>

770
00:51:13,293 --> 00:51:14,923
<font color="yellow">I don't have it!</font>

771
00:51:16,363 --> 00:51:17,623
<font color="yellow">I know you hid money somewhere.</font>

772
00:51:18,393 --> 00:51:21,323
<font color="yellow">Even if everyone is broke, you'll never be.</font>

773
00:51:21,493 --> 00:51:23,263
<font color="yellow">You're so fierce.</font>

774
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:25,322
<font color="yellow">I know you won't even share a penny.</font>

775
00:51:25,323 --> 00:51:26,569
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're aware of that.</font>

776
00:51:26,593 --> 00:51:28,763
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your life alone.</font>

777
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:34,123
<font color="yellow">You think your business will
flourish once the store is open,</font>

778
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:35,863
<font color="yellow">but that's just your dream.</font>

779
00:51:36,323 --> 00:51:39,723
<font color="yellow">You can't even pour a cup
of water for yourself.</font>

780
00:51:40,023 --> 00:51:42,723
<font color="yellow">You'll only run into a
fight with your customer.</font>

781
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:45,303
<font color="yellow">I'll be relieved if you don't
get locked up behind bars.</font>

782
00:51:45,893 --> 00:51:47,923
<font color="yellow">Stop cursing me!</font>

783
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,523
<font color="yellow">What if I do well?</font>

784
00:51:54,723 --> 00:51:55,793
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

785
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,193
<font color="yellow">I'm looking at today's sales report.</font>

786
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,062
<font color="yellow">I'm also checking popular products.</font>

787
00:52:00,063 --> 00:52:02,993
<font color="yellow">Stop caring about such things
and clean up the boxes outside.</font>

788
00:52:04,793 --> 00:52:06,192
<font color="yellow">I already did.</font>

789
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:08,063
<font color="yellow">Arrange the inventory, then.</font>

790
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:11,623
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

791
00:52:24,963 --> 00:52:25,993
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

792
00:52:30,623 --> 00:52:31,693
<font color="yellow">Do you deliver water?</font>

793
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:33,669
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

794
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,463
<font color="yellow">Will you deliver it to my office as well?</font>

795
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:41,963
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

796
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:44,323
<font color="yellow">Please find him as soon as you can.</font>

797
00:52:44,493 --> 00:52:46,363
<font color="yellow">I said I'm willing to pay
as much as it takes.</font>

798
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:48,493
<font color="yellow">Do it as soon as you can.</font>

799
00:53:55,563 --> 00:53:57,823
<font color="yellow">You answered right away.
What are you doing?</font>

800
00:53:57,993 --> 00:53:59,123
<font color="yellow">I'm just hanging around.</font>

801
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:01,693
<font color="yellow">I was worried about what I'd do,</font>

802
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:03,793
<font color="yellow">but time passes so quickly.</font>

803
00:54:05,293 --> 00:54:06,363
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

804
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:10,123
<font color="yellow">If you're happy, I'm happy, too.</font>

805
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:12,423
<font color="yellow">Don't you miss me?</font>

806
00:54:13,823 --> 00:54:16,363
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I should've
mentioned that first.</font>

807
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:18,463
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your freedom while you can.</font>

808
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:36,183
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me that you
hadn't registered your marriage?</font>

809
00:54:37,493 --> 00:54:38,623
<font color="yellow">I had already guessed,</font>

810
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:41,963
<font color="yellow">but I learned how your in-laws
treat you after this incident.</font>

811
00:54:44,893 --> 00:54:48,093
<font color="yellow">I thought all my kids' matters
were resolved, but I was wrong.</font>

812
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:50,023
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

813
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:54,423
<font color="yellow">I was at least going to tell you,</font>

814
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:56,523
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't do it.</font>

815
00:54:57,263 --> 00:54:59,793
<font color="yellow">Since you already fell on the ground,</font>

816
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:01,893
<font color="yellow">take a bit of rest and think.</font>

817
00:55:06,163 --> 00:55:07,523
<font color="yellow">Your aunt gave me this.</font>

818
00:55:07,793 --> 00:55:11,363
<font color="yellow">She got her living expenses
before all this happened.</font>

819
00:55:11,823 --> 00:55:13,183
<font color="yellow">She gave it to me in astonishment.</font>

820
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:14,423
<font color="yellow">Give it back to her.</font>

821
00:55:14,723 --> 00:55:19,223
<font color="yellow">No, I'll still take care
of the living expenses.</font>

822
00:55:19,323 --> 00:55:20,323
<font color="yellow">Take it.</font>

823
00:55:20,623 --> 00:55:22,823
<font color="yellow">I told you there's no need
for the living expenses.</font>

824
00:55:23,963 --> 00:55:26,393
<font color="yellow">- Don't do this.
- Take it now.</font>

825
00:55:35,823 --> 00:55:37,023
<font color="yellow">Do you feel better now?</font>

826
00:55:38,823 --> 00:55:41,223
<font color="yellow">It breaks my heart that you suffered...</font>

827
00:55:41,663 --> 00:55:43,023
<font color="yellow">every time you went inside the OR.</font>

828
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:46,993
<font color="yellow">I had no idea that you didn't
want to work as a doctor.</font>

829
00:55:47,963 --> 00:55:51,263
<font color="yellow">People have lingering feelings for
what they could not accomplish.</font>

830
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,093
<font color="yellow">Since you only thought about
pursuing one career path,</font>

831
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,293
<font color="yellow">look around for other options...</font>

832
00:55:58,263 --> 00:55:59,383
<font color="yellow">so that you won't regret it.</font>

833
00:56:00,593 --> 00:56:02,323
<font color="yellow">Do it while you're still young.</font>

834
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:06,963
<font color="yellow">If I could live my life again, I
would've made the same decision.</font>

835
00:56:08,363 --> 00:56:12,363
<font color="yellow">I would've done everything I wanted to do.</font>

836
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:25,673
<font color="yellow">Did your mother-in-law
want to give this to me?</font>

837
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:28,522
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

838
00:56:28,523 --> 00:56:30,593
<font color="yellow">It feels like I earned
this by selling my son.</font>

839
00:56:31,363 --> 00:56:34,163
<font color="yellow">I didn't realise it when you were a
doctor, but now it feels like it.</font>

840
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:35,923
<font color="yellow">Don't think like that.</font>

841
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:38,793
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'll give
you the money myself.</font>

842
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,093
<font color="yellow">No matter what I do,</font>

843
00:56:41,263 --> 00:56:44,123
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of your living
expenses, so don't worry.</font>

844
00:56:44,893 --> 00:56:47,563
<font color="yellow">This is what sons do.</font>

<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

846
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:55,323
<font color="yellow">Can't you work as a doctor again?</font>

847
00:56:55,963 --> 00:56:58,793
<font color="yellow">People struggle so much
to become one, but you...</font>

848
00:56:59,993 --> 00:57:02,493
<font color="yellow">Take a break for a few days,
and go back to the hospital.</font>

849
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:05,423
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to work for
that hospital, find another one.</font>

850
00:57:06,163 --> 00:57:08,763
<font color="yellow">Your dad didn't want me to say anything,</font>

851
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,993
<font color="yellow">and I wasn't planning to say anything,</font>

852
00:57:11,693 --> 00:57:13,323
<font color="yellow">but I end up saying this...</font>

853
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,263
<font color="yellow">because I feel so bad for you.</font>

854
00:57:15,823 --> 00:57:17,863
<font color="yellow">You struggled so much to
earn your medical licence.</font>

855
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:28,493
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't treat
you to a better place.</font>

856
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:29,763
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

857
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:33,623
<font color="yellow">I'm old-fashioned, so I
like places like here.</font>

858
00:57:34,093 --> 00:57:36,822
<font color="yellow">My favourite food is a home-cooked meal.</font>

859
00:57:36,823 --> 00:57:37,823
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it is.</font>

860
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,962
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry my son...</font>

861
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:45,263
<font color="yellow">upset you.</font>

862
00:57:46,893 --> 00:57:49,263
<font color="yellow">Besides, thank you...</font>

863
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:51,923
<font color="yellow">for accepting him nonetheless
with a broad mind.</font>

864
00:57:53,293 --> 00:57:56,622
<font color="yellow">I'll have to wait and see,
but Se Gye is a smart guy,</font>

865
00:57:56,623 --> 00:57:58,463
<font color="yellow">so he will be good at anything.</font>

866
00:57:58,593 --> 00:58:01,063
<font color="yellow">Se Gye is now a member of my family.</font>

867
00:58:02,293 --> 00:58:03,293
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

868
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:07,993
<font color="yellow">There's no man in my family,
so he has to be the son.</font>

869
00:58:08,663 --> 00:58:11,123
<font color="yellow">You have daughters...</font>

870
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:13,863
<font color="yellow">and a son-in-law as well.</font>

871

872
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:26,893
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

873

<font color="yellow">I'm checking my blog.</font>

874

<font color="yellow">At least, you should be
the son of our family!</font>

880
00:58:42,593 --> 00:58:43,963
<font color="yellow">You need to bring a smart son-in-law...</font>

my son is still young.</font>

<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

889
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:36,463
<font color="yellow">Yes. You expanded the company,</font>

890
00:59:36,793 --> 00:59:39,123
<font color="yellow">so you should run the company.</font>

891
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:40,923
<font color="yellow">I'm not in the right position to do so,</font>

892
00:59:41,463 --> 00:59:43,193
<font color="yellow">and I feel too bad to do that.</font>

893
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:45,863
<font color="yellow">I'm reflecting on it as well.</font>

894
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:49,823
<font color="yellow">I tried to expand it recklessly,
and that was the problem.</font>

<font color="yellow">The company lost nothing from it.</font>

896
00:59:52,363 --> 00:59:55,393
<font color="yellow">You saved the company from going
bankrupt with your own assets,</font>

897
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:57,923
<font color="yellow">so us, the shareholders, lost nothing.</font>

expanded the company this big.</font>

899
01:00:02,493 --> 01:00:05,523
<font color="yellow">You need to recover from
your loss last time.</font>

900
01:00:05,723 --> 01:00:06,963
<font color="yellow">If that's really what you want,</font>

901
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:09,793
<font color="yellow">I'll start over from the sales position.</font>

902
01:00:10,763 --> 01:00:13,293
<font color="yellow">I'll start over from the bottom.</font>

903
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:17,223
<font color="yellow">Let's decide over a general
shareholders' meeting.</font>

904
01:00:31,723 --> 01:00:32,763
<font color="yellow">Long time no see.</font>

905
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,103
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving for a delivery?</font>

906
01:00:37,393 --> 01:00:38,873
<font color="yellow">Let's be comfortable with each other.</font>

907
01:00:39,363 --> 01:00:41,363
<font color="yellow">You make me feel awkward.</font>

908
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,493
<font color="yellow">- Can we move out?
- No way.</font>

909
01:00:51,863 --> 01:00:53,363
<font color="yellow">There isn't any place like this...</font>

910
01:00:53,493 --> 01:00:55,923
<font color="yellow">that's so cheap and offers
some food sometimes.</font>

911
01:00:56,493 --> 01:00:59,023
<font color="yellow">Let's move to a nice place after saving up.</font>

912
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:01,093
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking all of a sudden?</font>

913
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:03,523
<font color="yellow">Never mind. See you later.</font>

914
01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:05,323
<font color="yellow">Don't work too hard.</font>

915
01:01:05,593 --> 01:01:08,493
<font color="yellow">If you get hurt, it'll cost
more than you earn. Got it?</font>

916
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:19,063
<font color="yellow">That darn money!</font>

917
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:22,223
<font color="yellow">Who on earth owns all the money?</font>

918
01:01:22,523 --> 01:01:23,793
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's crazy.</font>

919
01:01:36,763 --> 01:01:38,493
<font color="yellow">I heard you had an accident.</font>

920
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:40,863
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling all right?</font>

921
01:01:41,463 --> 01:01:44,263
<font color="yellow">The bone was fractured, so
it'll be okay as time goes by.</font>

922
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:46,823
<font color="yellow">I'll take off the cast next week.</font>

923
01:01:47,363 --> 01:01:48,763
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness you're okay.</font>

924
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:52,123
<font color="yellow">I heard you moved out. Where is it?</font>

925
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:55,293
<font color="yellow">It's around the old place
because of my kids' school.</font>

926
01:01:56,763 --> 01:01:58,223
<font color="yellow">It's smaller than before, though.</font>

927
01:01:58,563 --> 01:02:00,393
<font color="yellow">Are you not doing well at all?</font>

928
01:02:01,123 --> 01:02:02,963
<font color="yellow">I had to use all my money...</font>

929
01:02:03,863 --> 01:02:05,063
<font color="yellow">and barely took care of it.</font>

930
01:02:06,463 --> 01:02:09,793
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to damage the
company I've been all in.</font>

931
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,863
<font color="yellow">So did you quit?</font>

932
01:02:13,123 --> 01:02:14,723
<font color="yellow">I work as a sales manager.</font>

933
01:02:15,623 --> 01:02:17,293
<font color="yellow">I'll start over from scratch.</font>

934
01:02:18,323 --> 01:02:21,593
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you...</font>

935
01:02:22,223 --> 01:02:23,763
<font color="yellow">to talk about my current situation.</font>

936
01:02:24,863 --> 01:02:26,463
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon didn't want to see me.</font>

937
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:29,163
<font color="yellow">Actually, I'm in trouble.</font>

938
01:02:30,993 --> 01:02:33,893
<font color="yellow">I had to use all my savings
and sell the house.</font>

939
01:02:36,763 --> 01:02:38,093
<font color="yellow">I'm like this now,</font>

940
01:02:39,563 --> 01:02:42,323
<font color="yellow">so I can't even ask Jae Soon to come back.</font>

941
01:02:47,623 --> 01:02:49,863
<font color="yellow">If you had a child with him,</font>

942
01:02:50,363 --> 01:02:52,393
<font color="yellow">I would say you have to
support him by his side.</font>

943
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:54,893
<font color="yellow">But since you decided to get a divorce,</font>

944
01:02:55,463 --> 01:02:56,993
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you to stay with him...</font>

945
01:02:57,793 --> 01:02:59,223
<font color="yellow">nor break up.</font>

946
01:02:59,963 --> 01:03:01,669
<font color="yellow">She can't go back because she came here...</font>

947
01:03:01,693 --> 01:03:03,663
<font color="yellow">before bad things happened.</font>

948
01:03:04,563 --> 01:03:06,493
<font color="yellow">No one will blame Jae Soon anyway.</font>

949
01:03:06,923 --> 01:03:10,193
<font color="yellow">I guess that's all the
luck Jae Soon's got...</font>

950
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:13,069
<font color="yellow">since whoever she marries
would become broke.</font>

951
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:14,163
<font color="yellow">- Mal Nyeon!
- Mal Nyeon!</font>

952
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:19,923
<font color="yellow">So do you live like that because
you only had that much luck?</font>

953
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,823
<font color="yellow">Tell her to watch out her mouth already!</font>

954
01:03:22,923 --> 01:03:24,523
<font color="yellow">Before you talk,</font>

955
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:27,193
<font color="yellow">just think it over at least once.</font>

956
01:03:27,823 --> 01:03:31,063
<font color="yellow">How could you spit it out
like a high-speed train?</font>

957
01:03:31,163 --> 01:03:33,993
<font color="yellow">Her words are even faster
than a high-speed train.</font>

958
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:36,263
<font color="yellow">What's in your mind?</font>

959
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:40,193
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't go back.</font>

960
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:42,063
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you.</font>

961
01:03:44,293 --> 01:03:45,393
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

962
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:48,993
<font color="yellow">I'll get a divorce.</font>

963
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:58,593
<font color="yellow">(Seoul Prison)</font>

964
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,293
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Dad?</font>

965
01:04:51,023 --> 01:04:52,263
<font color="yellow">Nothing. Just go back to sleep.</font>

966
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:00,093
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

967
01:05:01,393 --> 01:05:03,823
<font color="yellow">Why did you come out? Sleep more.</font>

968
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:09,123
<font color="yellow">Dad, don't cry.</font>

969
01:05:09,763 --> 01:05:12,993
<font color="yellow">I'm not crying. Why would I cry?</font>

970
01:05:14,093 --> 01:05:15,163
<font color="yellow">I'm not crying.</font>

971
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:18,493
<font color="yellow">I'm not crying.</font>

972
01:05:20,923 --> 01:05:22,023
<font color="yellow">I'm not crying.</font>
