1
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:07,182
<font color="yellow">About the allowance...</font>

2
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:10,282
<font color="yellow">We won't be able to give it to you for a while, but don't be upset.</font>

3
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:11,882
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother.</font>

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:14,352
<font color="yellow">Once I make a lot of money, I'll give you a lot.</font>

5
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:17,122
<font color="yellow">Did you two decide what to say beforehand?</font>

6
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:19,852
<font color="yellow">Yes. What? No.</font>

7
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:22,382
<font color="yellow">We should give her allowance.</font>

8
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:24,252
<font color="yellow">You told me to take care of it.</font>

9
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,052
<font color="yellow">We can't afford to give her allowance.</font>

10
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:29,182
<font color="yellow">We should save up quickly to buy a house.</font>

11
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:33,682
<font color="yellow">- Also, Mother... - What now?</font>

12
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:36,792
<font color="yellow">All right. You've already started, so keep going. What else?</font>

13
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:39,082
<font color="yellow">Please give me my husband's passbook.</font>

14
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,152
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

15
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:44,282
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of my husband's passbook from now on.</font>

16
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:47,322
<font color="yellow">You'll only pay me 600 dollars...</font>

17
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:50,282
<font color="yellow">without any allowance, and you'll make me do all the household work.</font>

18
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:52,582
<font color="yellow">And now, you're asking me to give you my son's passbook?</font>

19
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:56,282
<font color="yellow">I guess you take me for a complete fool.</font>

20
00:00:58,682 --> 00:00:59,822
<font color="yellow">I'm not eating.</font>

21
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:19,822
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

22
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:38,522
<font color="yellow">Here it is. Live a happy life with this.</font>

23
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:40,382
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mother.</font>

24
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:44,822
<font color="yellow">Must you check it right now?</font>

25
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:46,822
<font color="yellow">I should know how much there is.</font>

26
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:50,482
<font color="yellow">You gave me the wrong passbook, Mother.</font>

27
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:51,982
<font color="yellow">This one is for a house application.</font>

28
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,752
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

29
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,122
<font color="yellow">I told you that my mum is sensitive about money.</font>

30
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:01,922
<font color="yellow">Did you have to bring it up during breakfast?</font>

31
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,552
<font color="yellow">Everyone is sensitive about money.</font>

32
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:06,382
<font color="yellow">She would've gotten upset even if I talked about this during dinner.</font>

33
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:08,052
<font color="yellow">It's something I had to say anyway.</font>

34
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,422
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

35
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,722
<font color="yellow">It's harder to find now that I'm in a rush.</font>

36
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,652
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

37
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:23,182
<font color="yellow">Were you afraid that I might take my son's money?</font>

38
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:25,392
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll steal from my own son?</font>

39
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,552
<font color="yellow">I was going to give it to you when the time is right.</font>

40
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:29,892
<font color="yellow">I made a savings account and an account for a house application.</font>

41
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,652
<font color="yellow">I even joined a private fund to increase his money.</font>

42
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,552
<font color="yellow">What kind of a daughter-in-law...</font>

43
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,222
<font color="yellow">asks for a passbook on the first day of her marriage?</font>

44
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:41,282
<font color="yellow">From now, you two lead a happy life of your own.</font>

45
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:45,352
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

46
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,752
<font color="yellow">Mother, thank you.</font>

47
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:04,682
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to ask for the passbook so early in the morning?</font>

48
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,882
<font color="yellow">It's been less than 24 hours since we got married.</font>

49
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:09,222
<font color="yellow">She'll do a good job in taking care of my money.</font>

50
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,552
<font color="yellow">She's not someone who'll steal from me.</font>

51
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,152
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying I am?</font>

52
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:16,152
<font color="yellow">She rarely throws away food because she thinks it's a waste.</font>

53
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,822
<font color="yellow">I'm getting really anxious already.</font>

54
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:23,382
<font color="yellow">You said you could deal with my mum. But look what's going on already.</font>

55
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:26,282
<font color="yellow">I need to say what I must. Do you want me to bring it up later?</font>

56
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:28,252
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you to go easy on her.</font>

57
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:30,482
<font color="yellow">She's been through a lot all her life.</font>

58
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:34,322
<font color="yellow">Honey, I've heard enough. So please go to work.</font>

59
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:38,152
<font color="yellow">Please do a good job so I don't have to worry, Honey.</font>

60
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,752
<font color="yellow">Mother, I washed all the dishes.</font>

61
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:48,152
<font color="yellow">I put the laundry in the washer. So before you go out to work,</font>

62
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:50,122
<font color="yellow">please shake them off and hang them.</font>

63
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:53,182
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me what to do?</font>

64
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,752
<font color="yellow">I'm just doing exactly what you taught me.</font>

65
00:03:57,252 --> 00:04:00,422
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to do the dishes since I have to leave early.</font>

66
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,852
<font color="yellow">If it is too hard to do the dishes, just leave them in the sink.</font>

67
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:04,782
<font color="yellow">I'll do it when I come home late at night.</font>

68
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:06,852
<font color="yellow">I can cut my sleeping time to do that.</font>

69
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,022
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll be off to earn money now.</font>

70
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:13,322
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

71
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:19,652
<font color="yellow">Just one more bite.</font>

72
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:22,822
<font color="yellow">I don't want to eat it.</font>

73
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:29,782
<font color="yellow">If you eat this, I'll buy anything you want.</font>

74
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:32,652
<font color="yellow">- I want a robot. - Okay. I'll buy you a robot.</font>

75
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,822
<font color="yellow">Good job, my son.</font>

76
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,692
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin.</font>

77
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,652
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - We came to see Ddol Ee.</font>

78
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:51,522
<font color="yellow">How is Ddol Ee doing?</font>

79
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:54,352
<font color="yellow">- He doing much better. - That's a relief.</font>

80
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,482
<font color="yellow">Can we see Ddol Ee?</font>

81
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,652
<font color="yellow">Go back. You can't meet Ddol Ee now.</font>

82
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:04,922
<font color="yellow">Then please give this to him.</font>

83
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:06,552
<font color="yellow">I made this card for him.</font>

84
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,452
<font color="yellow">Please give him this chocolate, too.</font>

85
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:11,952
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

86
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:14,522
<font color="yellow">Go home now.</font>

87
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,022
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

88
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:22,882
<font color="yellow">Are they who I think they are? Why did they come here?</font>

89
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:24,582
<font color="yellow">They must've come because they were worried about Ddol Ee.</font>

90
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:27,752
<font color="yellow">They obviously came here because you called them over.</font>

91
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:29,622
<font color="yellow">I don't like them, either.</font>

92
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,452
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that. They're still young kids.</font>

93
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:33,982
<font color="yellow">Young kids?</font>

94
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,822
<font color="yellow">Did you forget how they treated Ddol Ee?</font>

95
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:40,152
<font color="yellow">They were mean to Ddol Ee along with their Dad.</font>

96
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:41,922
<font color="yellow">That's why he had to undergo psychotherapy.</font>

97
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:43,322
<font color="yellow">That's all in the past.</font>

98
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:45,082
<font color="yellow">Don't raise your voice at the hospital.</font>

99
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:51,182
<font color="yellow">Just wait until Ddol Ee gets discharged from the hospital.</font>

100
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:56,122
<font color="yellow">- You went to the hospital? - Yes.</font>

101
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,782
<font color="yellow">Did you get to see Ddol Ee? How is he doing?</font>

102
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:01,982
<font color="yellow">We didn't get to see him. Ms Shin told us to leave.</font>

103
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:03,682
<font color="yellow">It seemed like she was afraid of him.</font>

104
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:04,952
<font color="yellow">"Him"?</font>

105
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:07,082
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee's dad?</font>

106
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:11,022
<font color="yellow">He's scary. He kept staring at us.</font>

107
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:12,382
<font color="yellow">Don't ever go there again.</font>

108
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,922
<font color="yellow">Dad, are things over with Ms Shin?</font>

109
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:25,852
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my meat?</font>

110
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,022
<font color="yellow">- It's perfect for romance - What are you doing?</font>

111
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,822
<font color="yellow">I'm going to cook some meat for Soo Jo.</font>

112
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:35,282
<font color="yellow">He works so hard everyday, so I should cook some meat for him.</font>

113
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:38,182
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo really loves meat.</font>

114
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:40,652
<font color="yellow">He must take after me.</font>

115
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,082
<font color="yellow">He takes after me.</font>

116
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:45,052
<font color="yellow">At first, he didn't even touch meat. He only drank milk.</font>

117
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:48,652
<font color="yellow">As soon as his teeth came out, he started to eat meat like me.</font>

118
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:49,982
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything.</font>

119
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:53,152
<font color="yellow">What is in the bag?</font>

120
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:55,252
<font color="yellow">I bought some strawberries.</font>

121
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:59,022
<font color="yellow">I bought organic strawberries just for Soo Jo.</font>

122
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:02,582
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo, we're going to have meat later.</font>

123
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:04,122
<font color="yellow">Just wash your hands and wait.</font>

124
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:07,652
<font color="yellow">These are for your brother.</font>

125
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:10,382
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Look what you've done.</font>

126
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,682
<font color="yellow">You're the one who dropped them.</font>

127
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:14,752
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

128
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:16,552
<font color="yellow">Always ask before you eat.</font>

129
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:18,822
<font color="yellow">Don't just eat anything.</font>

130
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,522
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you think it's a waste if I eat them?</font>

131
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:23,022
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

132
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:25,482
<font color="yellow">I just wanted you to eat them with Soo Jo.</font>

133
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:27,352
<font color="yellow">Since when did you care so much about him?</font>

134
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:29,052
<font color="yellow">Am I not your child?</font>

135
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,652
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

136
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,922
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me. You'll only put me in a bad spot.</font>

137
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:44,582
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

138
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:46,152
<font color="yellow">You must be tired.</font>

139
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,652
<font color="yellow">Why are you still delivering water when you don't have to?</font>

140
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,752
<font color="yellow">- Dad, I'm here. - Hey.</font>

141
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:57,082
<font color="yellow">- I have meat ready to be cooked. - I ate already.</font>

142
00:07:57,422 --> 00:08:00,182
<font color="yellow">- But it's meat. - I don't want it.</font>

143
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:05,382
<font color="yellow">He never eats at home.</font>

144
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:07,952
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

145
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,122
<font color="yellow">- Should I grill some meat? - No, don't bother.</font>

146
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,622
<font color="yellow">I made some doenjang stew and braised tofu. Try them.</font>

147
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:22,782
<font color="yellow">- Where's Gong Joo? - She went out.</font>

148
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:25,122
<font color="yellow">She went out because she got upset.</font>

149
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,982
<font color="yellow">Why did she get upset?</font>

150
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:29,382
<font color="yellow">She got scolded because she tried to eat a strawberry.</font>

151
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:30,652
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about?</font>

152
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:33,882
<font color="yellow">She wasn't like that before, but she's acting rude lately.</font>

153
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:35,852
<font color="yellow">You should discipline her.</font>

154
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,652
<font color="yellow">How does it taste?</font>

155
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:47,052
<font color="yellow">It needs salt.</font>

156
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,682
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't eat too much salt.</font>

157
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:51,082
<font color="yellow">It should still have some flavour at least.</font>

158
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,352
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

159
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:56,052
<font color="yellow">I keep making things the way I like them.</font>

160
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:57,952
<font color="yellow">Should we hire a housekeeper?</font>

161
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:00,292
<font color="yellow">We should hire a housekeeper who can cook well.</font>

162
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:02,722
<font color="yellow">No, I can do a good job.</font>

163
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:05,722
<font color="yellow">Please be patient. I'm doing my best.</font>

164
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:16,822
<font color="yellow">Si Nae.</font>

165
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,982
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have a drink with me?</font>

166
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:25,982
<font color="yellow">You're troubled these days, aren't you?</font>

167
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:28,622
<font color="yellow">Both So Joo and Gong Joo...</font>

168
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:31,022
<font color="yellow">are causing you a lot of trouble.</font>

169
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:33,622
<font color="yellow">Whether I'm here or there,</font>

170
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:36,352
<font color="yellow">I run into mothers who go through hard times because of their kids.</font>

171
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:38,582
<font color="yellow">It's really not easy.</font>

172
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:40,222
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo has had...</font>

173
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,482
<font color="yellow">a trauma ever since he was young.</font>

174
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,722
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

175
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,122
<font color="yellow">He has a deep scar.</font>

176
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:48,652
<font color="yellow">Where is that scar?</font>

177
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:50,322
<font color="yellow">Is it on his stomach or his back?</font>

178
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:53,652
<font color="yellow">It's not a scar on his body. It's in his heart.</font>

179
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,422
<font color="yellow">We were always poor.</font>

180
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,752
<font color="yellow">So we moved around a lot, and he didn't have many friends.</font>

181
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:00,722
<font color="yellow">When something went missing at school,</font>

182
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:02,852
<font color="yellow">everyone suspected that Soo Jo stole it.</font>

183
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:05,982
<font color="yellow">He was teased because he didn't have a mother.</font>

184
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,252
<font color="yellow">I didn't know. I can't believe I dragged him to the police station.</font>

185
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,552
<font color="yellow">How is Ddol Ee?</font>

186
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:30,252
<font color="yellow">We'll have to observe him more.</font>

187
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,452
<font color="yellow">He may suffer from shock.</font>

188
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:36,222
<font color="yellow">A car accident can be a traumatic experience for a child.</font>

189
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:38,682
<font color="yellow">Let's wait and see.</font>

190
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:42,752
<font color="yellow">You said you were going to get your own place. What happened?</font>

191
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:45,822
<font color="yellow">I met Dr Choi recently.</font>

192
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:47,822
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking about going to Africa?</font>

193
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:49,882
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to Africa,</font>

194
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:54,152
<font color="yellow">but I may have to practice medicine again.</font>

195
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:57,522
<font color="yellow">Really? It would be nice for you to come back to the hospital.</font>

196
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,522
<font color="yellow">The chief asked about you recently.</font>

197
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:01,422
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get a paying job.</font>

198
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:03,582
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'm good with money.</font>

199
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:07,852
<font color="yellow">I wanted to become a rich doctor, but I guess that won't happen.</font>

200
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:09,482
<font color="yellow">Will you be a medical volunteer?</font>

201
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,382
<font color="yellow">I'm considering it.</font>

202
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,452
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mum.</font>

203
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:22,052
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

204
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,422
<font color="yellow">What? I'm at the store.</font>

205
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,052
<font color="yellow">Can you stop by?</font>

206
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:29,352
<font color="yellow">I won't talk about money. Just come.</font>

207
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,582
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mum. I'll stop by.</font>

208
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,782
<font color="yellow">You said you were at the store.</font>

209
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,882
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

210
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,722
<font color="yellow">I'm actually coming from there.</font>

211
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:45,852
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed like that?</font>

212
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:47,922
<font color="yellow">Why are you wearing those sandals?</font>

213
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,552
<font color="yellow">My friend lives nearby. I was visiting him.</font>

214
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,882
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to get some soju and ramyeon for him.</font>

215
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,282
<font color="yellow">I borrowed his sandals.</font>

216
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,152
<font color="yellow">These are comfortable.</font>

217
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,422
<font color="yellow">These are his clothes, too.</font>

218
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,952
<font color="yellow">This is so not like you.</font>

219
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:09,952
<font color="yellow">At school, everyone but you wore sandals.</font>

220
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,452
<font color="yellow">You said they didn't look cool.</font>

221
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:14,352
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised that you're wearing those.</font>

222
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:17,322
<font color="yellow">Every student in Korea wore those except you.</font>

223
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:19,522
<font color="yellow">That's right. I was the exception.</font>

224
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,782
<font color="yellow">Drop them off quickly, and let's go together.</font>

225
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:24,552
<font color="yellow">We can go right away. Did you go grocery shopping?</font>

226
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:27,322
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about it. You shouldn't carry this.</font>

227
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,652
<font color="yellow">I want to make some food for your sister.</font>

228
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:32,182
<font color="yellow">The hospital food is terrible.</font>

229
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,122
<font color="yellow">What is going on with your in-laws?</font>

230
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,052
<font color="yellow">They didn't even come to Gab Soon's wedding.</font>

231
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,252
<font color="yellow">They don't even come to the hospital to visit Ddol Ee.</font>

232
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:43,622
<font color="yellow">I told you that Grandfather and my mother-in-law are traveling.</font>

233
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,752
<font color="yellow">They're traveling?</font>

234
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:46,352
<font color="yellow">I thought they were on a business trip.</font>

235
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:49,482
<font color="yellow">Yes, they're overseas, so they're practically traveling.</font>

236
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:53,222
<font color="yellow">That old man is away for so long.</font>

237
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:54,952
<font color="yellow">What about your wife?</font>

238
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:57,622
<font color="yellow">It's obviously 1 of 2 reasons.</font>

239
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,352
<font color="yellow">Either she doesn't want to come...</font>

240
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:02,022
<font color="yellow">or she's just not able to.</font>

241
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:05,122
<font color="yellow">Are you having trouble with them?</font>

242
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:06,922
<font color="yellow">Did something happen at the company?</font>

243
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,922
<font color="yellow">- Nothing happened. - Did you fight with your wife?</font>

244
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,322
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that.</font>

245
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:29,622
<font color="yellow">I feel like Se Gye is going through some serious trouble.</font>

246
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,982
<font color="yellow">You feel that way, too, right?</font>

247
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:34,582
<font color="yellow">I'm sure everyone else will feel the same.</font>

248
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:35,922
<font color="yellow">What do you think is going on?</font>

249
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,652
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

250
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:42,222
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

251
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,452
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

252
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:49,582
<font color="yellow">"I didn't become living proof for this."</font>

253
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:53,182
<font color="yellow">Se Gye is probably saying that to himself.</font>

254
00:13:58,552 --> 00:13:59,782
<font color="yellow">I came to pick up the empty plates.</font>

255
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,082
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gab Dol. How are you doing?</font>

256
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,952
<font color="yellow">How dare you speak to me like I'm your friend?</font>

257
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,322
<font color="yellow">Address your senior properly.</font>

258
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:11,822
<font color="yellow">You are still a bachelor.</font>

259
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:13,322
<font color="yellow">I envy you.</font>

260
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,382
<font color="yellow">But I'll only be a loser if I keep envying you.</font>

261
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,222
<font color="yellow">You're already a loser.</font>

262
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,752
<font color="yellow">You used to like Gab Soon, but I took her away.</font>

263
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,822
<font color="yellow">I can't argue with that. I hope you live happily ever after.</font>

264
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,722
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry. I feel terrible.</font>

265
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:39,382
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

266
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:41,022
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

267
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:08,022
<font color="yellow">I am a public official.</font>

268
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:12,082
<font color="yellow">I must never get angry at a citizen.</font>

269
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,752
<font color="yellow">The citizens are...</font>

270
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,652
<font color="yellow">my bosses.</font>

271
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:21,952
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

272
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:23,782
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

273
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,052
<font color="yellow">When are you going to throw a party to celebrate your marriage?</font>

274
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:30,252
<font color="yellow">We'll set a date soon.</font>

275
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:32,822
<font color="yellow">Men usually look good when they get married.</font>

276
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,722
<font color="yellow">You actually look worse than before.</font>

277
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,822
<font color="yellow">- What? - Did you fight with your wife?</font>

278
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,152
<font color="yellow">How did you know? You're not even married.</font>

279
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,452
<font color="yellow">Feel free to ask me anything.</font>

280
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:45,252
<font color="yellow">I've become an expert on marriage thanks to my older sisters.</font>

281
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,752
<font color="yellow">Did you fight because of money?</font>

282
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,352
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be surprised.</font>

283
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,222
<font color="yellow">I'll give you advice soon.</font>

284
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:00,782
<font color="yellow">Honey, are you off work?</font>

285
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,452
<font color="yellow">Honey, are you watching me?</font>

286
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:07,382
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm going to keep an eye on you.</font>

287
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:11,452
<font color="yellow">Honey, don't go anywhere else. Go straight home.</font>

288
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:13,752
<font color="yellow">All right, Honey.</font>

289
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:24,282
<font color="yellow">It's cooking well. It looks delicious.</font>

290
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,822
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he here yet?</font>

291
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,352
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon's getting impatient waiting for his son-in-law.</font>

292
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:35,222
<font color="yellow">I may be hungry, but I'm not that impatient.</font>

293
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:39,022
<font color="yellow">It's him. He's here!</font>

294
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:47,822
<font color="yellow">- He's here. - You're home.</font>

295
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:50,582
<font color="yellow">Your cute son-in-law is here.</font>

296
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,182
<font color="yellow">Come here and sit.</font>

297
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:00,852
<font color="yellow">It's tasty.</font>

298
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:08,652
<font color="yellow">I made fish cake soup, your favourite.</font>

299
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:10,122
<font color="yellow">It's cold. Come home quick.</font>

300
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:16,682
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

301
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:28,622
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. I'm usually bored in the evenings.</font>

302
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:33,582
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Gab Dol, I'm having so much fun.</font>

303
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:38,682
<font color="yellow">Us three usually sit together in the long evenings.</font>

304
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:42,152
<font color="yellow">We would count how many wrinkles we have.</font>

305
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:44,852
<font color="yellow">In the past, we would catch lice together.</font>

306
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:46,252
<font color="yellow">Did you catch lice?</font>

307
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,682
<font color="yellow">That's not the only thing we did.</font>

308
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,782
<font color="yellow">What? Watch your language.</font>

309
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:53,052
<font color="yellow">I was going to say we watched television.</font>

310
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,252
<font color="yellow">Don't get ahead of yourself.</font>

311
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,822
<font color="yellow">You don't even look great from behind.</font>

312
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:02,382
<font color="yellow">Mother looks beautiful from behind.</font>

313
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,352
<font color="yellow">When did you see me from behind?</font>

314
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,182
<font color="yellow">"Why are you saying hello?"</font>

315
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:07,422
<font color="yellow">"Don't you talk to me."</font>

316
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:08,722
<font color="yellow">"Aren't you going to move?"</font>

317
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:11,882
<font color="yellow">"Do you think you can pass the exam if you walk around like this?"</font>

318
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,992
<font color="yellow">Then she turned around. The only thing I could see was her back.</font>

319
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:21,222
<font color="yellow">I understand how that would have gotten stuck in your mind.</font>

320
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:24,182
<font color="yellow">The image of her back as she turned around and walked away from you.</font>

321
00:18:32,552 --> 00:18:33,852
<font color="yellow">You're home early.</font>

322
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,952
<font color="yellow">- Have you eaten? - Come join us.</font>

323
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,052
<font color="yellow">I'm tired. I need to go out again after I take a short nap.</font>

324
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:42,322
<font color="yellow">It's not easy cleaning.</font>

325
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:44,382
<font color="yellow">Did you think it was going to be easy?</font>

326
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,782
<font color="yellow">He's always tired.</font>

327
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:50,152
<font color="yellow">I've never seen him with his eyes properly open.</font>

328
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:52,922
<font color="yellow">It's because he had to mind others ever since he was young.</font>

329
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:57,322
<font color="yellow">Have some of this.</font>

330
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:00,452
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

331
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,052
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

332
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:08,922
<font color="yellow">Are you ill?</font>

333
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:12,682
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

334
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,782
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me.</font>

335
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:19,752
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

336
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:22,182
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep.</font>

337
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:01,082
<font color="yellow">You should sleep in your room. Go sleep in your bedroom.</font>

338
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:02,622
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, you should go home.</font>

339
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:04,882
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

340
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:08,022
<font color="yellow">That must be Gab Dol's phone.</font>

341
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,552
<font color="yellow">(Mum)</font>

342
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:12,352
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, answer your phone.</font>

343
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:21,782
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Where are you?</font>

344
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:25,222
<font color="yellow">I called the office. They said you left a while ago. Where are you?</font>

345
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:27,422
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

346
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:32,992
<font color="yellow">Hello? Isn't this Gab Dol's phone?</font>

347
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:36,022
<font color="yellow">It's Gab Soon's mum. He's at our house.</font>

348
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,052
<font color="yellow">Why is he there?</font>

349
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,522
<font color="yellow">He had a few drinks with my husband.</font>

350
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:43,182
<font color="yellow">He had a few too many. He's sleeping now.</font>

351
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:45,682
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have made him drink so much.</font>

352
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:47,882
<font color="yellow">We didn't mean to.</font>

353
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,682
<font color="yellow">He can sleep over. Don't worry.</font>

354
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,722
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm going to go pick him up.</font>

355
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:56,582
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

356
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:01,722
<font color="yellow">She hung up when I wasn't even finished talking.</font>

357
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:05,222
<font color="yellow">She didn't even treat me like her in-law like I did.</font>

358
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:07,852
<font color="yellow">I can't grow fond of her at all.</font>

359
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:09,922
<font color="yellow">- Is she coming to pick him up? - I guess so.</font>

360
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:12,852
<font color="yellow">He's not a child. She's really overreacting.</font>

361
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:15,752
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

362
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,492
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

363
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,622
<font color="yellow">Get up. Go sleep in your room.</font>

364
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:28,382
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

365
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,552
<font color="yellow">What a disaster. Help me out.</font>

366
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:34,352
<font color="yellow">I don't have the strength to. Leave him here.</font>

367
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:37,452
<font color="yellow">That wench is on her way. Help me out.</font>

368
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:39,522
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

369
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:41,322
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

370
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:45,722
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

371
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:48,382
<font color="yellow">Why is he being like this today?</font>

372
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:50,782
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon got taller.</font>

373
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,382
<font color="yellow">He gained weight.</font>

374
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:55,322
<font color="yellow">He ate so well these days that his belly got so big.</font>

375
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,752
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. - Help me out.</font>

376
00:21:57,522 --> 00:22:01,682
<font color="yellow">This isn't why I made living proof.</font>

377
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:06,582
<font color="yellow">Don't let her in yet!</font>

378
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:08,482
<font color="yellow">- You're here. - Yes.</font>

379
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,552
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol. Oh, my.</font>

380
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,182
<font color="yellow">Please wake Gab Dol up.</font>

381
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:15,682
<font color="yellow">Please come in.</font>

382
00:22:15,922 --> 00:22:18,222
<font color="yellow">I don't think I should. Please wake him up for me.</font>

383
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:23,382
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol. Your mother is here. Wake up.</font>

384
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:30,552
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

385
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,522
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon is flaunting his large belly.</font>

386
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:37,552
<font color="yellow">- Gab Dol. - Your mother is here.</font>

387
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:39,822
<font color="yellow">My mum?</font>

388
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:43,122
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

389
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,622
<font color="yellow">- My mum's here. - Come on out.</font>

390
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,552
<font color="yellow">Why did you make him drink?</font>

391
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,582
<font color="yellow">We didn't force him.</font>

392
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:00,082
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink so much?</font>

393
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:02,422
<font color="yellow">I was happy, so I drank a little.</font>

394
00:23:02,822 --> 00:23:05,482
<font color="yellow">My father-in-law loves me so much.</font>

395
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:07,982
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

396
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:18,082
<font color="yellow">I feel better now.</font>

397
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:20,622
<font color="yellow">Why did you come?</font>

398
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:22,322
<font color="yellow">Why do you think?</font>

399
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:25,582
<font color="yellow">You were so drunk. You couldn't even answer your phone.</font>

400
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,822
<font color="yellow">I'm not a child. I can sleep over.</font>

401
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:30,352
<font color="yellow">Why would you sleep at a stranger's house?</font>

402
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:33,552
<font color="yellow">They're not strangers. They're my parents-in-law.</font>

403
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:36,052
<font color="yellow">Why do they call you over every day?</font>

404
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:37,722
<font color="yellow">I went there myself.</font>

405
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:39,182
<font color="yellow">They're fun to be with.</font>

406
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,522
<font color="yellow">They love me so much.</font>

407
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,522
<font color="yellow">Did you entertain them like you do for me?</font>

408
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,382
<font color="yellow">- A bit. - Don't do that to anyone else.</font>

409
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:49,082
<font color="yellow">They loved it.</font>

410
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:51,822
<font color="yellow">We don't have many people in our family, so it feels lonely.</font>

411
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,982
<font color="yellow">There are many people there.</font>

412
00:23:54,322 --> 00:23:57,152
<font color="yellow">So they fight over food. It makes it even more tasty.</font>

413
00:23:57,822 --> 00:24:00,582
<font color="yellow">- They want me to live there. - Are you insane?</font>

414
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:04,122
<font color="yellow">People hate living with their in-laws.</font>

415
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:07,152
<font color="yellow">Don't go there too often.</font>

416
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:10,322
<font color="yellow">You should meet them once in a while to be treated well.</font>

417
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:14,352
<font color="yellow">If you show your face too often, it'll seem like you lack discretion.</font>

418
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,252
<font color="yellow">What if you make a mistake when you're drunk?</font>

419
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:18,252
<font color="yellow">They'll blame it on you not having a father.</font>

420
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,282
<font color="yellow">Only visit them on holidays from now on.</font>

421
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:23,752
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - What?</font>

422
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,352
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Why you...</font>

423
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:52,422
<font color="yellow">- Are you asleep? - No.</font>

424
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:54,152
<font color="yellow">I want ramyeon.</font>

425
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:57,252
<font color="yellow">I want some too.</font>

426
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:38,952
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

427
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:42,482
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to eat ramyeon with you late at night.</font>

428
00:25:43,452 --> 00:25:44,452
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

429
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,322
<font color="yellow">I thought people living in big houses like this were all happy.</font>

430
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:53,452
<font color="yellow">- But I guess not. - You're just not comfortable yet.</font>

431
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:55,852
<font color="yellow">Once you get used to this place, you'll become happy.</font>

432
00:25:58,322 --> 00:25:59,552
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

433
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:02,682
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo. Hey.</font>

434
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:04,652
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

435
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,822
<font color="yellow">(Nam Gi Ja)</font>

436
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:30,952
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

437
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:32,782
<font color="yellow">What time is it now?</font>

438
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:35,752
<font color="yellow">It's late.</font>

439
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:38,652
<font color="yellow">Get changed and sleep comfortably.</font>

440
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:41,382
<font color="yellow">I don't mind. I'm too sleepy.</font>

441
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:03,622
<font color="yellow">Tell your wife to wake up.</font>

442
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,652
<font color="yellow">It's not fair for the mother-in-law to cook for her.</font>

443
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:09,722
<font color="yellow">- She's sleeping. - That's why you should wake her up.</font>

444
00:27:10,582 --> 00:27:13,252
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon already told you that she can't cook breakfast.</font>

445
00:27:14,122 --> 00:27:16,922
<font color="yellow">She has to do what a daughter-in-law should do at least for a month.</font>

446
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:20,252
<font color="yellow">How could she abuse me just because she earns money?</font>

447
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,982
<font color="yellow">She has to at least show that she's trying...</font>

448
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:25,552
<font color="yellow">in order for me to feel bad and say that I'll cook for her.</font>

449
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:28,822
<font color="yellow">She is shameless to sleep until broad daylight.</font>

450
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:31,882
<font color="yellow">She came in at dawn and fell asleep without even washing.</font>

451
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:33,482
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to earn money.</font>

452
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:36,982
<font color="yellow">And I wouldn't know that because I never made money, right?</font>

453
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:39,282
<font color="yellow">You've been working for a while now, but Gab Soon...</font>

454
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,522
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I'm okay because I'm made of steal,</font>

455
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:43,622
<font color="yellow">and your wife is not because she is fragile?</font>

456
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:48,952
<font color="yellow">To be honest, you guys are working hard to feed yourselves, not me.</font>

457
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:52,052
<font color="yellow">She ignores me because you act like this.</font>

458
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:54,252
<font color="yellow">If you can't wake her up, I will.</font>

459
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:57,382
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop it. I'll cook then.</font>

460
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:02,552
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

461
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,482
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Mother.</font>

462
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:16,152
<font color="yellow">It's not a good morning for me.</font>

463
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:22,452
<font color="yellow">Even if you came home late, how could you not see your husband off?</font>

464
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:24,782
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol told me that I didn't need to.</font>

465
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:26,752
<font color="yellow">Calling your husband by his name isn't appropriate.</font>

466
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:29,022
<font color="yellow">You said you'll respect him as your husband.</font>

467
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:31,482
<font color="yellow">I don't know what else to call him.</font>

468
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:34,822
<font color="yellow">And I heard that I shouldn't call him "Honey" in front of our parents.</font>

469
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,782
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful from now on.</font>

470
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:40,952
<font color="yellow">And why does your dad call Gab Dol over so often?</font>

471
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:44,152
<font color="yellow">He has to go to work, but your dad offers him drinks.</font>

472
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:46,682
<font color="yellow">Does he need someone to drink with?</font>

473
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:48,952
<font color="yellow">He has a lot of friends to drink with.</font>

474
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,622
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live with your parents later?</font>

475
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:54,482
<font color="yellow">We never said we will.</font>

476
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:58,482
<font color="yellow">My parents don't want to live with their children.</font>

477
00:28:58,852 --> 00:28:59,852
<font color="yellow">They don't want to burden us.</font>

478
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:02,522
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying I live with my children to burden them?</font>

479
00:29:02,922 --> 00:29:06,222
<font color="yellow">That's not it. They said living with their kids is hard for them, too,</font>

480
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:07,682
<font color="yellow">since they need to be careful.</font>

481
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:10,382
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll wash quickly and go to work.</font>

482
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:13,482
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

483
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,622
<font color="yellow">I didn't call him over.</font>

484
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:20,282
<font color="yellow">He came here himself.</font>

485
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:23,182
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous. Did he say your dad called him over?</font>

486
00:29:23,382 --> 00:29:26,522
<font color="yellow">Send him back early from now and don't give him too much alcohol.</font>

487
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:28,182
<font color="yellow">He has a hard time waking up.</font>

488
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:29,522
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

489
00:29:30,152 --> 00:29:32,322
<font color="yellow">I thought he said I was the best.</font>

490
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:35,622
<font color="yellow">It won't be a problem if we live alone, but his mum doesn't like it.</font>

491
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,422
<font color="yellow">Did you tell him that you want to live with us later?</font>

492
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:38,622
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

493
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:41,582
<font color="yellow">I guess she got angry and took it out on Gab Soon.</font>

494
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:44,952
<font color="yellow">Everything goes around and comes to Gab Soon in the end, so be careful.</font>

495
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:48,852
<font color="yellow">I think I should live with you to make her go mad.</font>

496
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:50,952
<font color="yellow">I won't live with you.</font>

497
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,222
<font color="yellow">Do you have any problems with your mother-in-law?</font>

498
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:57,282
<font color="yellow">No, I don't. Gab Dol tells me to do as I want.</font>

499
00:29:57,682 --> 00:30:00,052
<font color="yellow">I guess he doesn't want you to feel small in front of his mum.</font>

500
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,452
<font color="yellow">- Who takes care of the money? - I do.</font>

501
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,722
<font color="yellow">I took care of the money ever since we started dating.</font>

502
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:07,352
<font color="yellow">I also got his passbook from my mother-in-law.</font>

503
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:08,782
<font color="yellow">You even got his passbook?</font>

504
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,082
<font color="yellow">- Did she give it to you right away? - Yes.</font>

505
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:13,522
<font color="yellow">You did a good job. You're smart.</font>

506
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:16,582
<font color="yellow">I told you not to worry about me. I'm Gab Soon.

507
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:18,622
<font color="yellow">- Gab Soon, let's go. - Okay.</font>

508
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:20,822
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Bye.</font>

509
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,752
<font color="yellow">My gosh, you didn't even get enough sleep.</font>

510
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:27,722
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, don't make Dal Pa work too hard.</font>

511
00:30:28,282 --> 00:30:29,422
<font color="yellow">He became thinner.</font>

512
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:44,422
<font color="yellow">Did he go out without eating breakfast again?</font>

513
00:30:44,752 --> 00:30:46,822
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm not sure if he eats outside or not.</font>

514
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:51,552
<font color="yellow">Please don't eat ramyeon at night.</font>

515
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:55,352
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Did you eat ramyeon?</font>

516
00:30:55,982 --> 00:30:57,252
<font color="yellow">Yes. It became a habit.</font>

517
00:30:57,852 --> 00:31:01,552
<font color="yellow">He should start eating with us and stop delivering water soon.</font>

518
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:03,752
<font color="yellow">He won't listen to anybody.</font>

519
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:07,182
<font color="yellow">There's one person he'll listen to.</font>

520
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:21,322
<font color="yellow">I thought no one was home.</font>

521
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:23,822
<font color="yellow">If anyone finds out about this,</font>

522
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:26,282
<font color="yellow">I'll get kicked out.</font>

523
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:29,782
<font color="yellow">- No one's home, right? - Yes.</font>

524
00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:32,452
<font color="yellow">Geum Do Geum!</font>

525
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:42,522
<font color="yellow">Slow down. You'll get an upset stomach.</font>

526
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:46,122
<font color="yellow">You said you'll get kicked out if anyone finds out.</font>

527
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:49,022
<font color="yellow">They won't be home any time soon. I'm just worried about Soo Jo.</font>

528
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:52,122
<font color="yellow">I can't watch him deliver water any more.</font>

529
00:31:52,382 --> 00:31:53,582
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo is worried, too.</font>

530
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:56,482
<font color="yellow">He's having a hard time living here,</font>

531
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,582
<font color="yellow">but I think he's putting up with it because of me.</font>

532
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:00,422
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

533
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:03,652
<font color="yellow">If I were him, I'd stay here comfortably and let them feed me.</font>

534
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,052
<font color="yellow">They would even call a chef for me if I asked for one.</font>

535
00:32:07,752 --> 00:32:10,882
<font color="yellow">I wish I had a chance to live in a house like this.</font>

536
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,582
<font color="yellow">Your life must've become much better now.</font>

537
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,982
<font color="yellow">It became so much better that I feel burdened.</font>

538
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:22,452
<font color="yellow">Do Geum, please get a job for me.</font>

539
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:24,182
<font color="yellow">I'll ask if they need a driver.</font>

540
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:27,522
<font color="yellow">In the military, I used to cook, and you used to drive.</font>

541
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:29,422
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop talking about the military.</font>

542
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,882
<font color="yellow">Let it go now. You're only making yourself suffer.</font>

543
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:33,552
<font color="yellow">Could you let it go if it were you?</font>

544
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,252
<font color="yellow">I'll never forget about anything.</font>

545
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:42,352
<font color="yellow">Stop grinding your teeth.</font>

546
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:44,852
<font color="yellow">Think about how to deal with Soo Jo.</font>

547
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:47,952
<font color="yellow">There's a tactic you use often.</font>

548
00:33:00,422 --> 00:33:01,452
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

549
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,022
<font color="yellow">Let me do this with you.</font>

550
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,522
<font color="yellow">You can't do it.</font>

551
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:09,552
<font color="yellow">- If you can, I can do it, too. - Stop it.</font>

552
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:11,352
<font color="yellow">You'll hurt your back.</font>

553
00:33:13,352 --> 00:33:14,922
<font color="yellow">You don't like me working here, right?</font>

554
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:16,922
<font color="yellow">The same goes for me.</font>

555
00:33:17,522 --> 00:33:18,922
<font color="yellow">You're putting me in a difficult situation.</font>

556
00:33:19,152 --> 00:33:21,682
<font color="yellow">Would you be okay if your kid delivered water without eating?</font>

557
00:33:22,182 --> 00:33:25,222
<font color="yellow">Why won't you listen to me? Did I raise you to be like this?</font>

558
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,322
<font color="yellow">If you keep doing this,</font>

559
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,822
<font color="yellow">I will vanish without a trace.</font>

560
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:41,052
<font color="yellow">I washed up in a long time. I feel so refreshed.</font>

561
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:43,752
<font color="yellow">It's tiring to take care of a patient.</font>

562
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:47,282
<font color="yellow">On top of that, it's your own child. You must've gone through a lot.</font>

563
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:48,722
<font color="yellow">You lost so much weight.</font>

564
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:51,152
<font color="yellow">She lost weight without having to spend any money.</font>

565
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:54,052
<font color="yellow">Please think before you speak.</font>

566
00:33:54,052 --> 00:33:56,422
<font color="yellow">She didn't lose weight because she went on a diet.</font>

567
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:58,552
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

568
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,652
<font color="yellow">I set the table for you. Go ahead and eat some.</font>

569
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,752
<font color="yellow">And take the side dishes I made.</font>

570
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:05,452
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mum.</font>

571
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:09,752
<font color="yellow">Excuse me! Excuse me!</font>

572
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,222
<font color="yellow">Somebody, please come help!</font>

573
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:15,322
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

574
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:16,952
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

575
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:19,282
<font color="yellow">Quickly please. My Ddol Ee is almost dying.</font>

576
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:34,082
<font color="yellow">Did Ddol Ee go to get a checkup?</font>

577
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:35,622
<font color="yellow">Come to the intensive care unit.</font>

578
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:43,322
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

579
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:45,852
<font color="yellow">I don't know. It was so sudden.</font>

580
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,982
<font color="yellow">Pull yourself together.</font>

581
00:34:49,182 --> 00:34:50,182
<font color="yellow">We can't afford to be weak.</font>

582
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:52,582
<font color="yellow">We have to hold on just like Ddol Ee.</font>

583
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:55,822
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

584
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:57,892
<font color="yellow">He passed the crisis now.</font>

585
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:00,652
<font color="yellow">Because it was such a big accident for your child,</font>

586
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:02,282
<font color="yellow">I think he was in shock.</font>

587
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:03,852
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

588
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:07,222
<font color="yellow">After watching him for a while, we'll move him to a general ward.</font>

589
00:35:07,782 --> 00:35:10,922
<font color="yellow">If this ever happens again, don't get flustered too much.</font>

590
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:13,182
<font color="yellow">We'll check him up again tomorrow.</font>

591
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:15,852
<font color="yellow">He will be okay for now.</font>

592
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:35,822
<font color="yellow">Back when...</font>

593
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:39,082
<font color="yellow">you and Se Gye wanted to get married,</font>

594
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:41,952
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't be on your side.</font>

595
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,522
<font color="yellow">Se Bang is trying really hard this time.</font>

596
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,522
<font color="yellow">Of course he should. It's his own son.</font>

597
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,782
<font color="yellow">In the past, he'd just leave everything with Jae Soon.</font>

598
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:59,122
<font color="yellow">He would try to make up for everything by just giving her money.</font>

599
00:35:59,652 --> 00:36:03,082
<font color="yellow">When Ddol Ee had surgery before, he didn't even come to see him.</font>

600
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:04,752
<font color="yellow">He's become mature.</font>

601
00:36:04,982 --> 00:36:07,152
<font color="yellow">He should be mature. He's old enough.</font>

602
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,922
<font color="yellow">When Ddol Ee leaves the hospital,</font>

603
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,722
<font color="yellow">they should get back together and live with their child.</font>

604
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:15,152
<font color="yellow">Who are you to decide?</font>

605
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:19,452
<font color="yellow">I talked to Jae Soon earlier, but she didn't say much about it.</font>

606
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:23,082
<font color="yellow">- She didn't? - She must've learned a lesson.</font>

607
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,582
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

608
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:29,922
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

609
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:41,722
<font color="yellow">(Father)</font>

610
00:36:43,222 --> 00:36:44,252
<font color="yellow">Hello, Father.</font>

611
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,782
<font color="yellow">Stop by my house after you get off work.</font>

612
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:48,282
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

613
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:51,482
<font color="yellow">(Mum)</font>

614
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:54,582
<font color="yellow">- What's up, Mum? - Are you coming late today?</font>

615
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:57,052
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner together.</font>

616
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:59,222
<font color="yellow">I have to stop by Gab Soon's parents' place.</font>

617
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,182
<font color="yellow">Again? I told you to visit them only on holidays.</font>

618
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:04,922
<font color="yellow">Father wants to see me.</font>

619
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:07,282
<font color="yellow">It won't take long.</font>

620
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:09,252
<font color="yellow">I can't stay long because I'm tired anyway.</font>

621
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:11,282
<font color="yellow">If you're tired, just make up an excuse and don't go.</font>

622
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,522
<font color="yellow">I can't do that. Bye, Mum.</font>

623
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:19,482
<font color="yellow">I can't believe he's bothering my son like this.</font>

624
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:22,722
<font color="yellow">I'm so thankful they're not well off.</font>

625
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:25,282
<font color="yellow">If they were rich, they would abuse him even more.</font>

626
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,282
<font color="yellow">A real man...</font>

627
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:33,182
<font color="yellow">shouldn't talk about what happened outside of his home.</font>

628
00:37:33,922 --> 00:37:37,892
<font color="yellow">Do you tell your mother about every little thing that happened to you?</font>

629
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:39,822
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell her anything.</font>

630
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:42,452
<font color="yellow">You're the one who decided to come here yesterday.</font>

631
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:45,282
<font color="yellow">- You told her I called you over? - That's...</font>

632
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:48,922
<font color="yellow">You don't need to tell your mother everything.</font>

633
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:51,552
<font color="yellow">You told her that we said we'd like to live with you.</font>

634
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:54,352
<font color="yellow">You told her I looked lonely because I don't have anyone to drink with.</font>

635
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:57,222
<font color="yellow">You also told her that I forced you to stay even though you were tired.</font>

636
00:37:57,822 --> 00:38:00,622
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to say anything to you from now on?</font>

637
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:05,282
<font color="yellow">There are two things men should be careful about.</font>

638
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:07,252
<font color="yellow">One is your mouth.</font>

639
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:11,022
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have a big mouth if you want to become successful.</font>

640
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:15,652
<font color="yellow">I see. But what's the other thing?</font>

641
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:19,782
<font color="yellow">The other thing that men should always be careful about is...</font>

642
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:24,452
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with you? - Stop talking nonsense.</font>

643
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,892
<font color="yellow">Can't I talk about this in front of him?</font>

644
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:30,582
<font color="yellow">He's married. He should know what he's supposed to know.</font>

645
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,682
<font color="yellow">- Men... - That's...</font>

646
00:38:32,982 --> 00:38:35,722
<font color="yellow">should be careful with their pockets.</font>

647
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:38,822
<font color="yellow">A heavy wallet makes a proud man.</font>

648
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:40,392
<font color="yellow">That's right. Your pocket.</font>

649
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:42,722
<font color="yellow">I was thinking the same thing.</font>

650
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:44,282
<font color="yellow">I'll keep that in mind.</font>

651
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:49,082
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, how much money are you going to give to Gab Soon's parents?</font>

652
00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:50,282
<font color="yellow">Money?</font>

653
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:52,622
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon is supposed to take care of that.</font>

654
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:55,082
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon is going to take care of it?</font>

655
00:38:55,422 --> 00:38:57,582
<font color="yellow">How much money per month?</font>

656
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:00,922
<font color="yellow">I'll finally receive some pocket money thanks to you.</font>

657
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:06,252
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

658
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:17,582
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

659
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,152
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

660
00:39:19,152 --> 00:39:21,482
<font color="yellow">You should come see me if you're home.</font>

661
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:24,352
<font color="yellow">You just said "I'm home". Is that it?</font>

662
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:25,582
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm tired.</font>

663
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:28,482
<font color="yellow">You went to see your in-laws, but you have no energy to say hi to me?</font>

664
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:31,752
<font color="yellow">Don't add on to the scolding I got from them.</font>

665
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:35,052
<font color="yellow">What? What did you do to get a scolding from them?</font>

666
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:37,282
<font color="yellow">- What did they say? - Nothing.</font>

667
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:38,982
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get changed. Close the door.</font>

668
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:45,982
<font color="yellow">They say you lose your son once he gets married.</font>

669
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:48,822
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who raised him to become a public official,</font>

670
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,392
<font color="yellow">but they're treating him like he's their own.</font>

671
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,982
<font color="yellow">Don't go to their house any more. Don't answer their calls, either.</font>

672
00:39:56,392 --> 00:39:57,482
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

673
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:06,022
<font color="yellow">My goodness. It's burning.</font>

674
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:10,452
<font color="yellow">I didn't even get to eat this. What a waste.</font>

675
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:13,622
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have gotten married to her.</font>

676
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:17,282
<font color="yellow">My gosh, he has such a bad taste in women.</font>

677
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,982
<font color="yellow">He must've gotten it from his dad.</font>

678
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:22,722
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's hot.</font>

679
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:32,182
<font color="yellow">Allowance?</font>

680
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:34,422
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to give each of our parents' any allowance?</font>

681
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:36,582
<font color="yellow">All of my married friends give some money to their parents.</font>

682
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,052
<font color="yellow">Didn't you give me the right to decide?</font>

683
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,622
<font color="yellow">So you're not going to give them any?</font>

684
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,252
<font color="yellow">Think about it. We don't even have a house.</font>

685
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,282
<font color="yellow">We're living with your mother because we can't afford to pay rent.</font>

686
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:47,622
<font color="yellow">How can we give them money?</font>

687
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,122
<font color="yellow">You mother seemed to want some.</font>

688
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:53,322
<font color="yellow">Just ignore what she says. Think about it.</font>

689
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,452
<font color="yellow">If we give money to each of our parents every month...</font>

690
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:58,352
<font color="yellow">and give them money again on every birthday and holiday, it's too much.</font>

691
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,422
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't be so cheap.</font>

692
00:41:00,622 --> 00:41:01,752
<font color="yellow">We need to save money.</font>

693
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:04,452
<font color="yellow">Both of our parents are wealthier than us right now.</font>

694
00:41:04,682 --> 00:41:07,152
<font color="yellow">We should just endure it until we get our own house.</font>

695
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:09,452
<font color="yellow">But that would be very rude of us.</font>

696
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:12,082
<font color="yellow">Since we're married now, we're adults.</font>

697
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:15,982
<font color="yellow">I think we should at least give some money to our parents to thank them.</font>

698
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:18,552
<font color="yellow">Many parents brag about how much money they got from their children.</font>

699
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:19,922
<font color="yellow">But my mum gets nothing.</font>

700
00:41:20,822 --> 00:41:22,582
<font color="yellow">My mum went through so much.</font>

701
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,582
<font color="yellow">The same goes for your parents.</font>

702
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,722
<font color="yellow">How much do you think is enough?</font>

703
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,022
<font color="yellow">About 500 dollars?</font>

704
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:30,582
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

705
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,152
<font color="yellow">- At least 300 dollars. - 300 dollars?</font>

706
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:36,552
<font color="yellow">If it's 300 dollars for each person, that adds up to 900 dollars.</font>

707
00:41:36,652 --> 00:41:38,022
<font color="yellow">Think about how much we earn.</font>

708
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:40,452
<font color="yellow">We'll end up with nothing forever.</font>

709
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:43,582
<font color="yellow">- What about 200 dollars? - Still, it'd be 600 dollars.</font>

710
00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:46,022
<font color="yellow">To us, 600 dollars a month isn't a small amount of money.</font>

711
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:47,822
<font color="yellow">What about 100 dollars?</font>

712
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:50,922
<font color="yellow">If your parents get 200 dollars and my mum gets 100 dollars,</font>

713
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:52,582
<font color="yellow">that would be unfair.</font>

714
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:55,052
<font color="yellow">It's fair. It's 100 dollars per person.</font>

715
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,652
<font color="yellow">If your house gets 200 dollars, my house deserves 200 dollars as well.</font>

716
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,552
<font color="yellow">Your mum works.</font>

717
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:03,052
<font color="yellow">Then ask your mum to work as well.</font>

718
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:06,152
<font color="yellow">- What? - What you're saying is nonsense.</font>

719
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,892
<font color="yellow">My mum went through a lot.</font>

720
00:42:09,322 --> 00:42:11,622
<font color="yellow">The least we can do is give her enough pocket money.</font>

721
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:13,122
<font color="yellow">Your mum isn't the only one who went through a lot.</font>

722
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:15,982
<font color="yellow">You always tell me that she's been through a lot.</font>

723
00:42:16,352 --> 00:42:18,422
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because we don't have enough money ourselves.</font>

724
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:21,122
<font color="yellow">I want to give her a lot of money, too.</font>

725
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:22,722
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to let me handle it.</font>

726
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:25,822
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Why do we have to fight over 100 dollars?</font>

727
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:29,752
<font color="yellow">You take care of the money.</font>

728
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,482
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be like this?</font>

729
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:34,582
<font color="yellow">- Then you cook. - What?</font>

730
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:37,452
<font color="yellow">Even when my mum delivered milk and worked at a restaurant,</font>

731
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:40,182
<font color="yellow">she never once forgot to make a meal for us.</font>

732
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:42,852
<font color="yellow">She prepared breakfast for us everyday.</font>

733
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,482
<font color="yellow">But just because you earn some money, you don't even cook.</font>

734
00:42:46,052 --> 00:42:49,122
<font color="yellow">What did you say? I earn more than you do.</font>

735
00:42:49,322 --> 00:42:51,222
<font color="yellow">You should cook. It's your family anyway.</font>

736
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:52,422
<font color="yellow">"Your family"?</font>

737
00:42:52,892 --> 00:42:55,982
<font color="yellow">That's what you're doing. You keep defending your mum.</font>

738
00:42:56,482 --> 00:42:58,522
<font color="yellow">If you feel so bad for your mum, you should live with her.</font>

739
00:42:58,622 --> 00:43:00,022
<font color="yellow">Why did you even get married?</font>

740
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,852
<font color="yellow">Get out! Right now!</font>

741
00:43:13,082 --> 00:43:15,082
<font color="yellow">This is not why let you get married.</font>

742
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:17,482
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have let you live here in the first place.</font>

743
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:18,822
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

744
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:40,982
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

745
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,782
<font color="yellow">I'll quit delivering water.</font>

746
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,422
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Soo Jo.</font>

747
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:45,952
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

748
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,152
<font color="yellow">Thank you for this, Professor.</font>

749
00:43:48,822 --> 00:43:51,382
<font color="yellow">It's no big deal. I just tried my best.</font>

750
00:43:52,022 --> 00:43:53,922
<font color="yellow">So what do you want to do now?</font>

751
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:58,152
<font color="yellow">Since you don't want me to deliver water, I'll look for another job.</font>

752
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:00,322
<font color="yellow">Dad, tell him.</font>

753
00:44:00,922 --> 00:44:03,922
<font color="yellow">How about working as a director in my company?</font>

754
00:44:05,752 --> 00:44:06,752
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

755
00:44:08,952 --> 00:44:12,182
<font color="yellow">I've only seen directors in dramas.</font>

756
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:14,122
<font color="yellow">We'll appoint you as the director right away.</font>

757
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,022
<font color="yellow">How can you appoint me as a director like this?</font>

758
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:19,622
<font color="yellow">Stay still. You're going to become a director.</font>

759
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:23,622
<font color="yellow">I want you to take the position and learn about the company.</font>

760
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:25,822
<font color="yellow">I don't even know anything about your company.</font>

761
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,682
<font color="yellow">I can't start as a director.</font>

762
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:30,222
<font color="yellow">Give me some time to learn.</font>

763
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:32,652
<font color="yellow">Learn? Do you want to go to a university?</font>

764
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:34,152
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to study abroad?</font>

765
00:44:34,622 --> 00:44:35,682
<font color="yellow">That's not what I mean.</font>

766
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:39,552
<font color="yellow">I also didn't go to a university, but I have no problem working.</font>

767
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:41,022
<font color="yellow">Then what do you want to learn?</font>

768
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,522
<font color="yellow">He wants to learn the work at the company.</font>

769
00:44:42,822 --> 00:44:43,822
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

770
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:45,252
<font color="yellow">Which department is the most difficult to work in?</font>

771
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,782
<font color="yellow">- It's the warehouse. - I'll work there then.</font>

772
00:44:47,782 --> 00:44:48,882
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

773
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:51,352
<font color="yellow">It's very poorly paid and difficult. It's not for you.</font>

774
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:54,552
<font color="yellow">You don't have to do a heavy task. Do an easy one.</font>

775
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:56,482
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

776
00:44:56,722 --> 00:44:58,852
<font color="yellow">You can start from there. The meeting is over.</font>

777
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:06,752
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have left home like that.</font>

778
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:09,922
<font color="yellow">Are you going to end things with Gong Joo?</font>

779
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:12,182
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

780
00:45:13,322 --> 00:45:15,682
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you didn't register your marriage. It made things easier.</font>

781
00:45:16,722 --> 00:45:19,782
<font color="yellow">You should come to work, though. You still have a lot to do.</font>

782
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,552
<font color="yellow">No, thanks.</font>

783
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:24,922
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for canceling on your position.</font>

784
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:28,782
<font color="yellow">It must've been hard for you since it happened so suddenly.</font>

785
00:45:29,182 --> 00:45:31,822
<font color="yellow">I hope you understand our situation.</font>

786
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:36,382
<font color="yellow">I understand it must be hard for you, but you should come back.</font>

787
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:40,782
<font color="yellow">That won't happen. I'm sorry.</font>

788
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:42,652
<font color="yellow">Are you serious about this?</font>

789
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:47,082
<font color="yellow">You're really going to divorce Gong Joo, too?</font>

790
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:49,882
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

791
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:53,652
<font color="yellow">What did your parents say?</font>

792
00:45:56,822 --> 00:46:00,522
<font color="yellow">He hasn't told his parents. That means he hasn't made up his mind.</font>

793
00:46:01,022 --> 00:46:02,222
<font color="yellow">I want you to meet him and talk him out of it.</font>

794
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:03,852
<font color="yellow">What's the point?</font>

795
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,352
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't cut off relationships frivolously like that.</font>

796
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:07,882
<font color="yellow">You should think about Gong Joo.</font>

797
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:09,982
<font color="yellow">I will handle it myself.</font>

798
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:12,882
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo is my daughter. I will do what's right for her.</font>

799
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:15,322
<font color="yellow">However, I can't treat him and my son equally.</font>

800
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:17,882
<font color="yellow">I think he has some ambitious plans.</font>

801
00:46:18,182 --> 00:46:19,752
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I will handle this situation.</font>

802
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:24,822
<font color="yellow">Okay. She's your child, so you should handle it.</font>

803
00:46:51,582 --> 00:46:52,622
<font color="yellow">Kids.</font>

804
00:46:53,782 --> 00:46:55,382
<font color="yellow">Can you do me a favour?</font>

805
00:46:58,822 --> 00:47:01,452
<font color="yellow">An old man asked us to give this to you.</font>

806
00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:05,152
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Bye.</font>

807
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:10,552
<font color="yellow">This letter will be the first and last from me.</font>

808
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:13,552
<font color="yellow">Now that I look back,</font>

809
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:17,452
<font color="yellow">the time I spent working at your home...</font>

810
00:48:18,122 --> 00:48:20,952
<font color="yellow">was the highlight of my life.</font>

811
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:24,522
<font color="yellow">I was so happy as a woman.</font>

812
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:29,822
<font color="yellow">I hate you, but I don't blame you.</font>

813
00:48:30,622 --> 00:48:32,982
<font color="yellow">I know that you can't do whatever you want to do.</font>

814
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:36,252
<font color="yellow">Although it didn't last,</font>

815
00:48:36,852 --> 00:48:39,122
<font color="yellow">you made me feel alive.</font>

816
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:41,652
<font color="yellow">I thank you for that.</font>

817
00:48:44,682 --> 00:48:46,782
<font color="yellow">The gift that you sent for my son's wedding...</font>

818
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:49,652
<font color="yellow">will be given to my son.</font>

819
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:52,752
<font color="yellow">I will never forget your generosity.</font>

820
00:48:54,582 --> 00:48:56,082
<font color="yellow">Please don't be sick.</font>

821
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,682
<font color="yellow">Make sure you eat well.</font>

822
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:03,122
<font color="yellow">In another life,</font>

823
00:49:03,882 --> 00:49:06,082
<font color="yellow">I'm praying that we will both be single...</font>

824
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:10,252
<font color="yellow">so that we don't have to worry about what our children might think.</font>

825
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,022
<font color="yellow">Why are you quitting so suddenly?</font>

826
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:32,522
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, our sales have gone up.</font>

827
00:49:32,922 --> 00:49:34,182
<font color="yellow">I have a personal reason.</font>

828
00:49:34,422 --> 00:49:36,982
<font color="yellow">What is that reason? Please tell us.</font>

829
00:49:37,282 --> 00:49:40,882
<font color="yellow">We were getting ready to promote you as our CEO soon.</font>

830
00:49:41,322 --> 00:49:43,722
<font color="yellow">Please tell us why you're doing this.</font>

831
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:45,952
<font color="yellow">Did we do anything to cause you to make this decision?</font>

832
00:49:46,852 --> 00:49:48,082
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with the company.</font>

833
00:49:49,082 --> 00:49:50,982
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you because it's personal.</font>

834
00:49:51,382 --> 00:49:53,652
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you're asking us to transfer you to an office overseas.</font>

835
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,352
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

836
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,622
<font color="yellow">Please do this for me.</font>

837
00:49:57,822 --> 00:49:58,922
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

838
00:49:59,382 --> 00:50:01,122
<font color="yellow">I will be going overseas soon.</font>

839
00:50:01,682 --> 00:50:03,082
<font color="yellow">- When? - Very soon.</font>

840
00:50:03,552 --> 00:50:04,582
<font color="yellow">I just wanted you to know.</font>

841
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:07,022
<font color="yellow">- Where will you be going? - I'm not sure yet.</font>

842
00:50:09,522 --> 00:50:11,052
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do?</font>

843
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:14,682
<font color="yellow">You have to take care of yourself.</font>

844
00:50:14,952 --> 00:50:17,282
<font color="yellow">I wanted to find you a nice husband.</font>

845
00:50:18,152 --> 00:50:19,952
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I wasn't able to do that.</font>

846
00:50:20,982 --> 00:50:23,482
<font color="yellow">- Will you be gone for a long time? - I will be gone for a few years.</font>

847
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,182
<font color="yellow">Go back to your dorm.</font>

848
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,622
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

849
00:50:28,822 --> 00:50:29,852
<font color="yellow">I will tell them myself.</font>

850
00:50:30,122 --> 00:50:31,482
<font color="yellow">Can I go with you?</font>

851
00:50:31,752 --> 00:50:33,282
<font color="yellow">What will you do if you quit your job?</font>

852
00:50:35,852 --> 00:50:36,982
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

853
00:50:37,852 --> 00:50:39,522
<font color="yellow">don't go near Go Dal Pa.</font>

854
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:43,022
<font color="yellow">I don't. He's the one following me around.</font>

855
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:44,252
<font color="yellow">Regardless.</font>

856
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:46,382
<font color="yellow">What kind of name is Go Dal Pa anyway?</font>

857
00:50:46,982 --> 00:50:49,152
<font color="yellow">He'll only make you suffer.</font>

858
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:21,822
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

859
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:24,722
<font color="yellow">- It's cold, isn't it? - It's not bad.</font>

860
00:51:25,422 --> 00:51:27,352
<font color="yellow">I love eels.</font>

861
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:28,552
<font color="yellow">What about Ddol Ee?</font>

862
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,782
<font color="yellow">I forced him to fall asleep so I can come out quickly.</font>

863
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:34,952
<font color="yellow">As I was waiting for you,</font>

864
00:51:35,282 --> 00:51:38,152
<font color="yellow">my heart was beating so much.</font>

865
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:40,482
<font color="yellow">I felt the same way.</font>

866
00:51:41,452 --> 00:51:43,982
<font color="yellow">I never felt that way when we lived together.</font>

867
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:48,122
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. I think I've fallen for you.</font>

868
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:13,052
<font color="yellow">Get in the car, Soo Jo.</font>

869
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:14,152
<font color="yellow">I will take the bus.</font>

870
00:53:14,352 --> 00:53:15,622
<font color="yellow">You don't know the way.</font>

871
00:53:16,322 --> 00:53:17,452
<font color="yellow">Just get in.</font>

872
00:53:21,522 --> 00:53:22,522
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

873
00:53:22,722 --> 00:53:24,722
<font color="yellow">- Dad, I will see you later. - Bye.</font>

874
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,322
<font color="yellow">Do you know how to drive?</font>

875
00:53:42,982 --> 00:53:44,182
<font color="yellow">I guess you do.</font>

876
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,652
<font color="yellow">Would you like me to buy you a car?</font>

877
00:53:47,252 --> 00:53:50,522
<font color="yellow">Pick any car you'd like regardless of the price.</font>

878
00:53:51,022 --> 00:53:52,122
<font color="yellow">I don't want one.</font>

879
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:55,622
<font color="yellow">Okay. If you don't want it, that's fine.</font>

880
00:54:09,952 --> 00:54:11,822
<font color="yellow">I talked to the factory manager.</font>

881
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:14,082
<font color="yellow">You told me not to, so I didn't tell him about our relationship.</font>

882
00:54:15,222 --> 00:54:17,222
<font color="yellow">I will work just like the other workers here.</font>

883
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:23,252
<font color="yellow">Don't do any difficult tasks. You can quit any time.</font>

884
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:34,122
<font color="yellow">Who is Geum Soo Jo? I heard he's the new employee.</font>

885
00:54:36,422 --> 00:54:37,452
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

886
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:39,282
<font color="yellow">It's you?</font>

887
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:42,022
<font color="yellow">We meet again. It's nice to see you.</font>

888
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,482
<font color="yellow">The manager told me to supervise you.</font>

889
00:54:47,582 --> 00:54:49,852
<font color="yellow">That means you need to follow my order.</font>

890
00:54:50,422 --> 00:54:52,582
<font color="yellow">- Did you quit delivering water? - Yes.</font>

891
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,322
<font color="yellow">Ask me if you have any questions.</font>

892
00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:57,352
<font color="yellow">Hey, you!</font>

893
00:54:57,552 --> 00:55:00,522
<font color="yellow">Did you clean up everything? I told you to work quickly.</font>

894
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,352
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

895
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:04,182
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

896
00:55:09,882 --> 00:55:12,522
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am, the strawberries are nice. - Okay.</font>

897
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,422
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam!</font>

898
00:55:19,782 --> 00:55:21,052
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh!</font>

899
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,052
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You're embarrassing me.</font>

900
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:25,152
<font color="yellow">Meeting you so unexpectedly...</font>

901
00:55:25,352 --> 00:55:27,322
<font color="yellow">feels like reuniting with a long lost family member.</font>

902
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:29,122
<font color="yellow">Do you live around here?</font>

903
00:55:29,782 --> 00:55:30,882
<font color="yellow">I live nearby.</font>

904
00:55:32,052 --> 00:55:33,552
<font color="yellow">I take care of the house, you see.</font>

905
00:55:34,352 --> 00:55:37,352
<font color="yellow">Let's have a drink together.</font>

906
00:55:38,322 --> 00:55:39,452
<font color="yellow">Get off me.</font>

907
00:55:43,652 --> 00:55:45,282
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to tell me?</font>

908
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:47,052
<font color="yellow">Why are we meeting here?</font>

909
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:49,622
<font color="yellow">Let's eat first.</font>

910
00:56:04,422 --> 00:56:06,722
<font color="yellow">I don't want anything from his marriage,</font>

911
00:56:08,822 --> 00:56:10,422
<font color="yellow">but I feel very sad.</font>

912
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:15,022
<font color="yellow">I wonder why I tried so hard to raise him.</font>

913
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:18,882
<font color="yellow">I guess it was all for nothing.</font>

914
00:56:21,822 --> 00:56:23,422
<font color="yellow">Life is so meaningless,</font>

915
00:56:25,022 --> 00:56:26,852
<font color="yellow">and I feel so lonely.</font>

916
00:56:29,752 --> 00:56:31,882
<font color="yellow">Don't let Gab Dol dictate your life.</font>

917
00:56:32,882 --> 00:56:36,082
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam, do you want to go to a club?</font>

918
00:56:36,722 --> 00:56:39,782
<font color="yellow">My friend can set you up with a nice gentleman.</font>

919
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,552
<font color="yellow">He's so popular among older ladies.</font>

920
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:47,122
<font color="yellow">There are many old men who receive pension there.</font>

921
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:51,522
<font color="yellow">A lot of older ladies come just to meet them.</font>

922
00:56:56,652 --> 00:56:58,282
<font color="yellow">Tell me when you're ready to go.</font>

923
00:56:59,022 --> 00:57:02,822
<font color="yellow">You will feel less lonely if you meet a nice, rich old man.</font>

924
00:57:11,522 --> 00:57:12,752
<font color="yellow">I know that...</font>

925
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:15,982
<font color="yellow">you've suffered a lot.</font>

926
00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:21,582
<font color="yellow">Now that Soo Jo is at home and working at our company,</font>

927
00:57:23,222 --> 00:57:26,082
<font color="yellow">take some time off and go travel.</font>

928
00:57:27,082 --> 00:57:28,822
<font color="yellow">You've suffered a lot, too.</font>

929
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:32,222
<font color="yellow">Si Nae.</font>

930
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:36,622
<font color="yellow">I have a wish that I want you to grant.</font>

931
00:57:37,282 --> 00:57:38,352
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

932
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:42,252
<font color="yellow">Every day has been torture,</font>

933
00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:45,682
<font color="yellow">but I kept it in because of your missing son.</font>

934
00:57:46,622 --> 00:57:49,852
<font color="yellow">I don't think I have a lot of time left.</font>

935
00:57:50,722 --> 00:57:52,552
<font color="yellow">Are you ill?</font>

936
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:57,152
<font color="yellow">I'm not seriously ill.</font>

937
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:03,382
<font color="yellow">How many days do I have left in me?</font>

938
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:05,822
<font color="yellow">They say that people can live until 100 these days,</font>

939
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:09,882
<font color="yellow">but I think it's meaningless to live...</font>

940
00:58:10,522 --> 00:58:14,052
<font color="yellow">the rest of your days at a hospital or a nursing home.</font>

941
00:58:15,082 --> 00:58:18,522
<font color="yellow">It's important to live a healthy life.</font>

942
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:20,582
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

943
00:58:21,622 --> 00:58:22,852
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

944
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:24,752
<font color="yellow">about that Pas lady?</font>

945
00:58:25,722 --> 00:58:27,952
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will...</font>

946
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:30,882
<font color="yellow">marry her.</font>

947
00:58:32,252 --> 00:58:33,882
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Don't talk me out of it.</font>

948
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:36,352
<font color="yellow">It's my wish...</font>

949
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:39,922
<font color="yellow">to live with a woman I love.</font>

950
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:44,182
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking for your approval. I'm notifying you.</font>

951
00:58:44,482 --> 00:58:46,652
<font color="yellow">Dad, are you out of your mind?</font>

952
00:58:49,722 --> 00:58:52,522
<font color="yellow">- My mind is sound as ever. - Let's go to the hospital.</font>

953
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:54,582
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you think I have dementia?</font>

954
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:57,122
<font color="yellow">It's strange that you're being so unreasonable.</font>

955
00:58:57,182 --> 00:58:59,682
<font color="yellow">I got a check up recently. I'm perfectly fine.</font>

956
00:58:59,782 --> 00:59:01,382
<font color="yellow">I can't allow this marriage.</font>

957
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:03,782
<font color="yellow">Do you know why?</font>

958
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:05,282
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

959
00:59:06,052 --> 00:59:07,782
<font color="yellow">you are way older than her.</font>

960
00:59:08,182 --> 00:59:11,722
<font color="yellow">When there is a large age gap, there has to be another motive.</font>

961
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:14,822
<font color="yellow">Second, she has her own children.</font>

962
00:59:15,082 --> 00:59:17,652
<font color="yellow">How can we be sure that she won't steal our money from us?</font>

963
00:59:18,252 --> 00:59:20,682
<font color="yellow">You may not see it clearly right now.</font>

964
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:22,282
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

965
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:25,482
<font color="yellow">Why do you think she came to work at our house?</font>

966
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:28,652
<font color="yellow">Why do you think she was so nice to you?</font>

967
00:59:29,222 --> 00:59:31,982
<font color="yellow">It's so obvious. Why can't you see that?</font>

968
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:34,822
<font color="yellow">I know. I saw those things in the news.</font>

969
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:39,582
<font color="yellow">My friend was a victim, too. However, she's different.</font>

970
00:59:39,882 --> 00:59:41,022
<font color="yellow">I already tested her.</font>

971
00:59:41,222 --> 00:59:43,182
<font color="yellow">Just ask her one question.</font>

972
00:59:44,022 --> 00:59:46,082
<font color="yellow">If you weren't the CEO,</font>

973
00:59:46,622 --> 00:59:49,382
<font color="yellow">and you were penniless,</font>

974
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:51,182
<font color="yellow">would she still get married to you?</font>

975
00:59:51,452 --> 00:59:53,682
<font color="yellow">I'm 70 years old. I can tell what kind of person she is.</font>

976
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:56,722
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you could before. Now, I don't think you can.</font>

977
00:59:57,522 --> 01:00:00,882
<font color="yellow">Your decision making skills have deteriorated. You're being rash.</font>

978
01:00:01,122 --> 01:00:04,482
<font color="yellow">Even if I'm wrong, it's still my decision.</font>

979
01:00:04,482 --> 01:00:07,482
<font color="yellow">Dad, get it together. Other people will mock at you.</font>

980
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:10,152
<font color="yellow">Why? Is it because they'll think I'm too old to get married?</font>

981
01:00:10,552 --> 01:00:12,922
<font color="yellow">Is it because they'll think I'm senile? I don't care.</font>

982
01:00:12,982 --> 01:00:15,782
<font color="yellow">Frankly, it's not like you need a woman by your side at your age.</font>

983
01:00:19,752 --> 01:00:20,982
<font color="yellow">If you're asking...</font>

984
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,622
<font color="yellow">if I can still function as a man,</font>

985
01:00:26,352 --> 01:00:27,552
<font color="yellow">yes, I'm still...</font>

986
01:00:28,182 --> 01:00:29,222
<font color="yellow">a man.</font>

987
01:00:30,082 --> 01:00:32,052
<font color="yellow">I know that it's embarrassing to say this in front of my child,</font>

988
01:00:32,422 --> 01:00:35,352
<font color="yellow">but I'm still a man and a human being.</font>

989
01:00:36,352 --> 01:00:37,822
<font color="yellow">Don't treat me like a corpse because I'm old.</font>

990
01:00:38,022 --> 01:00:39,352
<font color="yellow">Do I have to get your permission...</font>

991
01:00:39,722 --> 01:00:41,752
<font color="yellow">to see a woman because of I'm old?</font>

992
01:00:41,752 --> 01:00:45,182
<font color="yellow">You're not dating her. You're marrying her.</font>

993
01:00:45,782 --> 01:00:49,082
<font color="yellow">You want to get officially married so that she can inherit your wealth.</font>

994
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:56,322
<font color="yellow">- What floor are we on? - The 10th floor.</font>

995
01:00:56,852 --> 01:00:58,782
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I have to hear such things from my child.</font>

996
01:01:01,082 --> 01:01:02,952
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live a life like this.</font>

997
01:01:06,982 --> 01:01:09,482
<font color="yellow">The window won't open. It's fixed.</font>

998
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:20,122
<font color="yellow">At my age,</font>

999
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:25,722
<font color="yellow">I may seem like a woman crazed, senile old man.</font>

1000
01:01:26,522 --> 01:01:30,222
<font color="yellow">I may seem like an old man waiting to die.</font>

1001
01:01:34,252 --> 01:01:35,252
<font color="yellow">But I am...</font>

1002
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:37,552
<font color="yellow">still alive and well.</font>

1003
01:01:39,182 --> 01:01:40,222
<font color="yellow">I've been...</font>

1004
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,682
<font color="yellow">so lonely.</font>

1005
01:01:44,822 --> 01:01:45,852
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

1006
01:01:46,922 --> 01:01:48,452
<font color="yellow">live alone any more.</font>

1007
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:52,522
<font color="yellow">Why are you lonely? You have a child and grandchildren.</font>

1008
01:01:52,952 --> 01:01:54,852
<font color="yellow">I've been living alone, too.</font>

1009
01:01:57,682 --> 01:01:59,052
<font color="yellow">You're still young,</font>

1010
01:02:00,152 --> 01:02:01,552
<font color="yellow">but I'm old.</font>

1011
01:02:02,622 --> 01:02:05,152
<font color="yellow">- I don't have many chances. - If you're lonely,</font>

1012
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:07,322
<font color="yellow">I will find someone...</font>

1013
01:02:07,782 --> 01:02:09,852
<font color="yellow">who's closer to your age and without children.</font>

1014
01:02:10,822 --> 01:02:12,782
<font color="yellow">If you insist on going through with this,</font>

1015
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:14,722
<font color="yellow">I have my own plans.</font>
