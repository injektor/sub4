1
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:07,324
<font color="yellow">Why are you here so late?</font>

2
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:10,594
<font color="yellow">I sneaked out, so I have to get back in before my mother notices.</font>

3
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:12,954
<font color="yellow">This may sound inappropriate to say right now,</font>

4
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:14,994
<font color="yellow">but let's not see each other any more.</font>

5
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:18,324
<font color="yellow">Geum Do Geum. Delivery service.</font>

6
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:30,594
<font color="yellow">I thought he might not have clothes for this occasion, so I bought some.</font>

7
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,594
<font color="yellow">Please let him wear these when he meets me.</font>

8
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,554
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if this is the right size.</font>

9
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:38,754
<font color="yellow">I just made a rough guess. I hope my dear Soo Jo will like them.</font>

10
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:43,024
<font color="yellow">I hope my dear Soo Jo...</font>

11
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:45,824
<font color="yellow">My dear Soo Jo. My dear Soo Jo.</font>

12
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:28,224
<font color="yellow">This is mine.</font>

13
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:31,624
<font color="yellow">- Just for today. - That is the newest one.</font>

14
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,624
<font color="yellow">I have a business meeting today.</font>

15
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:39,094
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I need to eat some, too.</font>

16
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,224
<font color="yellow">Even if my parents live next door, I won't see them.</font>

17
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,994
<font color="yellow">Even if they are rich, I don't care.</font>

18
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:50,724
<font color="yellow">I only need you.</font>

19
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,494
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that,</font>

20
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:54,294
<font color="yellow">- my son. - Open up.</font>

21
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,824
<font color="yellow">Are you going to send him off tomorrow?</font>

22
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:14,894
<font color="yellow">I should.</font>

23
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:19,954
<font color="yellow">I prepared dinner for him for the last time,</font>

24
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,024
<font color="yellow">but he hasn't come home yet.</font>

25
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:24,424
<font color="yellow">He must be busy delivering alcohol.</font>

26
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:27,654
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be okay alone after you send him?</font>

27
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:30,324
<font color="yellow">You guys stuck together like twin brothers.</font>

28
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:32,454
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard, but I should still send him.</font>

29
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:36,694
<font color="yellow">I'm going leave far away, too.</font>

30
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,124
<font color="yellow">Where to?</font>

31
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:40,894
<font color="yellow">You don't have any family. Where are you going to go?</font>

32
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:44,354
<font color="yellow">Just like the nature of the wind and waves,</font>

33
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:46,194
<font color="yellow">I will just wander around.</font>

34
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,524
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for you.</font>

35
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:55,024
<font color="yellow">You got something from them, didn't you?</font>

36
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:56,824
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

37
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:59,654
<font color="yellow">They must have expressed their gratitude to you.</font>

38
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,554
<font color="yellow">Do Geum, you're life will change now that you sold off your son.</font>

39
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,894
<font color="yellow">Sold off my son? Take that back.</font>

40
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:10,354
<font color="yellow">But it's true.</font>

41
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:13,124
<font color="yellow">You had a tough time raising him for 32 years.</font>

42
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,154
<font color="yellow">Of course, you should receive good money.</font>

43
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,224
<font color="yellow">You... You jerk.</font>

44
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,294
<font color="yellow">- Help! - You punk.</font>

45
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,354
<font color="yellow">What's your problem?</font>

46
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:24,854
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

47
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:27,424
<font color="yellow">Hey. Are you crazy?</font>

48
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:31,454
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Oh, my.</font>

49
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:33,624
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

50
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:42,524
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Why did you have to come in right at that moment?</font>

51
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:43,694
<font color="yellow">You should've ducked.</font>

52
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:46,794
<font color="yellow">That totally woke me up.</font>

53
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:48,924
<font color="yellow">Did you have a fight with Sam Sik?</font>

54
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,354
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about Sam Sik any more.</font>

55
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:54,394
<font color="yellow">What a brat. I even hate that he eats three meals a day.</font>

56
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:56,394
<font color="yellow">I thought you were jealous of him.</font>

57
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:58,694
<font color="yellow">Why did you prepare dinner?</font>

58
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:00,194
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

59
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:06,154
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

60
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:13,524
<font color="yellow">I heated it again and again, so it boiled down too much.</font>

61
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,354
<font color="yellow">It's your favourite, beef radish soup.</font>

62
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:17,364
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry. Let's eat now.</font>

63
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,594
<font color="yellow">Are you considering this as our last meal?</font>

64
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,094
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I'm not going to eat.</font>

65
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:25,224
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat.</font>

66
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:28,194
<font color="yellow">Don't say a word and just do as I tell you to.</font>

67
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:30,994
<font color="yellow">After eating dinner, let's go to a bathhouse.</font>

68
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,694
<font color="yellow">Is that another part of your farewell ceremony?</font>

69
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:36,624
<font color="yellow">- You should scrub off your dirt. - I don't like scrubbing.</font>

70
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:38,824
<font color="yellow">You know I don't like taking baths.</font>

71
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:40,724
<font color="yellow">Do you want to look filthy when you meet them?</font>

72
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:43,624
<font color="yellow">Take a bath and wear new clothes before you meet them.</font>

73
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,054
<font color="yellow">You look so skinny these days.</font>

74
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:49,864
<font color="yellow">If you look so skinny and dirty when you meet them,</font>

75
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:51,224
<font color="yellow">they'll blame me for that.</font>

76
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,494
<font color="yellow">I'm 32 years old already.</font>

77
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:55,364
<font color="yellow">You treat me like a three-year-old baby.</font>

78
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:57,454
<font color="yellow">To me, you're still a baby.</font>

79
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,194
<font color="yellow">Are you going to obey me or not?</font>

80
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,054
<font color="yellow">Fine, I will.</font>

81
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:05,054
<font color="yellow">I'll eat and gain weight. Then let's go to a bathhouse.</font>

82
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,054
<font color="yellow">It's delicious to eat late at night.</font>

83
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,224
<font color="yellow">- Did Ms Nam cook this? - Yes.</font>

84
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:16,024
<font color="yellow">We don't have a kitchen.</font>

85
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,994
<font color="yellow">If we had one, I would've cooked everything.</font>

86
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,824
<font color="yellow">Don't expect anything else.</font>

87
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:24,424
<font color="yellow">When I meet her, I'm going to ask her just one thing and come back.</font>

88
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:28,024
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You should live with them.</font>

89
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:32,294
<font color="yellow">I can't let you enjoy your life alone without me.</font>

90
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:36,894
<font color="yellow">You should eat, too. You're giving the expensive fish only to me.</font>

91
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,854
<font color="yellow">I can eat the head of the fish.</font>

92
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:42,424
<font color="yellow">I guess you're really not my biological father.</font>

93
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,894
<font color="yellow">The head is the most delicious part.</font>

94
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,194
<font color="yellow">Watch out. You'll spill everything.</font>

95
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,124
<font color="yellow">My son.</font>

96
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:16,494
<font color="yellow">I thought you were sleeping.</font>

97
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:18,894
<font color="yellow">No. I couldn't fall asleep.</font>

98
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,094
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have a drink, too?</font>

99
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,194
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to drink alcohol.</font>

100
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:28,724
<font color="yellow">Having a drink or two won't kill me.</font>

101
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:34,294
<font color="yellow">I just can't wait to meet him.</font>

102
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,824
<font color="yellow">I can't fall asleep because I'm so anxious and nervous.</font>

103
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,654
<font color="yellow">The fact that I'm meeting your son for the first time...</font>

104
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:45,194
<font color="yellow">feels surreal and makes me confused.</font>

105
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:47,654
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're going through worse.</font>

106
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,224
<font color="yellow">I should've seen him more carefully when he came to deliver water.</font>

107
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:55,324
<font color="yellow">Since I didn't pay attention to him, I don't remember how he looked.</font>

108
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,254
<font color="yellow">I think he was quite tall.</font>

109
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:02,494
<font color="yellow">Who does he resemble?</font>

110
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,454
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

111
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,954
<font color="yellow">He must've went through a lot.</font>

112
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,324
<font color="yellow">He didn't get to go to college, and he's now delivering water.</font>

113
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:14,224
<font color="yellow">It's quite obvious that he's not doing so well.</font>

114
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:18,054
<font color="yellow">It's heartbreaking.</font>

115
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:23,554
<font color="yellow">Do you think he'll blame us for not looking for him in the past?</font>

116
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,894
<font color="yellow">I'll devote my life to him and treat him well.</font>

117
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,954
<font color="yellow">I'll try to compensate for all the hardships he had to go through.</font>

118
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,354
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

119
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:34,424
<font color="yellow">You should take responsibility for giving birth to him.</font>

120
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,124
<font color="yellow">That's what a parent should do.</font>

121
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:50,294
<font color="yellow">Are you that desperate to become the director?</font>

122
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,054
<font color="yellow">Just pretend like it never happened.</font>

123
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,224
<font color="yellow">I thought sons were useless.</font>

124
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,194
<font color="yellow">But I guess it's nice to have one around.</font>

125
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:12,494
<font color="yellow">Is it delicious?</font>

126
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:14,754
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look like it's from an ordinary supermarket.</font>

127
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,824
<font color="yellow">It's from a bakery. It's expensive.</font>

128
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:19,394
<font color="yellow">My taste buds must know that it's expensive.</font>

129
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:22,724
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon bought this.</font>

130
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:24,854
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

131
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:28,224
<font color="yellow">I won't eat this.</font>

132
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:30,924
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

133
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,464
<font color="yellow">Did she tell you to coax me with these biscuits?</font>

134
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:34,694
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

135
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,494
<font color="yellow">Did you think I would change my mind because of some biscuits?</font>

136
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:38,754
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

137
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:40,124
<font color="yellow">You make me go crazy.</font>

138
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:42,854
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon isn't like that. She's a nice girl.</font>

139
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,354
<font color="yellow">A nice girl? Then am I mean?</font>

140
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,554
<font color="yellow">Are you taking her side in front of me?</font>

141
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:49,694
<font color="yellow">I'm not taking her side. I'm just telling you the truth.</font>

142
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:53,964
<font color="yellow">She walked me home saying that you'll be lonely on a day like this.</font>

143
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:57,624
<font color="yellow">Other girls would've expected to have a date at a fancy restaurant.</font>

144
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:59,554
<font color="yellow">That's the kind of person she is.</font>

145
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:02,494
<font color="yellow">She bought me biscuits and sent me home so I could spend time with you.</font>

146
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:06,024
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Do you expect me to be so grateful about that?</font>

147
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:08,464
<font color="yellow">How could you just fall for her tricks?</font>

148
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:11,054
<font color="yellow">Whenever I did what she told me to, everything turned out good.</font>

149
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:14,854
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon always took care of everything I couldn't.</font>

150
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:17,994
<font color="yellow">I never once forgot your birthday thanks to Gab Soon.</font>

151
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:20,154
<font color="yellow">She's also the one who told me to study to become a public official.</font>

152
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,094
<font color="yellow">Are you Gab Soon's servant or what?</font>

153
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:24,194
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm her servant.</font>

154
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:26,594
<font color="yellow">I can't do anything without her.</font>

155
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,024
<font color="yellow">I did everything because she told me to.</font>

156
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:31,024
<font color="yellow">And was there any kind of bad outcome?</font>

157
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:33,894
<font color="yellow">She helped me become a public official. You don't know anything.</font>

158
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:37,594
<font color="yellow">What a brat. Look at how you're talking to your own mother.</font>

159
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:39,294
<font color="yellow">If you get married to her,</font>

160
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:42,594
<font color="yellow">you'll only take her side and completely ignore me.</font>

161
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:44,094
<font color="yellow">It's obvious.</font>

162
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,394
<font color="yellow">- Ms Nam. - What is it?</font>

163
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:51,424
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

164
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,494
<font color="yellow">Please be quiet.</font>

165
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,194
<font color="yellow">My son just fell asleep.</font>

166
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,994
<font color="yellow">Why does everyone in your family have such a loud voice?</font>

167
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:05,824
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam. If you yell like that, men won't like you.</font>

168
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:33,624
<font color="yellow">If you want to do it, do it right.</font>

169
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,964
<font color="yellow">Do you think splashing water on your face is enough?</font>

170
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:38,224
<font color="yellow">Don't even think that I'll give in.</font>

171
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:42,054
<font color="yellow">Even though you demonstrate against me in various ways, I won't budge.</font>

172
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:43,964
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

173
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:47,754
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol! Be quiet!</font>

174
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:51,354
<font color="yellow">Today must be a day for water splashes.</font>

175
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,054
<font color="yellow">Let's not see each other any more.</font>

176
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:06,724
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we both have a lot to say,</font>

177
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:11,794
<font color="yellow">but let's just end this.</font>

178
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:25,594
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

179
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:33,324
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

180
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,794
<font color="yellow">What brings you here at this hour?</font>

181
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:37,154
<font color="yellow">I got so frustrated, so I came here in the middle of washing rice.</font>

182
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:38,524
<font color="yellow">In the middle of washing rice?</font>

183
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:40,594
<font color="yellow">Should I go in, or should I say it here?</font>

184
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:43,754
<font color="yellow">- The kids are sleeping. - Then I'll say it here.</font>

185
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,854
<font color="yellow">I don't need this.</font>

186
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:49,354
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

187
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:52,094
<font color="yellow">Is this to fend me off?</font>

188
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,854
<font color="yellow">Be honest. I was shocked so I couldn't say anything earlier.</font>

189
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:58,794
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to break up? Is it because of your ex-wife?</font>

190
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:02,294
<font color="yellow">I just woke up, so I don't understand what you're saying.</font>

191
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:04,894
<font color="yellow">You asked to meet, but you didn't text me or call me once.</font>

192
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:07,224
<font color="yellow">Were you trying to test me or what?</font>

193
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:09,694
<font color="yellow">Then you suddenly came to see me at night wanting to break up.</font>

194
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,524
<font color="yellow">Are you seeing her again?</font>

195
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,254
<font color="yellow">It's not because of my ex-wife.</font>

196
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,594
<font color="yellow">That's enough. I saw you meeting her mother.</font>

197
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,624
<font color="yellow">- I saw you give her money. - It's not what you think.</font>

198
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:22,154
<font color="yellow">Did you give her money because you feel sorry for your ex-wife?</font>

199
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:25,924
<font color="yellow">No. I was just returning the money she gave me for the children.</font>

200
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,994
<font color="yellow">I felt sorry that she had to go through such hardship.</font>

201
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:31,654
<font color="yellow">What about me? Do you think I'm not going through anything?</font>

202
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:33,124
<font color="yellow">That's not what I mean.</font>

203
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:35,754
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be a part of this any more.</font>

204
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:39,694
<font color="yellow">I already went through enough when we were living together.</font>

205
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:41,554
<font color="yellow">You want to end things?</font>

206
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:45,294
<font color="yellow">Is there even anything to end? What are we anyway?</font>

207
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:47,594
<font color="yellow">Fine, let's end it.</font>

208
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:49,694
<font color="yellow">I haven't opened it yet.</font>

209
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:52,324
<font color="yellow">But since we're breaking up, I don't need to.</font>

210
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,224
<font color="yellow">Where did you go in the middle of washing rice?</font>

211
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:23,954
<font color="yellow">I just went out for a walk.</font>

212
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,394
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

213
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:29,394
<font color="yellow">I went for a walk.</font>

214
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:32,324
<font color="yellow">It's freezing cold. Why did you go out?</font>

215
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:35,124
<font color="yellow">I hope you would stop asking me questions.</font>

216
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:37,254
<font color="yellow">There are days when I want to go out for a walk.</font>

217
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:44,424
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Why are both my daughters like that?</font>

218
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:46,154
<font color="yellow">I can't believe their my daughters.</font>

219
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:07,054
<font color="yellow">I have something to say. Should I do it here or outside?</font>

220
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:09,824
<font color="yellow">I'm busy as you can see. I have nothing to hear from you.</font>

221
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:14,094
<font color="yellow">If you're going to apologise, don't. I don't want to hear it.</font>

222
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:16,224
<font color="yellow">I'm not here to apologise.</font>

223
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,224
<font color="yellow">I couldn't respond yesterday because...</font>

224
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,854
<font color="yellow">I was only half awake, not because I didn't have anything to say.</font>

225
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:22,894
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I was hurt as well?</font>

226
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:26,154
<font color="yellow">- Why were you hurt? - Why would I want to break up?</font>

227
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:28,194
<font color="yellow">Because you don't have feelings for me any more.</font>

228
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,224
<font color="yellow">There's no way that will happen.</font>

229
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:36,254
<font color="yellow">It's not only you. I saw you too.</font>

230
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:38,024
<font color="yellow">I saw you meet Ddol Ee's father.</font>

231
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:42,294
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon. Come quick!</font>

232
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,124
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

233
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:58,194
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

234
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:01,094
<font color="yellow">Your mum sent it for you. Wear it.</font>

235
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:02,424
<font color="yellow">How does she know my size?</font>

236
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:04,694
<font color="yellow">- That's easy to figure out. - Did she see me?</font>

237
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:07,654
<font color="yellow">She didn't see you. I told her.</font>

238
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:09,654
<font color="yellow">Do I need to?</font>

239
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,024
<font color="yellow">She bought it for you, so you should wear it.</font>

240
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,994
<font color="yellow">Look. She sent you clothes.</font>

241
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:19,724
<font color="yellow">These are expensive brand clothes.</font>

242
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,194
<font color="yellow">I can't buy you things like these.</font>

243
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:26,594
<font color="yellow">I can only buy you fakes or second-hand clothes.</font>

244
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:30,154
<font color="yellow">I still can't believe that I have a mum.</font>

245
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,024
<font color="yellow">I don't really feel anything.</font>

246
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:38,694
<font color="yellow">I don't miss her since I've never seen her. I'm not interested.</font>

247
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,624
<font color="yellow">There were times when I wanted a mum.</font>

248
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:43,924
<font color="yellow">But now, I'm not glad to meet her.</font>

249
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,524
<font color="yellow">That was only when I was little.</font>

250
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,354
<font color="yellow">I don't need a mum now. I'm all grown up.</font>

251
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:53,754
<font color="yellow">- Do I need to see her today? - You do.</font>

252
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,124
<font color="yellow">Change into these.</font>

253
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,494
<font color="yellow">You look handsome. You're the best.</font>

254
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:22,394
<font color="yellow">- What this? - Your luggage.</font>

255
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:26,094
<font color="yellow">I packed your underwear and socks. I picked the ones without holes.</font>

256
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:28,524
<font color="yellow">She'll probably buy you new ones.</font>

257
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:31,024
<font color="yellow">You should have some spare ones in the meantime.</font>

258
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,194
<font color="yellow">You can't be bare naked underneath.</font>

259
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:39,294
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

260
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,424
<font color="yellow">You should go. It's the seventh floor.</font>

261
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,094
<font color="yellow">Aren't you coming?</font>

262
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:07,024
<font color="yellow">Why should I go? It'll be awkward.</font>

263
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,254
<font color="yellow">- You should go alone. - No, come with me.</font>

264
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:12,924
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting here. Hurry up.</font>

265
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:16,854
<font color="yellow">You have to stay here. It won't take more than five minutes.</font>

266
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,024
<font color="yellow">You should at least eat and talk with her.</font>

267
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,594
<font color="yellow">What is there to talk about?</font>

268
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:25,954
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to ask her why she abandoned me.</font>

269
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:30,454
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

270
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:33,794
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

271
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:37,324
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

272
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:41,524
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to take another look at you.</font>

273
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,194
<font color="yellow">You look handsome.</font>

274
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:47,224
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

275
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:56,854
<font color="yellow">Geum Soo Jo.</font>

276
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:00,554
<font color="yellow">You need to live happily.</font>

277
00:18:03,494 --> 00:18:04,524
<font color="yellow">My son.</font>

278
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:08,194
<font color="yellow">Farewell.</font>

279
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,524
<font color="yellow">My son. You're so adorable.</font>

280
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,494
<font color="yellow">Study after you finish eating this.</font>

281
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,454
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

282
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:38,294
<font color="yellow">- You must be cold. - I'm cold.</font>

283
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,194
<font color="yellow">You must be tired.</font>

284
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:43,664
<font color="yellow">It'd be nice if you could quit your job.</font>

285
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,324
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat? I'll cook you something.</font>

286
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,454
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

287
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:55,054
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm hungry.</font>

288
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:57,594
<font color="yellow">Mum, stop it.</font>

289
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,594
<font color="yellow">Mum, I love you more than anything in the world.</font>

290
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:05,524
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

291
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:09,164
<font color="yellow">Stop walking around and have a seat. You're making me anxious.</font>

292
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:10,524
<font color="yellow">I'm nervous.</font>

293
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:12,554
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

294
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:14,994
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he coming?</font>

295
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,024
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

296
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:37,754
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

297
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,224
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

298
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:52,164
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo!</font>

299
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,024
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo, wait.</font>

300
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,024
<font color="yellow">Please. Just talk to me.</font>

301
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:02,454

00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:13,154
<font color="yellow">I have indigestion.</font>

416
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,724
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

417

418
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,694

419
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:30,294

420
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,224

422
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:37,524

<font color="yellow">I saw the kids today.</font>

424

425
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:46,954
<font color="yellow">They live in the rooftop house across the intersection.</font>

426
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:51,294
<font color="yellow">I followed Cho Rong there. It's a mess.</font>

427
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:55,294
<font color="yellow">It's so windy that my hands were frozen from the cold.</font>

428
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:58,324
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about the kids.</font>

429
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:00,824
<font color="yellow">They never had to go through any hardships.</font>

430
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:05,594
<font color="yellow">There's nothing in the refrigerator. I bet they eat ramyeon everyday.</font>

431
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:07,694

432
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:10,324
<font color="yellow">What brother-in-law? He's not your family.</font>

433
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:11,854
<font color="yellow">He's still my brother-in-law.</font>

434
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,894
<font color="yellow">That's only when he was around.</font>

435
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:17,154
<font color="yellow">He changed. He even yelled at me.</font>

436

<font color="yellow">I don't understand what happened to him.</font>

437
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:23,524
<font color="yellow">That's why men should meet good women.</font>

<font color="yellow">Nothing good happened to him after meeting Gab Soon's sister.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why do I have to be the one to text you first?</font>

458
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,894
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to keep your mouth shut?</font>

459
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,954
<font color="yellow">You haven't texted nor called me since yesterday.</font>

460
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,654
<font color="yellow">Are you making me frustrated on purpose?</font>

461
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:32,354
<font color="yellow">No matter how it might end, we need to deal with it in person.</font>

462
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:35,024
<font color="yellow">You should know how to deal with an upset woman.</font>

463
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,424
<font color="yellow">What kind of a man are you?</font>

464
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:39,294
<font color="yellow">I don't have experience in that area. I don't know how to do that.</font>

465
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:41,524
<font color="yellow">Why don't you give it a try then? That's not something to be proud of.</font>

466
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:42,954
<font color="yellow">I was going to visit you after work.</font>

467
00:32:43,054 --> 00:32:44,754
<font color="yellow">I would've gone crazy before then.</font>

468
00:32:44,854 --> 00:32:46,624
<font color="yellow">I don't like fighting. I'm not good at that.</font>

469
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:48,624
<font color="yellow">Me neither. I'm not a fighter, either.</font>

470
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:50,394
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

471
00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:53,754
<font color="yellow">I tend to stutter and say stupid things...</font>

472
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:57,354
<font color="yellow">when a woman talks fast and starts arguing with me.</font>

473
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:01,954
<font color="yellow">- Was I talking fast? - It's becoming faster these days.</font>

474
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,554
<font color="yellow">I try hard not to act like this.</font>

475
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,624
<font color="yellow">But I don't know why we keep having trouble.</font>

476
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,754
<font color="yellow">I don't know why this keeps happening.</font>

477
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:14,224
<font color="yellow">We promised to start fresh by acting like we didn't have children.</font>

478
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:17,124
<font color="yellow">But things like this keep happening, so it's frustrating.</font>

479
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:18,294
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

480
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:21,124
<font color="yellow">Just saying sorry isn't enough. We should find a solution.</font>

481
00:33:21,794 --> 00:33:24,254
<font color="yellow">We agreed to figure things out together.</font>

482
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:26,954
<font color="yellow">But your ex-wife's families keep showing up.</font>

483
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:28,194
<font color="yellow">This is absurd.</font>

484
00:33:28,294 --> 00:33:30,424
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with my will.</font>

485
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,054
<font color="yellow">I heard she even went to see Cho Rong at her piano academy.</font>

486
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:35,554
<font color="yellow">We already had an argument. I told her never to show up again.</font>

487
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:37,194
<font color="yellow">Did you meet her again?</font>

488
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:39,824
<font color="yellow">No, I just bumped into her on my way home.</font>

489
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:43,624
<font color="yellow">I was feeling down, so I didn't have the energy to console you.</font>

490
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:47,124
<font color="yellow">Let me explain about what happened last time.</font>

491
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,554
<font color="yellow">It's true that I met Ddol Ee's father.</font>

492
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:53,824
<font color="yellow">But I met him only because of Ddol Ee.</font>

493
00:33:54,254 --> 00:33:57,224
<font color="yellow">You know what it's like. It's because of the kids.</font>

494
00:33:57,524 --> 00:33:58,554
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

495
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:00,554
<font color="yellow">Still, I was upset.</font>

496
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:03,854
<font color="yellow">I could also understand how you must have felt.</font>

497
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:07,094
<font color="yellow">It serves you right. You should know what it feels like.</font>

498
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:08,454
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

499
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:12,394
<font color="yellow">You learn a lesson only through your own experience. Especially men.</font>

500
00:34:13,324 --> 00:34:15,624
<font color="yellow">Be honest with me. Why did you say you wanted to break up?</font>

501
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:18,524
<font color="yellow">I thought you were seeing Ddol Ee's father again.</font>

502
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:23,194
<font color="yellow">So that's why you threw me a present and broke up with me?</font>

503
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,064
<font color="yellow">So that's why you came and woke me up in the middle of the night?</font>

504
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:29,094
<font color="yellow">I'm probably the only person in Korea who woke up...</font>

505
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,024
<font color="yellow">in the middle of the night only to be scolded in pyjamas.</font>

506
00:34:31,454 --> 00:34:32,724
<font color="yellow">Didn't you feel sorry for me?</font>

507
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:35,424
<font color="yellow">I was half awake and shivering in my pyjamas.</font>

508
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:37,424
<font color="yellow">Did you feel better after that?</font>

509
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:39,994
<font color="yellow">That's why I brought you some kimchi.</font>

510
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:42,624
<font color="yellow">My family even called me a thief because of that.</font>

511
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:46,024
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm the one at fault.</font>

512
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:01,894
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, let's go this way.</font>

513
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:05,524
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, did you have fun today?</font>

514
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:08,794
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - You two look like twins.</font>

515
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:11,724
<font color="yellow">Of course they do. They're father and son.</font>

516
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,394
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee has grown up a lot.</font>

517
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:17,224
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, you must have had a lot of fun today.</font>

518
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:19,564
<font color="yellow">We want to play with him,</font>

519
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:21,494
<font color="yellow">but we don't have enough energy.</font>

520
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:25,294
<font color="yellow">Once, I became really sick after playing with him.</font>

521
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:28,724
<font color="yellow">That's when Ddol Ee was going to the hospital.</font>

522
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:32,894
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't have had to go if he grew up with his dad.</font>

523
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:35,794
<font color="yellow">- He went a hospital? - What?</font>

524
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:38,694
<font color="yellow">Was Ddol Ee sick?</font>

525
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:40,154
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

526
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:42,154
<font color="yellow">He just had a cold.</font>

527
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:44,254
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was just a cold.</font>

528
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,294
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee was sick from a cold.</font>

529
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,024
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no. - Mum.</font>

530
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:54,194
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, did you have fun?</font>

531
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:55,654
<font color="yellow">I'm so excited.</font>

532
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,254
<font color="yellow">I played basketball and rode a bicycle with Dad.</font>

533
00:35:58,524 --> 00:35:59,524
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

534
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:02,794
<font color="yellow">Just quit your job at the supermarket.</font>

535
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,754
<font color="yellow">Just take care of Ddol Ee at home.</font>

536
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:08,494
<font color="yellow">He's right. You don't even earn that much. He's telling you to quit.</font>

537
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:10,154
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

538
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:11,624
<font color="yellow">Come on. Look.</font>

539
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:14,424
<font color="yellow">Don't they look like twins?</font>

540
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:15,854
<font color="yellow">It's so cheesy.</font>

541
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,194
<font color="yellow">I don't like matching clothes.</font>

542
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:20,254
<font color="yellow">It looks nice to me.</font>

543
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:22,724
<font color="yellow">Mum, I fell down today while riding the bicycle.</font>

544
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:24,324
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

545
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:26,594
<font color="yellow">What if he got hurt?</font>

546
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:29,824
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. That's how boys grow up.</font>

547
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:31,224
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry.</font>

548
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:34,224
<font color="yellow">- Dad, let's go ride it again. - Of course we will.</font>

549
00:36:34,954 --> 00:36:37,254
<font color="yellow">When you grow up, I'll teach you how to drive a car.</font>

550
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:40,564
<font color="yellow">- I'm so excited! - Of course, you are.</font>

551
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,594
<font color="yellow">My gosh, he looks happy.</font>

552
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:49,524
<font color="yellow">I didn't earn much today. It's 60 dollars.</font>

553
00:36:50,894 --> 00:36:53,094
<font color="yellow">- You're annoying. - Last time,</font>

554
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:55,924
<font color="yellow">I had 99,220 dollars left.</font>

555
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:59,064
<font color="yellow">Since I gave you 60 dollars today, I'll minus that amount.</font>

556
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:01,064
<font color="yellow">That's 99,860 dollars now.</font>

557
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:03,354
<font color="yellow">Until when do I have to see you like this?</font>

558
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,564
<font color="yellow">Until I pay the whole 100,000 dollars back.</font>

559
00:37:08,654 --> 00:37:10,154
<font color="yellow">Share this with your nieces.</font>

560
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,994
<font color="yellow">It looked delicious, so I bought some.</font>

561
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,224
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - It's bungeoppang.</font>

562
00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:18,494
<font color="yellow">- It's still warm. - I don't need it.</font>

563
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:34,594
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you know where Dal Pa goes every night?</font>

564
00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:37,254
<font color="yellow">I don't know. He just told me that he was going to visit someone.</font>

565
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:39,794
<font color="yellow">You should've convinced him to come home.</font>

566
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,894
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa is going to throw a fit if he sees you again. Go to your room.</font>

567
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:45,754
<font color="yellow">There he is.</font>

568
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:49,294
<font color="yellow">Where have you been? I got scolded because of you.</font>

569
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:51,524
<font color="yellow">Aunt Nae Shim.</font>

570
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:53,524
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

571
00:37:53,924 --> 00:37:55,854
<font color="yellow">You didn't need to. Thank you.</font>

572
00:37:56,194 --> 00:37:57,324
<font color="yellow">It's cold outside, isn't it?</font>

573
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,254
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hungry?</font>

574
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:01,594
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me. Don't even look at me.</font>

575
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:02,994
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

576
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:05,754
<font color="yellow">She's your mother.</font>

577
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:07,994
<font color="yellow">How could you talk like that to your own mother?</font>

578
00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:10,924
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here? Everyone, just go to sleep.</font>

579
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:13,024
<font color="yellow">She's your mother no matter what.</font>

580
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,154
<font color="yellow">She just made a mistake.</font>

581
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,824
<font color="yellow">You can't use that against her to treat her like that.</font>

582
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:19,524
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel bad for her?</font>

583
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:20,924
<font color="yellow">A mistake?</font>

584
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:22,954
<font color="yellow">How could you call that a mistake?</font>

585
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:25,694
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what she did to me?</font>

586
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,754
<font color="yellow">Hey. Dal Pa!</font>

587
00:38:34,294 --> 00:38:36,154
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

588
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:39,124
<font color="yellow">He finally came home. Why did you push him away?</font>

589
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:41,454
<font color="yellow">It's so cold outside. He has nowhere to stay!</font>

590
00:38:41,564 --> 00:38:44,224
<font color="yellow">You made a mistake, but you're still his mother.</font>

591
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:46,954
<font color="yellow">If only good parents were considered to be parents,</font>

592
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,254
<font color="yellow">not many people can be treated as parents in this world.</font>

593
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,494
<font color="yellow">The only reason why he comes here is because his mother is here.</font>

594
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:04,594
<font color="yellow">It seems like your dad...</font>

595
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:08,754
<font color="yellow">feels bad about his sister, but I don't feel like that at all.</font>

596
00:39:09,354 --> 00:39:10,994
<font color="yellow">You get what you deserve.</font>

597
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:12,694
<font color="yellow">Why did she do that?</font>

598
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:14,254
<font color="yellow">I have no idea.</font>

599
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:16,854
<font color="yellow">She always says...</font>

600
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:20,124
<font color="yellow">that she's living proof.</font>

601
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:22,994
<font color="yellow">She's the one who made all that proof.</font>

602
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:27,124
<font color="yellow">Whoever you are, you shouldn't do something you'll regret later.</font>

603
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:30,564
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Dal Pa. He's always intimidated at home.</font>

604
00:39:30,854 --> 00:39:33,024
<font color="yellow">It's because he used to live with us ever since he was little.</font>

605
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:35,154
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with living with us?</font>

606
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:37,894
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who had a hard time because of the mother and son.</font>

607
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:41,594
<font color="yellow">I think he cares about you, though. He buys snacks for you like this.</font>

608
00:39:41,854 --> 00:39:44,654
<font color="yellow">It must be because I took care of him...</font>

609
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:47,324
<font color="yellow">whenever his mum left him when he was young.</font>

610
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,254
<font color="yellow">If he's not grateful for that, that'd be nonsense.</font>

611
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:52,494
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

612
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:56,294
<font color="yellow">I feel like there's some dirt inside.</font>

613
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,024
<font color="yellow">- Me, too. - Me, too.</font>

614
00:39:58,324 --> 00:39:59,654
<font color="yellow">I kept tasting dirt.</font>

615
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:01,894
<font color="yellow">Do you think he brought home what was thrown away?</font>

616
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:05,624
<font color="yellow">Somehow, I always find something strange in my food these days.</font>

617
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:26,254
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - I'm asking just to be sure.</font>

618
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,794
<font color="yellow">Is Jae Soon seeing her ex-husband?</font>

619
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:31,154
<font color="yellow">But you're her ex-husband.</font>

620
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:33,694
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about me. I meant the second husband.</font>

621
00:40:33,954 --> 00:40:37,294
<font color="yellow">It's all set now. They even took care of the documents.</font>

622
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,154
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask all of a sudden?</font>

623
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:45,494
<font color="yellow">She has to meet you because you two have a kid,</font>

624
00:40:45,494 --> 00:40:48,894
<font color="yellow">but there's no reason for them to meet.</font>

625
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:50,454
<font color="yellow">It's nonsense.</font>

626
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:52,724
<font color="yellow">They got divorced because Jae Soon didn't like him.</font>

627
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:54,124
<font color="yellow">Are you sure she wasn't kicked out?</font>

628
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:56,794
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

629
00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:59,024
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon was the one who left him.</font>

630
00:40:59,954 --> 00:41:03,524
<font color="yellow">He was the one who cried and tried to get her back.</font>

631
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:06,754
<font color="yellow">It seems like he keeps trying to reach her even now.</font>

632
00:41:06,954 --> 00:41:08,524
<font color="yellow">What kind of person is he?</font>

633
00:41:08,654 --> 00:41:11,124
<font color="yellow">He used to own a quite successful business,</font>

634
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:13,924
<font color="yellow">but it looks like he's some kind of a salesperson these days.</font>

635
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:16,294
<font color="yellow">He's not wealthy at all.</font>

636
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:19,094
<font color="yellow">He's not even comparable to you. You don't need to worry.</font>

637
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,154
<font color="yellow">I'm not the type to worry.</font>

638
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:24,424
<font color="yellow">Good. I'll make some bibim guksu for you. Have some before you leave.</font>

639
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:26,064
<font color="yellow">Your father-in-law isn't home.</font>

640
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:29,994
<font color="yellow">Thank you, but I have a business meeting. Maybe next time.</font>

641
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:33,994
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

642
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:36,294
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - I think Se Bang...</font>

643
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,754
<font color="yellow">saw you meeting Geum Sik.</font>

644
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:39,254
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

645
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:42,324
<font color="yellow">You talk as if I did something unfaithful behind my husband's back.</font>

646
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:43,564
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

647
00:41:43,624 --> 00:41:45,424
<font color="yellow">Please think of Ddol Ee.</font>

648
00:42:05,394 --> 00:42:06,494
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, look over here.</font>

649
00:42:07,654 --> 00:42:09,424
<font color="yellow">Dad, play with me.</font>

650
00:42:15,524 --> 00:42:17,064
<font color="yellow">He's a carbon copy of me, right?</font>

651
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:33,394
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you straightforwardly.</font>

652
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,624
<font color="yellow">Who is it that's dragging this on?</font>

653
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:37,354
<font color="yellow">Tell us.</font>

654
00:42:37,894 --> 00:42:39,594
<font color="yellow">Who is the one that won't let go?</font>

655
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:41,564
<font color="yellow">It must be Gab Soon.</font>

656
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:45,994
<font color="yellow">It's Gab Soon who won't let go of Gab Dol.</font>

657
00:42:46,324 --> 00:42:48,794
<font color="yellow">- She's right. - Can't you do without him?</font>

658
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:51,124
<font color="yellow">She dated him for 10 years. Of course she can't do without him.</font>

659
00:42:51,824 --> 00:42:53,794
<font color="yellow">Whatever my reason is,</font>

660
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:55,624
<font color="yellow">I won't let him go for my own sake.</font>

661
00:42:55,894 --> 00:42:57,794
<font color="yellow">Where else can I find someone like Gab Dol?</font>

662
00:42:57,994 --> 00:42:59,924
<font color="yellow">He's the best husband material since he's a public official.</font>

663
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:02,524
<font color="yellow">On top of that, he's handsome and healthy.</font>

664
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,694
<font color="yellow">I trained him for 10 years. I won't let someone else take him.</font>

665
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:07,894
<font color="yellow">How do I know if my business will last or not?</font>

666
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:10,754
<font color="yellow">If I have a public official as a husband,</font>

667
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,094
<font color="yellow">I would have an insurance. Why would I let that go?</font>

668
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:15,654
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because I've thought about it.</font>

669
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,324
<font color="yellow">I'm not stupid, Dad.</font>

670
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:20,624
<font color="yellow">I'm not dumb, Mum.</font>

671
00:43:20,854 --> 00:43:22,524
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll all understand.</font>

672
00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:31,454
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

673
00:43:32,024 --> 00:43:35,694
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do about Gab Soon? Can you talk to her?</font>

674
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:38,564
<font color="yellow">- She listens to you. - All right.</font>

675
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:42,124
<font color="yellow">I was going to meet with Jae Soon to talk anyway.</font>

676
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:51,754
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

677
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:53,394
<font color="yellow">It's a date.</font>

678
00:43:54,654 --> 00:43:56,494
<font color="yellow">How did you know I like younger men?</font>

679
00:43:57,024 --> 00:44:00,294
<font color="yellow">I like older women, but you're not my type.</font>

680
00:44:02,254 --> 00:44:03,824
<font color="yellow">It's hard to work at the supermarket, right?</font>

681
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:08,024
<font color="yellow">The work isn't hard, but the overall situation is.</font>

682
00:44:08,394 --> 00:44:09,454
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Se Bang?</font>

683
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:11,994
<font color="yellow">I don't want to discuss this with my brother.</font>

684
00:44:12,454 --> 00:44:13,654
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

685
00:44:14,424 --> 00:44:17,194
<font color="yellow">Call me whenever you're down. We'll go for drinks.</font>

686
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:21,554
<font color="yellow">I heard Gab Soon and Gab Dol want to get married.</font>

687
00:44:22,194 --> 00:44:25,394
<font color="yellow">The family's against it, but she's adamant.</font>

688
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:29,394
<font color="yellow">I called them here so we can talk.</font>

689
00:44:31,124 --> 00:44:33,354
<font color="yellow">Se Gye. Jae Soon, you're here, too?</font>

690
00:44:35,224 --> 00:44:36,224
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

691
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:37,894
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

692
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:45,724
<font color="yellow">- I heard you're getting married. - Yes.</font>

693
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:48,694
<font color="yellow">Both of your parents are against it. Do you think it'll work?</font>

694
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:50,024
<font color="yellow">We'll make it work.</font>

695
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:52,654
<font color="yellow">Do you agree with her?</font>

696
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:54,794
<font color="yellow">Yes. Well...</font>

697
00:44:55,594 --> 00:44:59,054
<font color="yellow">You dated for 10 years. It's about time you got married.</font>

698
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:00,594
<font color="yellow">It's been 11 years.</font>

699
00:45:00,854 --> 00:45:02,824
<font color="yellow">Are you prepared for the wedding?</font>

700
00:45:03,824 --> 00:45:05,024
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

701
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:06,394
<font color="yellow">What about a place?</font>

702
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:08,454
<font color="yellow">Where will you live?</font>

703
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:12,894
<font color="yellow">Of course they don't have a place to live.</font>

704
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:16,554
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol. How much have you saved up?</font>

705
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:18,824
<font color="yellow">It's been just a few months since I got hired.</font>

706
00:45:19,794 --> 00:45:22,024
<font color="yellow">What about you, Gab Soon?</font>

707
00:45:22,354 --> 00:45:23,824
<font color="yellow">I'm not much different.</font>

708
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,624
<font color="yellow">I only got to start my business thanks to the investment.</font>

709
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,454
<font color="yellow">Of course they don't have anything.</font>

710
00:45:29,454 --> 00:45:31,054
<font color="yellow">They were jobless for a while.</font>

711
00:45:31,324 --> 00:45:32,394
<font color="yellow">It's not a surprise.</font>

712
00:45:32,594 --> 00:45:35,954
<font color="yellow">How will you get married when you don't have money for a place?</font>

713
00:45:36,894 --> 00:45:38,654
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, can your family help?</font>

714
00:45:39,224 --> 00:45:41,054
<font color="yellow">- No. - What about you?</font>

715
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:44,194
<font color="yellow">Don't bother asking. You're wasting your time.</font>

716
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:45,794
<font color="yellow">Are you going to help us?</font>

717
00:45:46,124 --> 00:45:47,324
<font color="yellow">Don't mind him.</font>

718
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:52,394
<font color="yellow">I want to help, but I don't have that much.</font>

719
00:45:53,494 --> 00:45:55,724
<font color="yellow">You can't even afford a place to live in.</font>

720
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:58,454
<font color="yellow">Wanting to get married won't solve anything.</font>

721
00:45:59,194 --> 00:46:02,194
<font color="yellow">You should prepare yourselves and make a plan...</font>

722
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:04,054
<font color="yellow">before you tell your parents.</font>

723
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:06,324
<font color="yellow">Getting married costs a lot.</font>

724
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:08,354
<font color="yellow">You have to prepare wedding gifts, too.</font>

725
00:46:08,554 --> 00:46:11,894
<font color="yellow">You can't just force a wedding to happen...</font>

726
00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:13,994
<font color="yellow">without preparing anything.</font>

727
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:16,124
<font color="yellow">I would've been against it too if I were your parents.</font>

728
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:19,354
<font color="yellow">They're still so immature. It's all just talk.</font>

729
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,224
<font color="yellow">There's no need to listen. My ears hurt.</font>

730
00:46:22,494 --> 00:46:23,694
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Se Gye.</font>

731
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:31,024
<font color="yellow">What Se Gye said is true.</font>

732
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:34,694
<font color="yellow">We'll start off from a rental place.</font>

733
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:38,294
<font color="yellow">- Rent? - Don't forget our circumstances.</font>

734
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:42,494
<font color="yellow">I gave up on living a wealthy life when I decided to marry you.</font>

735
00:46:43,194 --> 00:46:45,154
<font color="yellow">Whenever I imagined marrying you,</font>

736
00:46:45,154 --> 00:46:47,754
<font color="yellow">I pictured living in the extra room or your room at your house.</font>

737
00:46:48,394 --> 00:46:51,224
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, I've never dreamt of anything better than that.</font>

738
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:54,224
<font color="yellow">Can't we delay the date?</font>

739
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:56,594
<font color="yellow">Why? I don't want to move it to next year.</font>

740
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:59,094
<font color="yellow">We were going to do it last year. We should do it this spring.</font>

741
00:46:59,394 --> 00:47:00,454
<font color="yellow">That fast?</font>

742
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:02,394
<font color="yellow">Spring is too soon.</font>

743
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:04,324
<font color="yellow">How about fall?</font>

744
00:47:04,524 --> 00:47:06,424
<font color="yellow">Let's get it over with while we're passionate.</font>

745
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:08,894
<font color="yellow">If we get lukewarm, it'll be over.</font>

746
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:10,494
<font color="yellow">Just follow my lead.</font>

747
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:14,294
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

748
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,724
<font color="yellow">I want to get married right now, too.</font>

749
00:47:18,554 --> 00:47:20,894
<font color="yellow">However, there's our family and the house.</font>

750
00:47:21,294 --> 00:47:22,424
<font color="yellow">My mum is sick.</font>

751
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:25,524
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, let's make it autumn.</font>

752
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:27,394
<font color="yellow">That's so far away.</font>

753
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:29,554
<font color="yellow">But I promise to prepare everything by then.</font>

754
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:33,424
<font color="yellow">I'll get Mum's permission and find us a nice place to live.</font>

755
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:35,394
<font color="yellow">Like Se Gye said,</font>

756
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,994
<font color="yellow">how can I marry you without a place to live in?</font>

757
00:47:38,824 --> 00:47:41,794
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is marry me. I'll prepare everything.</font>

758
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:43,654
<font color="yellow">Let's make it autumn, okay?</font>

759
00:47:46,854 --> 00:47:49,154
<font color="yellow">- Did you call me? - Come sit here.</font>

760
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:58,094
<font color="yellow">Work is tough, isn't it?</font>

761
00:47:58,824 --> 00:48:02,624
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were stressed while working with me.</font>

762
00:48:03,224 --> 00:48:06,354
<font color="yellow">On that note, what do you think about quitting?</font>

763
00:48:07,124 --> 00:48:09,794
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - This place isn't right for you.</font>

764
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,094
<font color="yellow">Someone else will be coming to replace you.</font>

765
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:14,424
<font color="yellow">Can't you go back to being a doctor?</font>

766
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:16,454
<font color="yellow">Your grandfather-in-law and I...</font>

767
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:18,394
<font color="yellow">liked you because you were a doctor.</font>

768
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:20,094
<font color="yellow">This isn't right.</font>

769
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:22,994
<font color="yellow">If you work as a doctor for three years,</font>

770
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:25,054
<font color="yellow">I'll help you open your clinic.</font>

771
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:28,724
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of my own matters.</font>

772
00:48:28,924 --> 00:48:30,594
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for your parents.</font>

773
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:32,924
<font color="yellow">How can they just watch their son do this?</font>

774
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:35,054
<font color="yellow">It's such a waste of your license.</font>

775
00:48:35,794 --> 00:48:37,854
<font color="yellow">Do your parents have an ulterior motive...</font>

776
00:48:38,154 --> 00:48:39,994
<font color="yellow">because of our family's wealth?</font>

777
00:48:41,124 --> 00:48:42,954
<font color="yellow">Please don't talk like that.</font>

778
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:44,954
<font color="yellow">I'll take everything else,</font>

779
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:47,854
<font color="yellow">but please do not talk bad about my family.</font>

780
00:48:49,024 --> 00:48:52,294
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'll take care of my business.</font>

781
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:54,594
<font color="yellow">Please do not worry.</font>

782
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:57,694
<font color="yellow">I repeat.</font>

783
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:00,424
<font color="yellow">I have no interest in this business.</font>

784
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:04,054
<font color="yellow">My parents have no interest in your wealth, either.</font>

785
00:49:04,254 --> 00:49:05,754
<font color="yellow">That's fine,</font>

786
00:49:06,054 --> 00:49:08,324
<font color="yellow">but that's no reason for you to glare at me.</font>

787
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:11,624
<font color="yellow">I'll excuse myself.</font>

788
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:25,254
<font color="yellow">I was about to go out. Did something happen?</font>

789
00:49:26,094 --> 00:49:27,254
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

790
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:28,894
<font color="yellow">I was just craving your cooking.</font>

791
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,754
<font color="yellow">I have to go out right now.</font>

792
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:32,224
<font color="yellow">It's okay, then.</font>

793
00:49:32,224 --> 00:49:35,254
<font color="yellow">There's cheonggukjang from earlier. Do you want to eat it?</font>

794
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:37,994
<font color="yellow">You should have ate out.</font>

795
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:41,094
<font color="yellow">You were too busy to eat when you were a doctor,</font>

796
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:43,024
<font color="yellow">but you have a lot of time now.</font>

797
00:49:43,254 --> 00:49:44,854
<font color="yellow">Why are you skipping meals?</font>

798
00:49:45,054 --> 00:49:47,094
<font color="yellow">There's so much good food out there.</font>

799
00:49:51,824 --> 00:49:53,694
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm on my way.</font>

800
00:49:58,124 --> 00:50:00,724
<font color="yellow">They won't appreciate you if you visit too often.</font>

801
00:50:01,154 --> 00:50:03,524
<font color="yellow">You should only show up time to time.</font>

802
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,124
<font color="yellow">Were you fired?</font>

803
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:10,024
<font color="yellow">Those in-laws' of yours are really tough on you.</font>

804
00:50:10,394 --> 00:50:11,994
<font color="yellow">Eat some food while you're here.</font>

805
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:21,254
<font color="yellow">I've never felt so useless...</font>

806
00:50:21,994 --> 00:50:24,124
<font color="yellow">in all my life.</font>

807
00:50:26,354 --> 00:50:28,354
<font color="yellow">I feel like the world doesn't need me.</font>

808
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:30,854
<font color="yellow">I feel empty...</font>

809
00:50:32,294 --> 00:50:33,694
<font color="yellow">and ashamed.</font>

810
00:50:36,694 --> 00:50:38,554
<font color="yellow">I didn't know I was this worthless.</font>

811
00:50:41,694 --> 00:50:43,924
<font color="yellow">I thought I could do anything if I wasn't a doctor.</font>

812
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:45,354
<font color="yellow">At least that's what I thought.</font>

813
00:50:46,694 --> 00:50:49,124
<font color="yellow">That's why I started working at the office.</font>

814
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:52,454
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

815
00:50:54,424 --> 00:50:55,724
<font color="yellow">I've lost my way now.</font>

816
00:50:58,824 --> 00:51:00,054
<font color="yellow">You're not like yourself.</font>

817
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:02,624
<font color="yellow">Don't think like that.</font>

818
00:51:03,324 --> 00:51:06,554
<font color="yellow">You're always logical and rational.</font>

819
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,954
<font color="yellow">You'll be able to find your way.</font>

820
00:51:11,524 --> 00:51:14,094
<font color="yellow">Is there something you're hiding from me?</font>

821
00:51:14,394 --> 00:51:15,794
<font color="yellow">Even if I tell you,</font>

822
00:51:16,624 --> 00:51:17,894
<font color="yellow">nothing will change.</font>

823
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:19,824
<font color="yellow">You can at least talk to me.</font>

824
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:22,324
<font color="yellow">(Gong Joo)</font>

825
00:51:25,224 --> 00:51:26,394
<font color="yellow">Let's just drink.</font>

826
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:37,854
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

827
00:51:37,924 --> 00:51:39,454
<font color="yellow">I'm Se Gye's wife.</font>

828
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:42,994
<font color="yellow">Are you with him right now? He's not picking up.</font>

829
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:46,224
<font color="yellow">I'm not with him right now.</font>

830
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:48,854
<font color="yellow">I'll hang up.</font>

831
00:51:51,754 --> 00:51:54,854
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why are you calling her?</font>

832
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:57,494
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.</font>

833
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,894
<font color="yellow">You're with her?</font>

834
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:02,554
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am. We're having a drink.</font>

835
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:05,524
<font color="yellow">If I don't pick up, then there must be a reason.</font>

836
00:52:05,824 --> 00:52:07,394
<font color="yellow">What are you suspecting?</font>

837
00:52:44,994 --> 00:52:47,624
<font color="yellow">- Does it hurt a lot? - You should go sleep.</font>

838
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:49,594
<font color="yellow">Let's see a doctor tomorrow.</font>

839
00:52:49,994 --> 00:52:53,794
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm sick after what you've done to me.</font>

840
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,994
<font color="yellow">I'll be good, so don't be sick.</font>

841
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:04,754
<font color="yellow">Come outside. I'm in front of your place.</font>

842
00:53:08,654 --> 00:53:10,694
<font color="yellow">I can't right now. I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

843
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,824
<font color="yellow">I'll wait until you come out.</font>

844
00:53:22,654 --> 00:53:24,594
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to go to the washroom again?</font>

845
00:53:37,354 --> 00:53:38,354
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

846
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:40,624
<font color="yellow">We dated for over 10 years, right?</font>

847
00:53:41,654 --> 00:53:44,224
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - We've known each other for 20.</font>

848
00:53:44,524 --> 00:53:46,154
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why?</font>

849
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:49,224
<font color="yellow">Then you must know by just looking into my eyes or hearing my voice.</font>

850
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:51,554
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

851
00:53:52,224 --> 00:53:53,894
<font color="yellow">I can tell everything about you.</font>

852
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:55,694
<font color="yellow">You're acting strange lately.</font>

853
00:53:56,124 --> 00:53:57,994
<font color="yellow">You don't call me or text me.</font>

854
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:02,854
<font color="yellow">I have an idea, but I want you to tell me honestly.</font>

855
00:54:03,354 --> 00:54:05,624
<font color="yellow">- It's not like that. - Don't make an excuse.</font>

856
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:08,794
<font color="yellow">I'm not mad. I just want to check, that's all.</font>

857
00:54:10,224 --> 00:54:11,494
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to change the date to autumn?</font>

858
00:54:11,954 --> 00:54:13,994
<font color="yellow">- There are several reasons... - Forget it.</font>

859
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:17,194
<font color="yellow">Just pick. Is it me or your mum?</font>

860
00:54:18,624 --> 00:54:19,924
<font color="yellow">She's sick right now.</font>

861
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:22,294
<font color="yellow">Answer me. Is it me or your mum?</font>

862
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:23,894
<font color="yellow">What kind of question is that?</font>

863
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,724
<font color="yellow">I said, answer me. Is it me or your mum?</font>

864
00:54:33,024 --> 00:54:34,054
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

865
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,254
<font color="yellow">I heard your answer.</font>

866
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:50,394
<font color="yellow">I won't get married.</font>

867
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:54,224
<font color="yellow">What is she saying?</font>

868
00:54:55,154 --> 00:54:56,494
<font color="yellow">She won't get married.</font>

869
00:54:57,354 --> 00:55:00,024
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes. I won't get married.</font>

870
00:55:00,554 --> 00:55:03,324
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about what happened. I won't take questions.</font>

871
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:09,694
<font color="yellow">That's good news, but what happened to her?</font>

872
00:55:10,024 --> 00:55:12,254
<font color="yellow">Does she think this is a press conference?</font>

873
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:15,024
<font color="yellow">She just announced what she wants and declined to take questions.</font>

874
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,794
<font color="yellow">Se Gye and I met with them and scolded them.</font>

875
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:19,294
<font color="yellow">It must have got to them.</font>

876
00:55:19,554 --> 00:55:23,054
<font color="yellow">In any case, I'm happy. They were being so arrogant.</font>

877
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:24,494
<font color="yellow">It worked out.</font>

878
00:55:28,254 --> 00:55:29,524
<font color="yellow">It's cold. Why are you outside?</font>

879
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,424
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep.</font>

880
00:55:33,094 --> 00:55:36,294
<font color="yellow">I heard you met your biological mother.</font>

881
00:55:37,554 --> 00:55:39,494
<font color="yellow">I only heard of such stories on dramas.</font>

882
00:55:41,924 --> 00:55:43,694
<font color="yellow">You must have a lot on your mind.</font>

883
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:47,094
<font color="yellow">Why did she leave you?</font>

884
00:55:47,524 --> 00:55:48,694
<font color="yellow">I didn't even ask.</font>

885
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:52,524
<font color="yellow">It's obvious. She probably left me to have a better life.</font>

886
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:55,054
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about it.</font>

887
00:55:57,294 --> 00:55:59,824
<font color="yellow">How is it going with Gab Soon? I heard you're getting married.</font>

888
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,154
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - I'm so stupid.</font>

889
00:56:05,024 --> 00:56:06,894
<font color="yellow">I can't get anything right.</font>

890
00:56:07,424 --> 00:56:08,694
<font color="yellow">You're not stupid.</font>

891
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:11,594
<font color="yellow">I'm most jealous of you in this world.</font>

892
00:56:12,894 --> 00:56:14,894
<font color="yellow">You talked about love one time.</font>

893
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:18,554
<font color="yellow">You said nothing matters in the world without her.</font>

894
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:23,024
<font color="yellow">You don't want to eat, and you can't laugh.</font>

895
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:25,624
<font color="yellow">You said everything just comes to a halt.</font>

896
00:56:26,654 --> 00:56:28,224
<font color="yellow">You're know better about love than I do,</font>

897
00:56:28,894 --> 00:56:30,194
<font color="yellow">but I know one thing.</font>

898
00:56:31,424 --> 00:56:32,524
<font color="yellow">Love...</font>

899
00:56:33,654 --> 00:56:35,294
<font color="yellow">doesn't just come to you.</font>

900
00:56:57,894 --> 00:57:00,224
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm sorry.</font>

901
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:40,824
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

902
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:43,024
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon told us it's over.</font>

903
00:57:43,324 --> 00:57:44,354
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

904
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:46,694
<font color="yellow">I came to ask for your permission.</font>

905
00:57:47,324 --> 00:57:49,354
<font color="yellow">Father, Mother, please give us permission.</font>

906
00:57:49,824 --> 00:57:53,354
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Get your family's permission first.</font>

907
00:57:53,654 --> 00:57:55,894
<font color="yellow">We'll consider it then.</font>

908
00:57:56,294 --> 00:57:57,354
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

909
00:57:57,624 --> 00:58:00,024
<font color="yellow">Don't ask him when we're not giving him food.</font>

910
00:58:00,554 --> 00:58:02,454
<font color="yellow">Go. Don't just sit there.</font>

911
00:58:02,924 --> 00:58:07,254
<font color="yellow">How did you visit just in time for a meal?</font>

912
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:09,594
<font color="yellow">Father, please give us your permission.</font>

913
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:12,394
<font color="yellow">I already said what I have to say when I saw you last time.</font>

914
00:58:12,854 --> 00:58:14,794
<font color="yellow">- Get me more soup. - Okay.</font>

915
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:19,694
<font color="yellow">This year's kimchi is really good.</font>

916
00:58:20,324 --> 00:58:21,994
<font color="yellow">The cabbage was good.</font>

917
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,994
<font color="yellow">That's because I grew them.</font>

918
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:28,394
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Don't talk to me when I'm eating.</font>

919
00:58:29,294 --> 00:58:31,354
<font color="yellow">What don't you understand?</font>

920
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:35,124
<font color="yellow">You should listen to your elders. Are you ignoring me?</font>

921
00:58:36,254 --> 00:58:38,194
<font color="yellow">I won't move until you give me your permission.</font>

922
00:58:38,394 --> 00:58:40,854
<font color="yellow">Do as you wish. I don't care.</font>

923
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,154
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

924
00:58:46,324 --> 00:58:47,794
<font color="yellow">It tastes good.</font>

925
00:59:05,394 --> 00:59:07,654
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, Gab Dol is at home.</font>

926
00:59:07,854 --> 00:59:09,794
<font color="yellow">Why is he there? Send him away.</font>

927
00:59:10,054 --> 00:59:11,924
<font color="yellow">I think you have to come.</font>

928
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:14,054
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

929
00:59:21,994 --> 00:59:23,654
<font color="yellow">- The soup is so good. - It's good.</font>

930
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:25,694
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

931
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:28,394
<font color="yellow">It's so good.</font>

932
01:00:05,454 --> 01:00:06,954
<font color="yellow">Are you Jo Geum Man?</font>

933
01:00:07,224 --> 01:00:08,994
<font color="yellow">No. It's Jo Geum Sik.</font>

934
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:18,124
<font color="yellow">You should go. I don't think today is the day.</font>

935
01:00:18,394 --> 01:00:19,454
<font color="yellow">I won't go.</font>

936
01:00:19,754 --> 01:00:21,694
<font color="yellow">Doing this won't help.</font>

937
01:00:21,924 --> 01:00:23,424
<font color="yellow">We already told you.</font>

938
01:00:24,094 --> 01:00:26,294
<font color="yellow">Get your mother's permission first.</font>

939
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:29,524
<font color="yellow">If you give us your permission, we'll get married regardless.</font>

940
01:00:29,724 --> 01:00:30,854
<font color="yellow">You must be crazy.</font>

941
01:00:31,724 --> 01:00:34,454
<font color="yellow">You must you look down on our family.</font>

942
01:00:35,794 --> 01:00:39,024
<font color="yellow">Being stubborn won't help. It's not the right order.</font>

943
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:43,054
<font color="yellow">In this situation, you must get your mother's permission first.</font>

944
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:47,824
<font color="yellow">You should come to beg or do whatever else afterwards.</font>

945
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,254
<font color="yellow">What you're doing doesn't make sense.</font>

946
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:52,854
<font color="yellow">Don't you know any better?</font>

947
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:55,854
<font color="yellow">- Leave. - Father.</font>

948
01:00:56,394 --> 01:00:58,554
<font color="yellow">You heard him, right? You should go.</font>

949
01:00:58,924 --> 01:01:00,054
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

950
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:02,424
<font color="yellow">Please, Mother.</font>

951
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:04,924
<font color="yellow">We'll get married no matter what my family says.</font>

952
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,054
<font color="yellow">You're going to live without seeing your mother?</font>

953
01:01:07,324 --> 01:01:08,854
<font color="yellow">Can you do that?</font>

954
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:13,054
<font color="yellow">- I won't see her. - My goodness.</font>

955
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:16,554
<font color="yellow">Hello. Is this Gab Dol's mother?</font>

956
01:01:17,254 --> 01:01:19,824
<font color="yellow">- I'm Gab Soon's mum. - Mum.</font>

957
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:22,624
<font color="yellow">I'm Gab Soon's mum.</font>

958
01:01:23,094 --> 01:01:24,194
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

959
01:01:24,654 --> 01:01:26,924
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling me?</font>

960
01:01:27,724 --> 01:01:30,324
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you want to say to me,</font>

961
01:01:30,694 --> 01:01:31,994
<font color="yellow">but I don't want to hear it.</font>

962
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:34,324
<font color="yellow">You brat. You better listen to me.</font>

963
01:01:35,054 --> 01:01:37,124
<font color="yellow">Take your son away from here.</font>

964
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:38,724
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

965
01:01:38,724 --> 01:01:40,724
<font color="yellow">Your son has been kneeling down...</font>

966
01:01:40,794 --> 01:01:43,394
<font color="yellow">and begging us for our approval of their marriage.</font>

967
01:01:43,654 --> 01:01:45,754
<font color="yellow">I can't bear to watch it any more.</font>

968
01:01:46,094 --> 01:01:49,994
<font color="yellow">I can't beat him since he's not my son, so please get him out of here.</font>

969
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:00,794
<font color="yellow">Leave before your mother comes and cause a commotion.</font>

970
01:02:01,294 --> 01:02:02,754
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see her.</font>

971
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:04,224
<font color="yellow">I can't leave.</font>

972
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,754
<font color="yellow">It's better this way.</font>

973
01:02:06,194 --> 01:02:08,854
<font color="yellow">When she comes, I will settle it once and for all.</font>

974
01:02:18,794 --> 01:02:20,794
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

975
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:23,054
<font color="yellow">Can't you understand what I'm saying?</font>

976
01:02:23,394 --> 01:02:25,224
<font color="yellow">You should obey when your elders tell you to do something.</font>

977
01:02:25,594 --> 01:02:28,054
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's proper to sit there stubbornly?</font>

978
01:02:28,754 --> 01:02:31,224
<font color="yellow">Take these with you. I don't need this.</font>

979
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:38,694
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

980
01:02:39,294 --> 01:02:40,424
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

981
01:02:41,194 --> 01:02:43,794
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to throw it that hard.</font>

982
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:45,394
<font color="yellow">He's not even hurt.</font>

983
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:47,794
<font color="yellow">This is too much. I can't believe you did this.</font>

984
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:50,394
<font color="yellow">How can you treat him this way?</font>

985
01:02:50,654 --> 01:02:53,454
<font color="yellow">Do you expect his mum to treat me well when you're being like this?</font>

986
01:02:53,924 --> 01:02:57,824
<font color="yellow">Just as I'm precious to you, he is precious to his mother.</font>

987
01:02:58,254 --> 01:02:59,254
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

988
01:03:00,524 --> 01:03:01,724
<font color="yellow">Stand up!</font>

989
01:03:02,024 --> 01:03:04,024
<font color="yellow">He probably can't get up because his legs fell asleep.</font>

990
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:07,394
<font color="yellow">He's been kneeling down for two hours.</font>

991
01:03:07,654 --> 01:03:09,294
<font color="yellow">Stand up!</font>

992
01:03:23,224 --> 01:03:26,054
<font color="yellow">Why did you come by yourself?</font>

993
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:27,994
<font color="yellow">What did you expect?</font>

994
01:03:28,894 --> 01:03:30,494
<font color="yellow">You came to my house by yourself, too.</font>

995
01:03:30,754 --> 01:03:32,624
<font color="yellow">I can handle your mother.</font>

996
01:03:33,094 --> 01:03:35,094
<font color="yellow">But you can't handle my family.</font>

997
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:37,424
<font color="yellow">My family is a lot bigger.</font>

998
01:03:38,924 --> 01:03:40,294
<font color="yellow">Your legs must hurt a lot.</font>

999
01:03:42,754 --> 01:03:43,894
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

1000
01:03:44,724 --> 01:03:47,354
<font color="yellow">I feel so incompetent. I don't know what to do.</font>

1001
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:50,254
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

1002
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:54,624
<font color="yellow">I know how you feel now, so it's okay.</font>

1003
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,094
<font color="yellow">Let's give up...</font>

1004
01:03:58,294 --> 01:03:59,654
<font color="yellow">on trying to get married.</font>

1005
01:04:01,624 --> 01:04:02,694
<font color="yellow">You want to break up?</font>

1006
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:05,524
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam.</font>

1007
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:06,724
<font color="yellow">It's over there.</font>

1008
01:04:10,254 --> 01:04:13,254
<font color="yellow">Forget the marriage. Let's just live together.</font>

1009
01:04:14,424 --> 01:04:15,454
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

1010
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:17,224
<font color="yellow">Let's live together.</font>
