00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:16,873
<font color="yellow">She just left with her luggage. Didn't you see her leaving?</font>

00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:19,403
<font color="yellow">- What about Ddol Ee? - I'm sure she took him with her.</font>

5

6
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:24,403
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even talk to her because I was so scared.</font>

7
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:26,973

<font color="yellow">She has no money and nowhere to go.</font>

11
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:36,003

17

<font color="yellow">Yes, Uncle. I'm so sorry.</font>

18

<font color="yellow">Something just came up.</font>

20

<font color="yellow">I am too ashamed to face other relatives.</font>

21
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:09,143
<font color="yellow">I am truly sorry.</font>

22
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,273
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

23
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,743

25
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:19,473

26
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:22,173

<font color="yellow">After the beep, you will be charged.</font>

31
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:34,873
<font color="yellow">She turned it off.</font>

32
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:43,173
<font color="yellow">The mobile is turned off, so you will be forward to voice mail.</font>

34

35
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:48,943
<font color="yellow">She turned it off a while ago and won't answer.</font>

36
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,903

<font color="yellow">She has nowhere to go.</font>

38

39

00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:00,273
<font color="yellow">Tell me what it is.</font>

52
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,973
<font color="yellow">Do we have to go to the US?</font>

53
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:05,673
<font color="yellow">Can we not go there?</font>

54
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:07,673
<font color="yellow">How can you say that now that we're here?</font>

55
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:09,343
<font color="yellow">You agreed to go. Why are you saying this all of a sudden?</font>

56

<font color="yellow">Ms Shin was supposed to get married today.</font>

57

61
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:35,473
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

62
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:38,643
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

63
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:50,303
<font color="yellow">- This is exciting. - Isn't it?</font>

64
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:52,173

67
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:58,003
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about getting upset earlier.</font>

68
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:07,273

<font color="yellow">Daddy, it's my stomach.</font>

72
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,173
<font color="yellow">Your stomach hurts? How does it hurt?</font>

73
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:21,843

89
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:07,203
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

90
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,273
<font color="yellow">What a relief. I was so worried.</font>

91
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,203
<font color="yellow">Since you're here anyway, let's get a checkup.</font>

92
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,313
<font color="yellow">No, I don't need to. I'm totally fine.</font>

93
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:16,373
<font color="yellow">You were acting because you don't want to go, weren't you?</font>

94
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:18,503
<font color="yellow">I was really sick at the moment.</font>

95

96
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:24,043
<font color="yellow">- What should we do now? - We should buy new tickets.</font>

97
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:25,443
<font color="yellow">Let's stay at a hotel tonight.</font>

98
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,603
<font color="yellow">I know you didn't want to go to the US so much.</font>

99
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,973
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you weren't acting?</font>

100
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:31,203
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik, we're going to the US for sure, right?</font>

101
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,803
<font color="yellow">Of course, we are. It's about my work.</font>

102
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:35,603
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to the hotel and go to the office.</font>

103
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:38,403
<font color="yellow">I need to email the US branch. Let's go.</font>

104
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:49,343
<font color="yellow">Sir, didn't you go to the US?</font>

105
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,803
<font color="yellow">I missed the flight. I should leave within this week.</font>

106
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:53,973
<font color="yellow">Then could you help me?</font>

107
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,343
<font color="yellow">- This could be a big problem. - What is it?</font>

108
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,403
<font color="yellow">It's about the home shopping you're in charge of.</font>

109
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:00,943
<font color="yellow">Actually, I've never dealt with home shopping before,</font>

110
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:03,903
<font color="yellow">and I made a big mistake.</font>

111
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:06,273
<font color="yellow">What? What kind of mistake?</font>

112
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:08,743
<font color="yellow">I sent the wrong number of supplies to the factory.</font>

113
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:11,903
<font color="yellow">It seems like it'd be hard for the factory to meet the deadline.</font>

114
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:14,303
<font color="yellow">We need to have another meeting with the home shopping company,</font>

115
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:16,243
<font color="yellow">but I don't know what to do first.</font>

116
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,603
<font color="yellow">The deadline is soon, isn't it?</font>

117
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,273
<font color="yellow">It's tomorrow.</font>

118
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:23,243
<font color="yellow">This just suddenly happened. It makes me crazy.</font>

119
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:25,643
<font color="yellow">Let's go. You drive the car.</font>

120
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,503
<font color="yellow">Take some medicine and have some sleep.</font>

121
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,473
<font color="yellow">I'm worried you'll get into trouble as well.</font>

122
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:38,473
<font color="yellow">I don't even know if she's dead or alive. I can't hear from her.</font>

123
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:41,073
<font color="yellow">She's not going to die. Don't worry.</font>

124
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:45,003
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have money, and she's out with a kid on such a cold day.</font>

125
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,573
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

126
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,843
<font color="yellow">Mum, here's the medicine.</font>

127
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,203
<font color="yellow">Mother, cheer up.</font>

128
00:06:58,343 --> 00:06:59,843
<font color="yellow">She'll be fine.</font>

129
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:01,343
<font color="yellow">I mean, Jae Soon.</font>

130
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,403
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, could you leave us alone?</font>

131
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:06,103
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

132
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,943
<font color="yellow">Mother, cheer up.</font>

133
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,403
<font color="yellow">Everything will be fine.</font>

134
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:22,643
<font color="yellow">Let Gab Dol go home. It's embarrassing.</font>

135
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,143
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to be embarrassed about. He's our family.</font>

136
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:28,503
<font color="yellow">Technically, he's not our family.</font>

137
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:30,503
<font color="yellow">I just don't feel comfortable.</font>

138
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:35,043
<font color="yellow">I'm sick, and having him around makes me feel uncomfortable.</font>

139
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:36,973
<font color="yellow">And it's not like I can tell him to leave.</font>

140
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:38,673
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

141
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,273
<font color="yellow">Why? It's gloomy in there. I should be here to help.</font>

142
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,403
<font color="yellow">Leaving is helping.</font>

143
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,173
<font color="yellow">You don't have anything to do here anyway.</font>

144
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:54,743
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do. I can get her some water and do some errands.</font>

145
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:57,743
<font color="yellow">If something happens, I'm the helpful one since...</font>

146
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:00,243
<font color="yellow">Se Gye is slower than me.</font>

147
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:02,903
<font color="yellow">When you're having a hard time, it's good to have many people around you.</font>

148
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:04,703
<font color="yellow">I said, it's okay.</font>

149
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,773
<font color="yellow">It's not about how many people there are.</font>

150
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:08,843
<font color="yellow">You'd better leave. I'll follow you later.</font>

151
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:11,373
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm hungry anyway.</font>

152
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:15,843
<font color="yellow">Right. Don't say anything to your mum.</font>

153
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:18,873
<font color="yellow">Fine, I won't. It's not good news anyway.</font>

154
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:21,573
<font color="yellow">- Promise me you won't. - I won't.</font>

155
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:24,373
<font color="yellow">I'm not a child. I won't say everything to my mum.</font>

156
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,703
<font color="yellow">- Mum, I'm home. - You're late.</font>

157
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:34,003
<font color="yellow">What kind of wedding is so long?</font>

158
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:35,873
<font color="yellow">I want to eat.</font>

159
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,003
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you eat at the wedding?</font>

160
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:43,173
<font color="yellow">I was so hungry.</font>

161
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,503
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say the wedding was held in a hotel?</font>

162
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:48,773
<font color="yellow">You were bragging that you're going to have a very expensive meal.</font>

163
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,073
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you eat anything?</font>

164
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:55,073
<font color="yellow">Did they not want you to eat there?</font>

165
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:56,573
<font color="yellow">That's not how it was.</font>

166
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,573
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm sure they were like that.</font>

167
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:01,443
<font color="yellow">I told you many times.</font>

168
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:04,543
<font color="yellow">If you want to be treated well, you should deserve it.</font>

169
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:08,173
<font color="yellow">They must've made a slave of you because you look easy.</font>

170
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:11,503
<font color="yellow">Was Gab Soon doing nothing while you were mistreated like that?</font>

171
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:13,343
<font color="yellow">I should teach her a lesson.</font>

172
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,743
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything to her. This is not the time for it.</font>

173
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,503
<font color="yellow">How nice.</font>

174
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:20,373
<font color="yellow">I can't even say what I want to say to my daughter-in-law.</font>

175
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:23,873
<font color="yellow">How dare they let you starve when they feast on all the food?</font>

176
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:27,603
<font color="yellow">How stupid you are. You should've done better.</font>

177
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:30,573
<font color="yellow">It's not like you can have such an expensive meal often.</font>

178
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:34,103
<font color="yellow">You must've been doing all kinds of errands, trying to impress them.</font>

179
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:36,373
<font color="yellow">I don't want to have a son like you.</font>

180
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:38,503
<font color="yellow">That's not what happened.</font>

181
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,873
<font color="yellow">I'm not the only one who didn't eat. The whole wedding was cancelled.</font>

182
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,073
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything.</font>

183
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,243
<font color="yellow">I take that back.</font>

184
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,443
<font color="yellow">The wedding was cancelled? Why? What happened?</font>

185
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,803
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

186
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:50,643
<font color="yellow">Why was it cancelled?</font>

187
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,373
<font color="yellow">Mum, you didn't hear anything.</font>

188
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,203
<font color="yellow">What are you hiding from me?</font>

189
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:59,643
<font color="yellow">How mean. I can see that you belong to that family now.</font>

190
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,743
<font color="yellow">- That's not true. - Forget it.</font>

191
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:08,343
<font color="yellow">Promise me that you won't tell anyone.</font>

192
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:11,143
<font color="yellow">I won't. There's no one I can talk to.</font>

193
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:12,973
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

194
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:14,873
<font color="yellow">So what happened is...</font>

195
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:22,913
<font color="yellow">I'm worried we might have to have their funerals.</font>

196
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:25,443
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth.</font>

197
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:28,773
<font color="yellow">I said that because they're all just lying down like that.</font>

198
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:30,943
<font color="yellow">Please answer your phone.</font>

199
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,273
<font color="yellow">You don't have any money. What are you going to do?</font>

200
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,343
<font color="yellow">Send me your account number.</font>

201
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,203
<font color="yellow">I won't tell anyone.</font>

202
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,913
<font color="yellow">So please at least text me.</font>

203
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:45,073
<font color="yellow">Dad, please have some soup.</font>

204
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:49,203
<font color="yellow">- What about your mum? - I'll take care of her.</font>

205
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,843
<font color="yellow">What have you been doing?</font>

206
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:56,773
<font color="yellow">You're the one who needs to stay sharp...</font>

207
00:10:56,973 --> 00:11:00,003
<font color="yellow">so that we can find that witch.</font>

208
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:11,573
<font color="yellow">I'm rather worried about...</font>

209
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,243
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee than Jae Soon.</font>

210
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,703
<font color="yellow">She can put herself in trouble as she's an adult,</font>

211
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:22,773
<font color="yellow">but that kid has no idea.</font>

212
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:25,073
<font color="yellow">He is forced to suffer.</font>

213
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,003
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

214
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:31,373
<font color="yellow">She left because she's upset. Once she's calmed down, she'll return.</font>

215
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:34,273
<font color="yellow">There's nowhere she can go with Ddol Ee.</font>

216
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:36,573
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

217
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:41,203
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Jae Soon.</font>

218
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,203
<font color="yellow">She always came to...</font>

219
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:48,473
<font color="yellow">her parents whenever she divorced.</font>

220
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:52,043
<font color="yellow">And now, she's abandoned by her parents.</font>

221
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,403
<font color="yellow">I would've done the same.</font>

222
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,343
<font color="yellow">They didn't abandon her.</font>

223
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:58,503
<font color="yellow">Se Bang...</font>

224
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:02,703
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to call him that. That jerk...</font>

225
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,903
<font color="yellow">was an ex-convict. There were so many times...</font>

226
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:08,973
<font color="yellow">I wanted to say that, but I didn't.</font>

227
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,873
<font color="yellow">If I knew things were going to be like this, I would've said so.</font>

228
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:13,843
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

229
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:16,873
<font color="yellow">She was betrayed by her parents.</font>

230
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,603
<font color="yellow">I bet she wouldn't want to live.</font>

231
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,473
<font color="yellow">There are reasons why they were like that.</font>

232
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,103
<font color="yellow">They were worried about her and Ddol Ee.</font>

233
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,903
<font color="yellow">Then they'd better never worry about them again.</font>

234
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:27,503
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon.</font>

235
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:32,473
<font color="yellow">I didn't become living proof for this.</font>

236
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:35,743
<font color="yellow">I didn't know she'd be like this.</font>

237
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,003
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

238
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:48,973
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry for you.</font>

239
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:51,303
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that happened.</font>

240
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:52,643
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

241
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:58,203
<font color="yellow">Mum, Gab Soon must be tired today. Leave her alone.</font>

242
00:12:58,573 --> 00:13:00,943
<font color="yellow">All right. Take a good rest.</font>

243
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:03,973
<font color="yellow">It must've been tough with the wedding.</font>

244
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,173
<font color="yellow">I mean,</font>

245
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,803
<font color="yellow">it must've been tough dealing with the visitors.</font>

246
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:12,643
<font color="yellow">You haven't eaten anything, right? Gab Dol also ate a lot.</font>

247
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:13,943
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to prepare some food?</font>

248
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,873
<font color="yellow">No, thank you. I'm all right.</font>

249
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,403
<font color="yellow">You'd better take some rest now.</font>

250
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:19,943
<font color="yellow">Your parents must be very worried.</font>

251
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,443
<font color="yellow">Mum, aren't you going to sleep?</font>

252
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:27,473
<font color="yellow">I mean, it must've been hard to send off their daughter.</font>

253
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:29,643
<font color="yellow">You should be nice to them.</font>

254
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:32,073
<font color="yellow">It must be really heartbreaking.</font>

255
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:36,003
<font color="yellow">It might be rather better than marrying a fraud.</font>

256
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:40,643
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Well...</font>

257
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:44,043
<font color="yellow">It was the slip of the tongue.</font>

258
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:45,973
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear that from Gab Dol.</font>

259
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:49,373
<font color="yellow">I heard that from someone else.</font>

260
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:51,373
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything to him.</font>

261
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:55,103
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry. Do you want to eat something? Rice?</font>

262
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,343
<font color="yellow">- No, thank you. - Then take a good rest.</font>

263
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:13,373
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, I'm so sorry. I fell for her tricks.</font>

264
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:18,373
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your mouth? You're unbelievable.</font>

265
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:20,403
<font color="yellow">I told you so many times not to tell her.</font>

266
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:23,403
<font color="yellow">Are we really a married couple? How could you not keep it for a day?</font>

267
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:27,143
<font color="yellow">A married couple should keep each other's secret.</font>

268
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:28,743
<font color="yellow">How could you blurt it out like that?</font>

269
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,403
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to but my mum kept on prying me about it...</font>

270
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,673
<font color="yellow">so I had to.</font>

271
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:36,273
<font color="yellow">It's my mum's fault. I told her not to say it.</font>

272
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:37,973
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have told her in the first place.</font>

273
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:40,473
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just tell all our neighbours?</font>

274
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:43,103
<font color="yellow">My mum is not a nobody. She's our family.</font>

275
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,873
<font color="yellow">When was she our family?</font>

276
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:47,443
<font color="yellow">My family and your family are separate.</font>

277
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:48,873
<font color="yellow">Did you see Mother's face?</font>

278
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:50,843
<font color="yellow">She looked very satisfied.</font>

279
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:52,643
<font color="yellow">Why would you think that way?</font>

280
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:55,043
<font color="yellow">She was just worried.</font>

281
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:58,173
<font color="yellow">It might have sounded like that to you but not to me.</font>

282
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:00,373
<font color="yellow">What if all our neighbours find out?</font>

283
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:01,943
<font color="yellow">My mum won't do that.</font>

284
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,903
<font color="yellow">She can keep her mouth shut. She won't tell anybody.</font>

285
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,843
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to tell you anything from now on.</font>

286
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,773
<font color="yellow">What did my dad say to you about how a man should be?</font>

287
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:12,703
<font color="yellow">I know. You should have deep pockets and sealed mouth.</font>

288
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:15,543
<font color="yellow">I won't do it again. I'm sorry.</font>

289
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:18,743
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

290
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:21,843
<font color="yellow">Why are you mad at him?</font>

291
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:23,503
<font color="yellow">I was listening.</font>

292
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:25,703
<font color="yellow">A son can tell his mum that.</font>

293
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:29,343
<font color="yellow">It's about your family so you might want to hide it,</font>

294
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,003
<font color="yellow">but there are no secrets in this world.</font>

295
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:33,143
<font color="yellow">People are ought to find out somehow.</font>

296
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:36,343
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't make a big deal about it. He has work tomorrow.</font>

297
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:38,743
<font color="yellow">This is all your parents' fault.</font>

298
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,743
<font color="yellow">They were greedy for money,</font>

299
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:44,403
<font color="yellow">so they tried to remarry your sister without looking into the issue.</font>

300
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:47,103
<font color="yellow">Please don't talk about it if you don't know what's going on.</font>

301
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:49,073
<font color="yellow">My parents are not like that.</font>

302
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,573

00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,503
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

322
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:53,143
<font color="yellow">First of all, if your wife and your mother are arguing,</font>

323
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,173
<font color="yellow">take your mother's side.</font>

00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:54,643
<font color="yellow">It's time to take off those heavy, winter coats.</font>

456
00:27:56,943 --> 00:28:00,403
<font color="yellow">A great body makes your fashion perfect. Follow after me.</font>

457
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,543
<font color="yellow">I adjusted the broadcasting schedule.</font>

458
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:07,343
<font color="yellow">I contacted the US office.</font>

459
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:09,573
<font color="yellow">I decided to leave after launching the home shopping.</font>

460
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,603
<font color="yellow">Yes. I see.</font>

461
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:16,473
<font color="yellow">- Why are you still up? - Did you take care of business?</font>

462
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:19,443
<font color="yellow">- When are we going to the US? - Maybe next week.</font>

463
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:22,143
<font color="yellow">We will leave as soon as the home shopping work is done.</font>

464
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,273
<font color="yellow">Daddy.</font>

465
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,073
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about that again.</font>

466
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,743
<font color="yellow">- About what? - You don't have to know.</font>

467
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:13,743
<font color="yellow">Buy some gimbap.</font>

468
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:17,003
<font color="yellow">Buy some gimbap.</font>

469
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:21,303
<font color="yellow">Buy some gimbap.</font>

470
00:29:21,403 --> 00:29:22,673
<font color="yellow">- Buy some gimbap. - How much is it?</font>

471
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,073
<font color="yellow">It's 1 dollar and 50 cents.</font>

472
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:28,043
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

473
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,873
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I don't have any change.</font>

474
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:39,303
<font color="yellow">I have no time for this.</font>

475
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:50,603
<font color="yellow">Hi. Can you show me the most popular fabric?</font>

476
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:53,903
<font color="yellow">Show me alpaca and cashmere, including imported ones.</font>

477
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:00,373
<font color="yellow">(Director Yeo Si Nae)</font>

478
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:01,373
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

479
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:05,243
<font color="yellow">- Director. - Come in.</font>

480
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:15,343
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much. Words cannot express my gratitude.</font>

481
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:18,903
<font color="yellow">I stopped by after doing some fabric research at the marketplace.</font>

482
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:20,473
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

483
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,503
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to do this.</font>

484
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:26,903
<font color="yellow">From now on, when you do fabric research, bring it to me right away.</font>

485
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:29,873
<font color="yellow">I need to know the fabric trend to know the fashion trend.</font>

486
00:30:30,303 --> 00:30:31,703
<font color="yellow">I will, ma'am.</font>

487
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:34,403
<font color="yellow">I'm so excited these days.</font>

488
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:38,273
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, my life is full of excitement.</font>

489
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:40,903
<font color="yellow">I can take care of my twins now.</font>

490
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,303
<font color="yellow">Did you quit driving?</font>

491
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:44,343
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm studying at night as well.</font>

492
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:47,073
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

493
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,373
<font color="yellow">I'm always indebted to you. Someday, I will return the favour.</font>

494
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,943
<font color="yellow">I'm not the person you should thank.</font>

495
00:30:53,043 --> 00:30:56,173
<font color="yellow">I know. I will buy the foreman some bread.</font>

496
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:57,403
<font color="yellow">The foreman?</font>

497
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:07,173
<font color="yellow">My goodness! What are you doing here? It's nice to see you.</font>

498
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:09,143
<font color="yellow">I guess you're here to say hi.</font>

499
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,143
<font color="yellow">He must have been hired as a driver.</font>

500
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,673
<font color="yellow">Don't be rough with him. You should be careful.</font>

501
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:15,943
<font color="yellow">- It's because we're so close. - You're close?</font>

502
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:18,403
<font color="yellow">- No, we're not. - Let me introduce him.</font>

503
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,543
<font color="yellow">He's the director of strategic department.</font>

504
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:23,173
<font color="yellow">He's my son. Are you surprised?</font>

505
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:28,843
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

506
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:32,543
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

507
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:35,573
<font color="yellow">I told you to be respectful to him.</font>

508
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:39,273
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

509
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:43,803
<font color="yellow">Please forgive my lack of respect.</font>

510
00:31:44,473 --> 00:31:47,473
<font color="yellow">Thank you for helping me when I was working in the warehouse.</font>

511
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,903
<font color="yellow">My son wanted to learn everything about the business.</font>

512
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:52,673
<font color="yellow">That's why he was working there.</font>

513
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:55,473
<font color="yellow">- Yes. I see. - Ms Ban Ji Ha.</font>

514
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:59,073
<font color="yellow">If you're done talking to her, please go back to work.</font>

515
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:00,773
<font color="yellow">Yes, you can leave now.</font>

516
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:04,473
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

517
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:30,943
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

518
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:38,073
<font color="yellow">You are really something.</font>

519
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:41,103
<font color="yellow">Is it your hobby to mess with people? Was it fun?</font>

520
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,673
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - When I took off with the money,</font>

521
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:51,973
<font color="yellow">do you know how scared I was, thinking that it was your money?</font>

522
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:55,503
<font color="yellow">If I knew you were this rich, I would have lied and asked more.</font>

523
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:58,303
<font color="yellow">Whenever I gave you some bread, you must've been laughing inside.</font>

524
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,673
<font color="yellow">When I told you to save money, you must've mocked me.</font>

525
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:03,803
<font color="yellow">Was it fun to watch my misery?</font>

526
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:07,843
<font color="yellow">You recommended me to the design department, right?</font>

527
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:09,143
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

528
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:11,343
<font color="yellow">I did make the recommendation.</font>

529
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:13,773
<font color="yellow">However, you got the job because of your talent.</font>

530
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:16,143
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any personal motives.</font>

531
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:18,073
<font color="yellow">I just valued your talent.</font>

532
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:24,643
<font color="yellow">You can go now. Don't waste your energy.</font>

533
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:26,873
<font color="yellow">You're a player, aren't you?</font>

534
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,773
<font color="yellow">Don't mess with people's emotions.</font>

535
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:33,603
<font color="yellow">Let's be professional.</font>

536
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:35,573
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

537
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:39,103
<font color="yellow">You can come up with another design with the time you're wasting here.</font>

538
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:45,543
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You're saying that...</font>

539
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:49,903
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo asks the ladies to reject him whenever he gets set up?</font>

540
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:51,943
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

541
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:58,303
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

542
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,343
<font color="yellow">Are you sure he is not seeing anyone?</font>

543
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:01,503
<font color="yellow">I'm sure.</font>

544
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:05,073
<font color="yellow">He would have told me first if he liked a girl.</font>

545
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,943
<font color="yellow">He would have told me...</font>

546
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:10,643
<font color="yellow">even if he got a girl's number or saw a girl he liked.</font>

547
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:12,513
<font color="yellow">He hides nothing from me.</font>

548
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:14,143
<font color="yellow">Then why is he doing that?</font>

549
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:15,903
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

550
00:34:17,903 --> 00:34:19,703
<font color="yellow">Shall we eat out?</font>

551
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:21,473
<font color="yellow">When are you done tonight?</font>

552
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:26,403
<font color="yellow">Talk to me. Shall I wait for you at work?</font>

553
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:29,673
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon? Ms Gab Soon?</font>

554
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,473
<font color="yellow">Ms Gab Soon. Madam.</font>

555
00:34:36,513 --> 00:34:38,543
<font color="yellow">When are you going to talk to me?</font>

556
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:45,703
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? She didn't even say bye to me.</font>

557
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:49,013
<font color="yellow">- This is all your fault. - Ouch.</font>

558
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:50,843
<font color="yellow">She looks down on you...</font>

559
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:52,643
<font color="yellow">so she acts like that in front of me.</font>

560
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:55,303
<font color="yellow">I begged her but it didn't work.</font>

561
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:56,673
<font color="yellow">You begged? You...</font>

562
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,373
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Why would you beg?</font>

563
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,543
<font color="yellow">No wonder she's so stubborn.</font>

564
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:03,513
<font color="yellow">Great going.</font>

565
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:05,473
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

566
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:08,543
<font color="yellow">Don't do this to me. I'm already upset.</font>

567
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:11,443
<font color="yellow">If you kept your mouth shut, this wouldn't have happened.</font>

568
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,043
<font color="yellow">You told me.</font>

569
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,173
<font color="yellow">If you didn't tell me, I wouldn't have found out.</font>

570
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:18,143
<font color="yellow">Even if you knew, you should have kept your mouth shut.</font>

571
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:21,573
<font color="yellow">I would have acted the same way if you said that about my parents.</font>

572
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:23,673
<font color="yellow">Would you like it if I didn't stand up for you?</font>

573
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,603
<font color="yellow">Stop taking your wife's side.</font>

574
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:26,703
<font color="yellow">I don't even know.</font>

575
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:30,043
<font color="yellow">Don't come home!</font>

576
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:33,103
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

577
00:35:38,343 --> 00:35:39,573
<font color="yellow">Why are you alone?</font>

578
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,343
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat lunch?</font>

579
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:43,603
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like it.</font>

580
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,943
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? I didn't order anything.</font>

581
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,873
<font color="yellow">I came to pick up plates and wanted to see her.</font>

582
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:50,473
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

583
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:52,013
<font color="yellow">Is she your girlfriend or something?</font>

584
00:35:52,013 --> 00:35:53,373
<font color="yellow">Why would you come see her?</font>

585
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:54,973
<font color="yellow">Doesn't she look for me these days?</font>

586
00:35:54,973 --> 00:35:56,173
<font color="yellow">She doesn't.</font>

587
00:35:56,543 --> 00:35:59,473
<font color="yellow">Stop annoying me. I'm already annoyed.</font>

588
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,603
<font color="yellow">You look much older after you got married.</font>

589
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:03,043
<font color="yellow">You don't even order jjajangmyeon.</font>

590
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:04,543
<font color="yellow">I don't eat jjajangmyeon any more.</font>

591
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,403
<font color="yellow">I want to stop seeing you, my mum...</font>

592
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:08,973
<font color="yellow">and Gab Soon.</font>

593
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:12,573

00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,573
<font color="yellow">Would these work?</font>

607
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:17,243
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason people do this.</font>

608
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:20,543
<font color="yellow">It's quite effective. A lot of people look at them.</font>

609
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:22,143
<font color="yellow">Let's give it a try.</font>

610
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,103
<font color="yellow">What if we just wait?</font>

611
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:26,173
<font color="yellow">If we act on impulse,</font>

612
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:28,243
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon's privacy might not be protected.</font>

613
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:30,043
<font color="yellow">Everybody will recognise her.</font>

614
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:31,643
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

615
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:35,073
<font color="yellow">If people start recognising her, it'll be difficult for her.</font>

616
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:37,343
<font color="yellow">It'll be difficult for us too.</font>

617
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:38,473
<font color="yellow">People will say,</font>

618
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:40,943
<font color="yellow">"There goes Jae Soon's dad."</font>

619
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,243
<font color="yellow">"There goes Jae Soon's aunt."</font>

620
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:44,773
<font color="yellow">That's what it'll be like.</font>

621
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:48,173
<font color="yellow">And even if we find her now, she won't change her mind.</font>

622
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:50,103
<font color="yellow">She won't come back right away.</font>

623
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:53,103
<font color="yellow">We're just wondering how she's doing.</font>

624
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:55,403
<font color="yellow">People have their selfish nature.</font>

625
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,103
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

626
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:59,343
<font color="yellow">Who's selfish here?</font>

627
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,443
<font color="yellow">It's true we're worried about her,</font>

628
00:38:01,903 --> 00:38:04,073
<font color="yellow">but we're looking for Jae Soon for our sake.</font>

629
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:05,873
<font color="yellow">To relieve our worries.</font>

630
00:38:06,273 --> 00:38:07,903
<font color="yellow">We don't want to be anxious any more.</font>

631
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:12,013
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon's been hurt already...</font>

632
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:13,973
<font color="yellow">so let's just wait for her.</font>

633
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:18,013
<font color="yellow">She's 40. She can look after herself.</font>

634
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:19,103
<font color="yellow">You should stay out of this.</font>

635
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:20,943
<font color="yellow">I'm going to find her at all cost.</font>

636
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:23,703
<font color="yellow">How could you push her into it?</font>

637
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:25,403
<font color="yellow">You should have told her.</font>

638
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:28,403
<font color="yellow">You should have let her decide for herself.</font>

639
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:29,643
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

640
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:31,343
<font color="yellow">You were like this from her first marriage.</font>

641
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:33,973
<font color="yellow">You didn't think about her.</font>

642
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:35,703
<font color="yellow">You made excuses...</font>

643
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:38,543
<font color="yellow">and pushed her into getting married to make you feel better.</font>

644
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:41,303
<font color="yellow">You did the same to me.</font>

645
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:42,643
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

646
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:45,243
<font color="yellow">Fine, it's all my fault.</font>

647
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:47,703
<font color="yellow">You can resent me. Go ahead.</font>

648
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:51,573
<font color="yellow">But for now, none of that matters.</font>

649
00:38:51,843 --> 00:38:53,573
<font color="yellow">I have to find my daughter.</font>

650
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:55,103
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

651
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:57,643
<font color="yellow">Let's wait for her.</font>

652
00:38:58,243 --> 00:38:59,773
<font color="yellow">Let her come back on her own.</font>

653
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:03,743
<font color="yellow">She's been hurt. She won't come back on her own.</font>

654
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:05,143
<font color="yellow">We have to find her.</font>

655
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:07,373
<font color="yellow">She might be waiting for us.</font>

656
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,473
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to go outside if we do this.</font>

657
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:13,703
<font color="yellow">She'll be embarrassed of herself.</font>

658
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:16,203
<font color="yellow">Is this for you or Jae Soon?</font>

659
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:19,043
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - We have to find her.</font>

660
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:21,973
<font color="yellow">If something happens to her, can I blame you for it?</font>

661
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:24,403
<font color="yellow">Who cares about being embarrassed?</font>

662
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,873
<font color="yellow">You have to think about your daughter.</font>

663
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,543
<font color="yellow">Listen to him.</font>

664
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:31,203
<font color="yellow">I gave birth to Jae Soon. She's my daughter.</font>

665
00:39:31,573 --> 00:39:33,673
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who should be the most upset.</font>

666
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:36,073
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Mum. You should stop too, Dad.</font>

667
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:39,603
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if I'm doing this for Jae Soon or for myself.</font>

668
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:41,173
<font color="yellow">We can't hand these out right now.</font>

669
00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:43,143
<font color="yellow">That's my final word.</font>

670
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:05,703
<font color="yellow">A married couple shouldn't go so long without talking to each other.</font>

671
00:40:05,943 --> 00:40:08,243
<font color="yellow">You should apologise to her.</font>

672
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,573
<font color="yellow">Go watch a movie with her or go away somewhere not too far.</font>

673
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:18,943
<font color="yellow">You didn't eat right, Mum?</font>

674
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:21,903
<font color="yellow">I'll be there soon. Let me take care of my account.</font>

675
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,943
<font color="yellow">You're home early.</font>

676
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:35,543
<font color="yellow">Let's call a truce.</font>

677
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,673
<font color="yellow">I don't like this silence.</font>

678
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,103
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

679
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:42,543
<font color="yellow">Ms Gab Soon?</font>

680
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:45,043
<font color="yellow">Forgive me this once.</font>

681
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:49,773
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go for a movie? You wanted to go once a month.</font>

682
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,443
<font color="yellow">What about a getaway? Do you want to go this weekend...</font>

683
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:58,943
<font color="yellow">What was that for?</font>

684
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:00,603
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

685
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:01,743
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

686
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:04,443
<font color="yellow">I was trying to make you feel better. Stop embarrassing me.</font>

687
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:05,703
<font color="yellow">This is violence.</font>

688
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:07,703
<font color="yellow">Do you even think?</font>

689
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:09,103
<font color="yellow">This is going too far.</font>

690
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,973
<font color="yellow">You know how things are in my family and you want to go where?</font>

691
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:13,773
<font color="yellow">Movies? Getaway?</font>

692
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,673
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to use violence.</font>

693
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:18,473
<font color="yellow">Don't exaggerate it. I hardly pushed you.</font>

694
00:41:18,473 --> 00:41:21,643
<font color="yellow">If I pushed you, you would have wanted a divorce.</font>

695
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:24,143
<font color="yellow">And let me say this too.</font>

696
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:26,103
<font color="yellow">This is Jae Soon's fault.</font>

697
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:29,203
<font color="yellow">This is not how things should be. Everybody's down.</font>

698
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:31,203
<font color="yellow">How long would this go on for?</font>

699
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:33,203
<font color="yellow">Your family and us two are different.</font>

700
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:36,773
<font color="yellow">How could you... Are we really married?</font>

701
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:38,903
<font color="yellow">Get out. I don't want to talk to you.</font>

702
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:41,143
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you either.</font>

703
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:51,473
<font color="yellow">You're going to regret this.</font>

704
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:54,443
<font color="yellow">Unless you go on your knees and apologise,</font>

705
00:41:54,443 --> 00:41:56,013
<font color="yellow">I won't talk to you.</font>

706
00:42:34,773 --> 00:42:35,943
<font color="yellow">I'm ready.</font>

707
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:40,603
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

708
00:43:30,873 --> 00:43:32,403
<font color="yellow">I don't have to do this.</font>

709
00:43:41,473 --> 00:43:42,543
<font color="yellow">Weren't you asleep?</font>

710
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:44,373
<font color="yellow">I just woke up.</font>

711
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:45,803
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

712
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,603
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell? I'm going for milk delivery.</font>

713
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,843
<font color="yellow">Did you forget I do this every morning?</font>

714
00:43:51,843 --> 00:43:53,243
<font color="yellow">And you call yourself a son.</font>

715
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:12,673
<font color="yellow">Did they find out, Relief Patch?</font>

716
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:15,843
<font color="yellow">They didn't. What about you?</font>

717
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:17,203
<font color="yellow">Me neither.</font>

718
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:19,503
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

719
00:44:20,843 --> 00:44:22,003
<font color="yellow">It's heavy.</font>

720
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:27,203
<font color="yellow">You should quit.</font>

721
00:44:27,343 --> 00:44:28,603
<font color="yellow">It is too cold and tough for you.</font>

722
00:44:28,643 --> 00:44:31,543
<font color="yellow">I don't want to idle my time away. I like it since I get to exercise.</font>

723
00:44:31,643 --> 00:44:34,203
<font color="yellow">Instead, I quit working at the restaurant.</font>

724
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:37,703
<font color="yellow">My son didn't want me to work in a restaurant.</font>

725
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:38,773
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

726
00:44:39,303 --> 00:44:41,473
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it heavy? - No, it's not.</font>

727
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:43,243
<font color="yellow">If you can do it, why can't I?</font>

728
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,843
<font color="yellow">1, 2, 3. Try to cling onto my arm.</font>

729
00:44:46,903 --> 00:44:48,143
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Sure.</font>

730
00:44:54,203 --> 00:44:55,203
<font color="yellow">This one.</font>

731
00:45:29,303 --> 00:45:30,603
<font color="yellow">Aren't you eating, Gong Joo?</font>

732
00:45:31,743 --> 00:45:33,673
<font color="yellow">Leave her alone. I wonder how long she's going to be like that.</font>

733
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:36,903
<font color="yellow">I want to teach her a lesson this time. Don't spoil her.</font>

734
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:38,303
<font color="yellow">Don't be too harsh on her.</font>

735
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,943
<font color="yellow">She is spoiled because we raised her that way.</font>

736
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,873
<font color="yellow">Sir, did you go somewhere at dawn?</font>

737
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:46,973
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

738
00:45:46,973 --> 00:45:48,673
<font color="yellow">I came down to cook and...</font>

739
00:45:51,773 --> 00:45:56,573
<font color="yellow">you came in quietly like this.</font>

740
00:45:57,703 --> 00:46:00,303
<font color="yellow">What... What are you talking about?</font>

741
00:46:00,443 --> 00:46:01,573
<font color="yellow">At dawn?</font>

742
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:05,903
<font color="yellow">He didn't see anything. I didn't go anywhere. I was just sleeping.</font>

743
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:07,643
<font color="yellow">I did see you.</font>

744
00:46:10,803 --> 00:46:12,203
<font color="yellow">You are mistaken.</font>

745
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,103
<font color="yellow">I really did see you.</font>

746
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,503
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be treated unfairly. I really saw him come in.</font>

747
00:46:18,703 --> 00:46:22,303
<font color="yellow">I said I didn't. Why do you insist that you're right?</font>

748
00:46:22,373 --> 00:46:24,573
<font color="yellow">He is a sleepyhead early in the morning so he can't go out.</font>

749
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:26,773
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you weren't dreaming?</font>

750
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:28,503
<font color="yellow">You have weird dreams often.</font>

751
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:29,843
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

752
00:46:30,603 --> 00:46:32,203
<font color="yellow">I think there was a time before.</font>

753
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:36,303
<font color="yellow">The soup is cold now. Give me hot one, please.</font>

754
00:46:38,873 --> 00:46:40,273
<font color="yellow">I could swear it was him.</font>

755
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:47,603
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialed is not in service.</font>

756
00:46:47,843 --> 00:46:50,503
<font color="yellow">Please check the number again.</font>

757
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:51,703

<font color="yellow">lose them all because of you.</font>

831
00:52:04,973 --> 00:52:06,473
<font color="yellow">You're exaggerating.</font>

832
00:52:07,173 --> 00:52:09,943
<font color="yellow">What does my seeing you as a woman have anything to do with this?</font>

833
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,303
<font color="yellow">Can't you understand?</font>

834
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:15,173
<font color="yellow">I should be grateful to your mother forever.</font>

835
00:52:15,503 --> 00:52:17,943
<font color="yellow">If she finds out that we meet like this, she'll kill me.</font>

836
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:20,943
<font color="yellow">A little sympathy for me...</font>

837
00:52:21,043 --> 00:52:22,943
<font color="yellow">and your help for my babies...</font>

838
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:25,143
<font color="yellow">I'll take them until today.</font>

839
00:52:25,973 --> 00:52:27,273
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I appreciate it.</font>

840
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:29,803
<font color="yellow">You make a conclusion all by yourself.</font>

841
00:52:31,243 --> 00:52:33,873
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Shall I make noodles?</font>

842
00:52:36,643 --> 00:52:38,473
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be swayed.</font>

843
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:41,043
<font color="yellow">Who would refuse a man like you?</font>

844
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:43,443
<font color="yellow">It'd be right for me to seduce you.</font>

845
00:52:44,543 --> 00:52:48,243
<font color="yellow">But I should not do that. I don't want to be so ungrateful.</font>

846
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:51,843
<font color="yellow">I couldn't forgive a woman like me, if I were your mother.</font>

847
00:52:52,543 --> 00:52:55,573
<font color="yellow">I'm uneducated and have two kids.</font>

848
00:52:56,843 --> 00:52:59,073
<font color="yellow">And I'm old. Who would like such a woman?</font>

849
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,543
<font color="yellow">Once I feel attached to you, it'll be harder to break up.</font>

850
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:06,403
<font color="yellow">Don't try to sway or shake a poor woman.</font>

851
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:08,143
<font color="yellow">Just keep on going your way.</font>

852
00:53:10,543 --> 00:53:11,603
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

853
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:14,873
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at work, sir.</font>

854
00:53:35,873 --> 00:53:37,143
<font color="yellow">I understand what you mean.</font>

855
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:42,473
<font color="yellow">The things you're worried about will never happen.</font>

856
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:50,603
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

857
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,903
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of everything.</font>

858
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:03,773
<font color="yellow">I like her the most.</font>

859
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:05,173
<font color="yellow">She has a favourable impression.</font>

860
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,973
<font color="yellow">What's the use for us to like her? Soo Jo has to like her.</font>

861
00:54:10,403 --> 00:54:13,973
<font color="yellow">But I think he really hates going on blind dates,</font>

862
00:54:14,203 --> 00:54:16,203
<font color="yellow">considering he told the girls to reject him.</font>

863
00:54:21,173 --> 00:54:23,203
<font color="yellow">- I'm home. - Did you eat dinner?</font>

864
00:54:23,473 --> 00:54:25,843
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I did. - Could you come here and sit?</font>

865
00:54:25,973 --> 00:54:26,973
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

866
00:54:30,803 --> 00:54:33,603
<font color="yellow">Speak honestly. Do you not want to go on blind dates?</font>

867
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,503
<font color="yellow">Do you have a woman you like?</font>

868
00:54:36,503 --> 00:54:38,343
<font color="yellow">I heard you told the girls to reject you first.</font>

869
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:41,503
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I don't want to go on blind dates.</font>

870
00:54:41,503 --> 00:54:43,403
<font color="yellow">Why not? Don't you want to get married?</font>

871
00:54:43,773 --> 00:54:47,043
<font color="yellow">I'll get married someday, but I don't want blind dates.</font>

872
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:48,973
<font color="yellow">Do you have a girlfriend?</font>

873
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:52,443
<font color="yellow">If your mother finds out, she'll kill me.</font>

874
00:54:53,073 --> 00:54:54,443
<font color="yellow">If you have a girlfriend, just tell me.</font>

875
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:57,603
<font color="yellow">I don't.</font>

876
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:02,803
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mal Nyeon's nephew.</font>

877

879
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,173
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

880
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,243

882
00:55:22,043 --> 00:55:24,903
<font color="yellow">Tell her she can call me day or night.</font>

883

887

890

<font color="yellow">I don't understand my sister.</font>

893
00:56:09,543 --> 00:56:12,143
<font color="yellow">How could she disappear with her child?</font>

894
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,503
<font color="yellow">She is hopeless.</font>

895
00:56:14,503 --> 00:56:16,043

896
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,773
<font color="yellow">See? You just said she is hopeless and that was cold.</font>

897
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,743
<font color="yellow">It is true.</font>

898
00:56:23,803 --> 00:56:24,803
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful.</font>

899
00:56:25,843 --> 00:56:28,343
