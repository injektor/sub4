together since you've come here.</font>

won't have anything to eat.</font>

139

00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,550
<font color="yellow">I don't expect anything from Gab Dol.</font>

155
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,744
<font color="yellow">I'd love it if one of them
would buy me a house.</font>

156
00:12:58,014 --> 00:12:59,890
<font color="yellow">Either Se Bang or Se Gye.</font>

157
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,290
<font color="yellow">Dream on. What did Jae Soon say?</font>

158
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,190
<font color="yellow">I don't know whom she takes after.</font>

159
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:08,150
<font color="yellow">She should go look around the house
if she's going to live in it.</font>

160
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,790
<font color="yellow">She just stood there. She was
like a fish out of water.</font>

161
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,314
<font color="yellow">It was as if she was a third wheel.</font>

162
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:15,244
<font color="yellow">There's no use.</font>

163
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,614
<font color="yellow">I don't see what Se Bang sees in her.</font>

164
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,314
<font color="yellow">It's weirder if she's
bursting out with joy.</font>

165
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:22,814
<font color="yellow">Leave her be.</font>

166
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:26,674
<font color="yellow">Seeing how she's going with it, she
must want to get back together.</font>

167
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,144
<font color="yellow">- When will they buy the house?
- They're going to do it soon.</font>

168
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:34,774
<font color="yellow">How did Se Bang get so much money?</font>

169
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:38,574
<font color="yellow">When he got divorced, he
had nothing but debt.</font>

170
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,244
<font color="yellow">I need to see you.</font>

171
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,014
<font color="yellow">Not at home. Outside.</font>

172
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,644
<font color="yellow">Do you like the house?</font>

173
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:04,414
<font color="yellow">Mum does.</font>

174
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,844
<font color="yellow">Not your mother. I'm asking you.</font>

175
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:10,144
<font color="yellow">If you like it, let's go with it.</font>

176
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:12,514
<font color="yellow">Before that, I want to ask you something.</font>

177
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,074
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

178
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,114
<font color="yellow">Do you want to live with me?</font>

179
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,244
<font color="yellow">Can't you see?</font>

180
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:22,220
<font color="yellow">Setting our child aside, I'm
asking about you and me.</font>

181
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:23,844
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about us?</font>

182
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:25,614
<font color="yellow">I am. And you?</font>

183
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:31,920
<font color="yellow">Do you still have feelings for him?</font>

184
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:34,544
<font color="yellow">- What are you saying?
- I understand.</font>

185
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,343
<font color="yellow">You lived with him for over a year.</font>

186
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,144
<font color="yellow">You must've developed feelings.</font>

187
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,244
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it won't go away that easily.</font>

188
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:45,343
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about that man.
I'm talking about us.</font>

189
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,614
<font color="yellow">"That man"?</font>

190
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:50,574
<font color="yellow">You seem to still have feelings for him.</font>

191
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,544
<font color="yellow">Are you hesitating because of him?</font>

192
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:54,844
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

193
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,244
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you got
married because of the debt?</font>

194
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:59,244
<font color="yellow">I guess not.</font>

195
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:03,514
<font color="yellow">He abused his own child
and made him get therapy.</font>

196
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:06,474
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep clinging onto such a guy?</font>

197
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:12,243
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

198
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,613
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hesitating...</font>

199
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,914
<font color="yellow">because of that Jo Geum Sik or whatever?</font>

200
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,214
<font color="yellow">You and I...</font>

201
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:29,714
<font color="yellow">are like a broken bowl and spilled water.</font>

202
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,513
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid of...</font>

203
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,914
<font color="yellow">getting back together just
because of the child.</font>

204
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,044
<font color="yellow">I was in such a pain...</font>

205
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,413
<font color="yellow">and I don't want to repeat that.</font>

206
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:39,974
<font color="yellow">That's why I wanted to check.</font>

207
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,114
<font color="yellow">Could you be a little more
respectful to your husband?</font>

208
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,374
<font color="yellow">So what's your point?</font>

209
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,814
<font color="yellow">Am I still...</font>

210
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,314
<font color="yellow">a woman to you?</font>

211
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:57,014
<font color="yellow">Of course, you're a woman.
You're not a man.</font>

212
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:58,744
<font color="yellow">We're still young.</font>

213
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:02,214
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's right to get back
together just because of our kid.</font>

214
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:04,913
<font color="yellow">I think we both need to be ready...</font>

215
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,974
<font color="yellow">to live as a man and a woman, as a couple.</font>

216
00:16:07,944 --> 00:16:10,104
<font color="yellow">I don't want to remarry you
just because of the child.</font>

217
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:13,574
<font color="yellow">You're still not over him, are you?</font>

218
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,343
<font color="yellow">Could you please listen to me?</font>

219
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,713
<font color="yellow">Why do you only hear what you want to hear?</font>

220
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,213
<font color="yellow">You were like that throughout our marriage.</font>

221
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,313
<font color="yellow">That's why I was frustrated. We
couldn't have a proper conversation.</font>

222
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:24,873
<font color="yellow">You don't listen to what I say.</font>

223
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:27,043
<font color="yellow">You interpret and remember
my words as you like.</font>

224
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,444
<font color="yellow">You're stubborn and unreasonable.</font>

225
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:31,244
<font color="yellow">So it is because of him.</font>

228
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,244

230
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:57,543
<font color="yellow">I hope you understand.</font>

231
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,843
<font color="yellow">We have to go because of my work.</font>

232
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:01,743
<font color="yellow">I heard there are many
good schools in the US.</font>

233
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:03,373
<font color="yellow">Some can't study abroad
even if they want to.</font>

234
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:05,344
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know how lucky she is.</font>

235
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:08,213
<font color="yellow">Don't mind about her and bring me instead.</font>

236
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:09,374
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go.</font>

237
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,313
<font color="yellow">I want to study here.</font>

238
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:12,944
<font color="yellow">There will be a lot of Korean
friends there as well.</font>

239
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,874
<font color="yellow">Please, Cho Rong.</font>

240
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,744
<font color="yellow">We need to deal with the school first.
We don't have time.</font>

241
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,014
<font color="yellow">Cho...</font>

242
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:24,044
<font color="yellow">Daddy, she looks really upset.</font>

243
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:31,684
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

244
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,143
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ma'am.</font>

245
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:41,573
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Ms Ban. How is it going?
- Good.</font>

246
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:43,343
<font color="yellow">Please report the clearance
items by this week.</font>

247
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:44,613
<font color="yellow">All right, Ma'am.</font>

248
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,243
<font color="yellow">Come. Let me introduce you to her.</font>

249
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:47,544
<font color="yellow">He's a new employee.</font>

250
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:52,514
<font color="yellow">You should be honoured.</font>

251
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,913
<font color="yellow">He's still a bit clumsy. I'll make sure...</font>

252
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,244
<font color="yellow">I train him to be a good worker.</font>

253
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,544
<font color="yellow">Don't be too harsh on him.</font>

254
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:01,044
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

255
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:02,973
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

256
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:05,344
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to
touch others like that.</font>

257
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:09,473
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'm not supposed
to touch a man like that.</font>

258
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:11,414
<font color="yellow">Be careful and stay healthy.</font>

259
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:14,684
<font color="yellow">- Sir, let's go.
- Yes, Ma'am.</font>

260
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,243
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she cares a lot about...</font>

261
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:22,213
<font color="yellow">new employees.</font>

262
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:23,614
<font color="yellow">She told you to be careful.</font>

263
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:29,414
<font color="yellow">She seemed nice, didn't she?</font>

264
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,314
<font color="yellow">To be honest...</font>

265
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:34,544
<font color="yellow">Don't tell others.</font>

266
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:37,574
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have a strong
academic background...</font>

267
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:40,344
<font color="yellow">but she's amazingly skilled. She
does a lot of good deeds, too.</font>

268
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:42,113
<font color="yellow">She does good deeds?</font>

269
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:45,213
<font color="yellow">She does a lot of charity work
which helped me a lot as well.</font>

270
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:47,514
<font color="yellow">- How?
- That's a secret.</font>

271
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,943
<font color="yellow">Anyway, if you need any
help, you can just tell me.</font>

272
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,244
<font color="yellow">We're really close.</font>

273
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:54,214
<font color="yellow">I'm, so to speak, "a secret adviser".</font>

274
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:59,543
<font color="yellow">But you seem to have a lot of
secrets as well. You don't talk.</font>

275
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,224
<font color="yellow">You said you had a big family, didn't you?</font>

276
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:04,244
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- You're not married.</font>

277
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,154
<font color="yellow">You don't have a girlfriend, do you?</font>

278
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:07,344
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

279
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,214
<font color="yellow">If you have a big family to support,
it'd be hard to date someone.</font>

280
00:19:11,914 --> 00:19:13,714
<font color="yellow">I can imagine.</font>

281
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:15,574
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

282
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:17,374
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

283
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:19,114
<font color="yellow">Just keep it.</font>

284
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:22,244
<font color="yellow">I took some for myself as well.</font>

285
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:25,143
<font color="yellow">You should eat when you can.</font>

286
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:27,914
<font color="yellow">You should be a little
brazen not to starve.</font>

287
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:36,774
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

288
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:49,213
<font color="yellow">How do you like the work?</font>

289
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:50,614
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too tough?</font>

290
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,044
<font color="yellow">Why do you bring bread every day?</font>

291
00:19:57,574 --> 00:19:59,214
<font color="yellow">Is everything all right with Grandfather?</font>

292
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,343
<font color="yellow">- Is it because of me?
- No.</font>

293
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:02,974
<font color="yellow">I think it's something with your mother.</font>

294
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:06,613
<font color="yellow">It seems like your mother defeated him...</font>

295
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,184
<font color="yellow">after a severe fight.</font>

296
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:11,444
<font color="yellow">Ever since then, he looks very depressed.</font>

297
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:41,344
<font color="yellow">I'm so lucky to have a son who
brings me expensive strawberries.</font>

298
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:53,114
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have spent so much money.</font>

299
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:55,143
<font color="yellow">You got me samgyetang, strawberries...</font>

300
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:57,373
<font color="yellow">and some pocket money as well.</font>

301
00:20:57,374 --> 00:20:59,443
<font color="yellow">You should quit your job
and take a good rest.</font>

302
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:01,214
<font color="yellow">We'll do the housework.</font>

303
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:02,744
<font color="yellow">Sleep well too.</font>

304
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,574
<font color="yellow">When did you come home?</font>

305
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:20,013
<font color="yellow">You should've let me know that you're home.</font>

306
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,474
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you say something
I shouldn't hear?</font>

307
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:24,744
<font color="yellow">Do you want some?</font>

308
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,244
<font color="yellow">I don't.</font>

309
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:29,614
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me to eat the bruised ones?</font>

310
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:30,974
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

311
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:36,414
<font color="yellow">I didn't know they're bruised.
They remind me of myself.</font>

312
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:41,444
<font color="yellow">You could've prepared rice if you're home.</font>

313
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:42,813
<font color="yellow">We don't have rice?</font>

314
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:45,043
<font color="yellow">Let's say whoever comes home
first prepares the rice.</font>

315
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:47,013
<font color="yellow">You just said we're going to
do the housework, didn't you?</font>

316
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,944
<font color="yellow">Who are "we"? Is it me?</font>

317
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:51,573
<font color="yellow">I hope it doesn't mean you want
me to do all the housework.</font>

318
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:53,643
<font color="yellow">I'll do the darn rice.</font>

319
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,713
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with women?</font>

320
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,913
<font color="yellow">What's the big deal? You
flip out whenever...</font>

321
00:21:57,914 --> 00:21:59,814
<font color="yellow">we ask you to cook rice.</font>

322
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:02,174
<font color="yellow">I don't want to eat.</font>

323
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:10,844
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

324
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,774
<font color="yellow">Could you...</font>

325
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,243
<font color="yellow">give me the allowance a little earlier?</font>

326
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:18,244
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I just need some in advance.</font>

327
00:22:18,574 --> 00:22:20,344
<font color="yellow">I need to spend some money.</font>

328
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:23,173
<font color="yellow">I think I already have withdrawal
from the lack of money.</font>

329
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:24,543
<font color="yellow">Sure you do.</font>

330
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,673
<font color="yellow">Pocket money, samgyetang and
strawberries for your mother...</font>

331
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:28,843
<font color="yellow">must be expensive.</font>

332
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:30,643
<font color="yellow">I did that because she's sick.</font>

333
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:32,843
<font color="yellow">What would you think if I gave some
money to my parents behind you?</font>

334
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:34,913
<font color="yellow">My mum has been through a lot.</font>

335
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,573
<font color="yellow">What about my mum?</font>

336
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:38,243
<font color="yellow">My mum has been through a lot as well.</font>

337
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:40,174
<font color="yellow">You said she's going to
quit her job as well.</font>

338
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:43,614
<font color="yellow">She must think we make a lot
of money since we both work.</font>

339
00:22:44,144 --> 00:22:46,313
<font color="yellow">You should rather try to tighten your belt,</font>

340
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:48,073
<font color="yellow">not waste money.</font>

341
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:49,613
<font color="yellow">Know how to be economical.</font>

342
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:51,044
<font color="yellow">Stop talking about money.</font>

343
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:54,150
<font color="yellow">You talk like a wife who's been
living with me for ten years.</font>

344
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:56,374
<font color="yellow">Why are you so unhappy about
my mum's quitting her job?</font>

345
00:22:56,774 --> 00:23:00,043
<font color="yellow">It's nothing about us.
It's because she's sick.</font>

346
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:02,214
<font color="yellow">I don't want her to work
even if she wants to.</font>

347
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,373
<font color="yellow">I don't want her to work in a
restaurant despite the fact...</font>

348
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,043
<font color="yellow">that her son is a public
official and married.</font>

349
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:09,613
<font color="yellow">Imagine how others would think of me.</font>

350
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:11,743
<font color="yellow">Why do you care so much about others?</font>

351
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:13,643
<font color="yellow">Many people keep working
at old age these days.</font>

352
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,673
<font color="yellow">Then why aren't your parents working?</font>

353
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:18,414
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Am I wrong? They both don't work.</font>

354
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,213
<font color="yellow">You can't compare my
parents to your mother.</font>

355
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:22,613
<font color="yellow">What's the difference?</font>

356
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:23,873
<font color="yellow">Because their son is a doctor?</font>

357
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:24,973
<font color="yellow">Don't be sarcastic.</font>

358
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:27,414
<font color="yellow">My parents are not dependent on us.</font>

359
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:30,073
<font color="yellow">Your mother isn't even 60 yet.</font>

360
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,173
<font color="yellow">She can help us out for
at least 10 more years.</font>

361
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:35,574
<font color="yellow">We live for 100 years, which means
we need to support her for 40 years.</font>

362
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,114
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to buy a
house and have children?</font>

363
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:40,113
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you to take
the responsibility.</font>

364
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:43,043
<font color="yellow">You care about nothing but your mother.</font>

365
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:44,914
<font color="yellow">You always talk about your mother.</font>

366
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:47,473
<font color="yellow">I should've noticed when we were dating.</font>

367
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:50,114
<font color="yellow">You didn't care when I was
sick for the entire night,</font>

368
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:53,173
<font color="yellow">but you got samgyetang and
strawberries for your mum.</font>

369
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:56,174
<font color="yellow">I like samgyetang and strawberries as well.</font>

370
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,614
<font color="yellow">I'm just striving to save
as much money as possible.</font>

371
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:02,344
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure why I married you.</font>

372
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,614
<font color="yellow">I'd like to order samgyetang.</font>

373
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:14,874
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

374
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:18,544
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

375
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:24,974
<font color="yellow">Is it tasty?</font>

376
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:26,974
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

377
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:29,173
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

378
00:24:29,174 --> 00:24:31,043
<font color="yellow">So this is what you want.</font>

379
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:34,973
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's become penniless together.</font>

380
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,373
<font color="yellow">That's not going to happen just
because of a bowl of samgyetang.</font>

381
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:40,413
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean. Let's eat
whatever we want to eat.</font>

382
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,074
<font color="yellow">If you want, you can order yours as well.</font>

383
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,313
<font color="yellow">I'll stop being frugal from now on.</font>

384
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,873
<font color="yellow">I don't care about a house or children.
I'll eat and buy...</font>

385
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:48,173
<font color="yellow">whatever I want.</font>

386
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:50,714
<font color="yellow">- Let's manage our own money then.
- Sure.</font>

387
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:52,514
<font color="yellow">Give me my bankbook.</font>

388
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:56,614
<font color="yellow">I was insane.</font>

389
00:24:56,814 --> 00:24:59,844
<font color="yellow">I was crazy to marry you even though
I already knew you were like this.</font>

390
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,914
<font color="yellow">Do you know what makes me angry?</font>

391
00:25:02,174 --> 00:25:06,014
<font color="yellow">I feel as if I split you in half
and shared you with your mum.</font>

392
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:09,474
<font color="yellow">It's like I barged in
between you and your mum.</font>

393
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,820
<font color="yellow">How could you say so? Do you know
what my mum is going through now?</font>

394
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,214
<font color="yellow">What is she going through?</font>

395
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:16,544
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

396
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:32,674
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

397
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:35,744
<font color="yellow">Why? Did your mother-in-law
say something again?</font>

398
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:37,590
<font color="yellow">No. I hate Gab Dol more than her now.</font>

399
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:38,614
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

400
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:40,574
<font color="yellow">He gave her money without my knowing.</font>

401
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:41,774
<font color="yellow">Without your knowing?</font>

402
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:45,190
<font color="yellow">I knew it. He cares about her too much.</font>

403
00:25:45,214 --> 00:25:49,444
<font color="yellow">A widow's son usually
takes great care of her.</font>

404
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:52,114
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol is not doing his job very
well between you and his mum.</font>

405
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:53,604
<font color="yellow">Just like Joong Nyeon in the past.</font>

406
00:25:54,014 --> 00:25:56,514
<font color="yellow">- I was good at it.
- As if.</font>

407
00:25:56,674 --> 00:26:00,614
<font color="yellow">They should live alone. Why did they
take my daughter and let her suffer?</font>

408
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:03,344
<font color="yellow">He was all talk.</font>

409
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:07,044
<font color="yellow">He said he won't let you have a hard
time and live happily with you.</font>

410
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:08,390
<font color="yellow">What a liar.</font>

411
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:09,614
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, go home.</font>

412
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:12,244
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to tell on him?</font>

413
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:15,050
<font color="yellow">Take care of your problems
at your own place.</font>

414
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,873
<font color="yellow">Money is the most important
issue between married couples.</font>

415
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:18,914
<font color="yellow">Sure, it is.</font>

416
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:23,190
<font color="yellow">It was money that ruined your
parents' relationship of 40 years.</font>

417
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,314
<font color="yellow">Once he makes a promise, he must keep it.</font>

418
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:27,913
<font color="yellow">He should not save his own money...</font>

419
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:30,990
<font color="yellow">and give his mum allowance
without letting you know.</font>

420
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:33,190
<font color="yellow">If so, you won't be able
to trust each other later.</font>

421
00:26:33,214 --> 00:26:36,444
<font color="yellow">I think you should call
him over and tell him.</font>

422
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:57,644
<font color="yellow">No matter what, I'd better go to work.</font>

423
00:26:58,044 --> 00:27:00,744
<font color="yellow">I should earn my own bread.
Whom would I rely on?</font>

424
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:07,544
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

425
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:11,490
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ma'am. You were working here.</font>

426
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:12,744
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

427
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,674
<font color="yellow">Did you come here for work?</font>

428
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,214
<font color="yellow">You said you quit.</font>

429
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:20,020
<font color="yellow">You ached all over. Why did you come here?</font>

430
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:22,244
<font color="yellow">Even though I'm sick, I
would die while working.</font>

431
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,973
<font color="yellow">Until I die, I will make my own living.</font>

432
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:26,514
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and stop
arguing with your wife.</font>

433
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:29,044
<font color="yellow">Are you arguing even
before I become a burden?</font>

434
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:31,420
<font color="yellow">We didn't argue.</font>

435
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:34,850
<font color="yellow">Once your children gets married,
you want to see them live happily.</font>

436
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:37,114
<font color="yellow">No parent would want to hear them fight.</font>

437
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:39,574
<font color="yellow">I won't live off of you so don't worry.</font>

438
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,350
<font color="yellow">Just take care of yourselves.</font>

439
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:43,344
<font color="yellow">I told you I would take
responsibility for you.</font>

440
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:46,644
<font color="yellow">Quit the job immediately. Or
don't say that you're sick.</font>

441
00:27:58,174 --> 00:27:59,744
<font color="yellow">You must feel upset...</font>

442
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,644
<font color="yellow">to see her doing hard work.</font>

443
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:04,673
<font color="yellow">When my mum comes back
exhausted after teaching,</font>

444
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,574
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry for her too.</font>

445
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:10,244
<font color="yellow">You must feel worse since your
mum is doing harder work.</font>

446
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:12,344
<font color="yellow">Shall we go?</font>

447
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:18,574
<font color="yellow">Hello, Father.</font>

448
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:21,114
<font color="yellow">Please stop by after work.</font>

449
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:22,514
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

450
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:27,814
<font color="yellow">Don't feel hurt...</font>

451
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:30,264
<font color="yellow">and think of this as an
advice from your father.</font>

452
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:32,914
<font color="yellow">Money...</font>

453
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:37,114
<font color="yellow">may seem to be nothing, but it is not true.</font>

454
00:28:37,344 --> 00:28:39,474
<font color="yellow">Does the money you earn all belong to you?</font>

455
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:41,220
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

456
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:43,944
<font color="yellow">You are married. How could
you think like that?</font>

457
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,190
<font color="yellow">That's what we promised.</font>

458
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,890
<font color="yellow">The money I earn is mine and the
money Gab Soon earns is hers.</font>

459
00:28:50,914 --> 00:28:53,950
<font color="yellow">Do you own money separately? I heard
she would take care of the money.</font>

460
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:55,520
<font color="yellow">We'll each pay for living expenses...</font>

461
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:57,050
<font color="yellow">and the accountant will
take care of the money.</font>

462
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:58,244
<font color="yellow">- The accountant?
- The accountant?</font>

463
00:28:58,414 --> 00:28:59,414
<font color="yellow">I mean Gab Soon.</font>

464
00:28:59,415 --> 00:29:02,214
<font color="yellow">Do you think you are still school friends?
You can't call her that.</font>

465
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:07,520
<font color="yellow">No matter how much each of you earn,
the money belongs to both of you.</font>

466
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:09,043
<font color="yellow">If you only keep the money you earn...</font>

467
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:11,814
<font color="yellow">and use separately, that's not a marriage.</font>

468
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,314
<font color="yellow">They say young people are
like that these days.</font>

469
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:17,613
<font color="yellow">In my generation, we gave all the
money we earned to the wives,</font>

470
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,120
<font color="yellow">let them buy houses and raise kids.</font>

471
00:29:19,144 --> 00:29:21,820
<font color="yellow">Do you want to take care of your own money?</font>

472
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,013
<font color="yellow">That's ridiculous.</font>

473
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:25,944
<font color="yellow">We should follow as the world changes.
What else can we do?</font>

474
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:27,244
<font color="yellow">I heard you gave your mum...</font>

475
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:29,544
<font color="yellow">allowance without Gab Soon's knowing.</font>

476
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:31,750
<font color="yellow">It's not wrong to give her allowance but...</font>

477
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:34,813
<font color="yellow">If you made a promise, you have to keep it.</font>

478
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,214
<font color="yellow">At least, you shouldn't have
let her know until the end.</font>

479
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:41,244
<font color="yellow">If they find out, any woman would
feel angry and wouldn't trust you.</font>

480
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:42,814
<font color="yellow">You can say that again.</font>

481
00:29:42,944 --> 00:29:45,144
<font color="yellow">Whenever you bought something delicious...</font>

482
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:49,174
<font color="yellow">and gave your mum without letting
me know, I was so upset.</font>

483
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,074
<font color="yellow">I still have a grudge against it.</font>

484
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,314
<font color="yellow">Don't buy samgyetang or strawberries...</font>

485
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:55,820
<font color="yellow">only for your mum.</font>

486
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:58,420
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon must have been so sad.</font>

487
00:29:58,444 --> 00:30:01,820
<font color="yellow">Food can either make you click
or ruin the relationship.</font>

488
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:04,114
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you buy enough to share?</font>

489
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,773
<font color="yellow">It was shameful of you.</font>

490
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:08,244
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon also ordered samgyetang
and ate it in the end.</font>

491
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:11,074
<font color="yellow">Imagine how mad she was.</font>

492
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,944
<font color="yellow">You think it's trivial, don't you?</font>

493
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:15,744
<font color="yellow">Those trivial things can
ruin the love of couples...</font>

494
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:17,214
<font color="yellow">and make you lose faith.</font>

495
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:20,974
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this since I think of
you as my son so don't be upset...</font>

496
00:30:21,614 --> 00:30:24,474
<font color="yellow">- and do what I tell you to do.
- Sure, you have to.</font>

497
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:26,814
<font color="yellow">Listen to him carefully.</font>

498
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:42,374
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong? That was a big sigh.</font>

499
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,614
<font color="yellow">Are you not talking to me any more?</font>

500
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,644
<font color="yellow">You get upset so easily.</font>

501
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:52,734
<font color="yellow">You haven't changed at all
for the last 10 years.</font>

502
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:55,314
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with your father?</font>

503
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:56,973
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

504
00:30:56,974 --> 00:31:00,244
<font color="yellow">He tells me to think of him as my
father but he keeps telling me off.</font>

505
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:02,814
<font color="yellow">- What did he say to you?
- You know very well.</font>

506
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:05,344
<font color="yellow">You told on me about everything.
Why do you ask?</font>

507
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:09,054
<font color="yellow">Do you feel happy when your
husband gets humiliated?</font>

508
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,514
<font color="yellow">You told them every detail. There
will be no secret between us.</font>

509
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:15,843
<font color="yellow">How could a wife reveal everything
about us to her parents?</font>

510
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:18,044
<font color="yellow">You are the one who treated
me as an accountant.</font>

511
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:20,614
<font color="yellow">Do you now realise that
it is not appropriate?</font>

512
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:26,244
<font color="yellow">Does your father think so little of me?</font>

513
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:28,914
<font color="yellow">Everyone in your family
took turns to scold me.</font>

514
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:31,244
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

515
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:35,774
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

516
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:38,374
<font color="yellow">Were you scolded again
by the in-laws today?</font>

517
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:40,214
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

518
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,014
<font color="yellow">We are out of green onions.</font>

519
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,974
<font color="yellow">Should I buy some?</font>

520
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:53,920
<font color="yellow">- Can you go grocery shopping?
- I've done many times.</font>

521
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:55,314
<font color="yellow">But you didn't do it alone.</font>

522
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,714
<font color="yellow">Please do grocery shopping then.
I'll make a list.</font>

523
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:59,744
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Joong Nyeon, let me tag along.</font>

524
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:01,144
<font color="yellow">I want to buy a corn dog.</font>

525
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,974
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure it was around here?
- Yes.</font>

526
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:15,114
<font color="yellow">She came out of that store
while eating a corn dog.</font>

527
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:18,650
<font color="yellow">I kept watching for days
but I can't see her.</font>

528
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:20,214
<font color="yellow">Maybe you didn't notice her.</font>

529
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:22,750
<font color="yellow">But you said she hadn't changed a bit.</font>

530
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,043
<font color="yellow">Her height remains the same, too.
She didn't grow at all.</font>

531
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,774
<font color="yellow">She already grew up back then.</font>

532
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:30,614
<font color="yellow">If she remained the same, I
couldn't have missed her.</font>

533
00:32:31,914 --> 00:32:33,614
<font color="yellow">She is dead if I catch her.</font>

534
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:37,144
<font color="yellow">I didn't forget your corn dog.</font>

535
00:32:37,544 --> 00:32:38,944
<font color="yellow">I bought two of them.</font>

536
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:45,414
<font color="yellow">Miss.</font>

537
00:32:45,874 --> 00:32:47,874
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

538
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:51,244
<font color="yellow">I did some grocery shopping.</font>

539
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:54,374
<font color="yellow">Would you like to eat some?</font>

540
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,914
<font color="yellow">I don't like eating food on the street.</font>

541
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:59,684
<font color="yellow">I didn't buy them for myself. I
bought them for someone else.</font>

542
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:02,914
<font color="yellow">Are you sick or something?</font>

543
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:05,243
<font color="yellow">You don't look well.</font>

544
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,514
<font color="yellow">I think I have a cold. I don't feel good.</font>

545
00:33:07,614 --> 00:33:10,514
<font color="yellow">Since you are alone, you should
take care of yourself very well.</font>

546
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:12,690
<font color="yellow">Now that you married your son off,</font>

547
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:15,214
<font color="yellow">enjoy your life and go on trips too.</font>

548
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:18,774
<font color="yellow">Since we already met, I'd
like to say something.</font>

549
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,014
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what you mean.</font>

550
00:33:20,114 --> 00:33:23,720
<font color="yellow">How could you call my precious son
over and scold him every day?</font>

551
00:33:23,744 --> 00:33:26,644
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- How could you be his father?</font>

552
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:28,974
<font color="yellow">His father is lying down in his grave.</font>

553
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,643
<font color="yellow">Would you feel happy if I told
Gab Soon off every day...</font>

554
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:33,344
<font color="yellow">when she comes home after work?</font>

555
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:37,174
<font color="yellow">He is busy while doing his
job as a public official.</font>

556
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:39,944
<font color="yellow">I can barely watch him
because he is so precious.</font>

557
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:41,914
<font color="yellow">I didn't call him over every day.</font>

558
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:43,674
<font color="yellow">You called him over so many times.</font>

559
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:47,174
<font color="yellow">They just got married, but you tell
him to come for drinks too often.</font>

560
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,774
<font color="yellow">I wanted to say something,
but I tolerated it.</font>

561
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,814
<font color="yellow">But you were training
my son as you do a dog.</font>

562
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:55,714
<font color="yellow">A dog?</font>

563
00:33:56,074 --> 00:33:58,114
<font color="yellow">Then are you saying Gab Dol is a dog?</font>

564
00:33:58,444 --> 00:34:00,744
<font color="yellow">I already knew that you say harsh words...</font>

565
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:02,944
<font color="yellow">but you are going too far.</font>

566
00:34:03,214 --> 00:34:06,544
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't feel this upset if
you gave him a lot of money.</font>

567
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,444
<font color="yellow">I'm very careful not to
hurt my own son's feelings.</font>

568
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:12,344
<font color="yellow">How could you tell my son off?</font>

569
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:16,450
<font color="yellow">I think you're nagging my son
because you don't work at all.</font>

570
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:19,514
<font color="yellow">If you don't have anything to do,
do some shopping and run errands.</font>

571
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:22,114
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- I've tolerated a lot.</font>

572
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:25,544
<font color="yellow">I'm tolerating whatever Gab Soon does.</font>

573
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:29,244
<font color="yellow">Just remember Gab Soon
is in my house with me.</font>

574
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:30,644
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

575
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:35,514
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

576
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:38,514
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me to do errands again.</font>

577
00:34:38,914 --> 00:34:42,444
<font color="yellow">Since I carry a grocery bag, I'm
considered to have nothing to do.</font>

578
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:43,990
<font color="yellow">Buy your own food.</font>

579
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:46,244
<font color="yellow">I said I'd tag along.</font>

580
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:49,720
<font color="yellow">You insisted on going yourself. Did
someone say something about it?</font>

581
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:50,844
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

582
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:54,874
<font color="yellow">Take one.</font>

583
00:34:55,244 --> 00:34:56,614
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

584
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:01,614
<font color="yellow">I hear you only had porridge this morning.</font>

585
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:05,414
<font color="yellow">Grandpa.</font>

586
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:07,974
<font color="yellow">Try eating this and feel better.</font>

587
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,144
<font color="yellow">You should eat something.</font>

588
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:11,774
<font color="yellow">I have no appetite.</font>

589
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,614
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like eating.</font>

590
00:35:13,714 --> 00:35:15,744
<font color="yellow">What if you have to go
to the hospital again?</font>

591
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:18,644
<font color="yellow">Do you keep in touch with Se Gye?</font>

592
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:21,714
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

593
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:26,474
<font color="yellow">I need to see him but I'm
too tired right now.</font>

594
00:35:27,114 --> 00:35:28,774
<font color="yellow">I'll have to see him next time.</font>

595
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,650
<font color="yellow">Have some pastries.</font>

596
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:36,743
<font color="yellow">Have some pastries.</font>

597
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:38,144
<font color="yellow">- Great.
- Thank you.</font>

598
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:45,614
<font color="yellow">Geum Soo Jo!</font>

599
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:48,914
<font color="yellow">Give it back.</font>

600
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,514
<font color="yellow">I took one for Ban Ji Ha.</font>

601
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:56,743
<font color="yellow">He learned a bad habit from you.</font>

602
00:35:56,744 --> 00:35:59,114
<font color="yellow">Don't steal pastries, okay?</font>

603
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,114
<font color="yellow">Did you keep one for me?</font>

604
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:04,814
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

605
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:07,114
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

606
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:17,014
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

607
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:21,614
<font color="yellow">This is my secret place.</font>

608
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:25,714
<font color="yellow">I take a nap here when I'm tired.
The manager can't find me here.</font>

609
00:36:26,944 --> 00:36:29,613
<font color="yellow">I come here to cry out loud...</font>

610
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:30,674
<font color="yellow">and nobody will know.</font>

611
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:37,420
<font color="yellow">Why don't you tell me
anything about yourself?</font>

612
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:38,814
<font color="yellow">Tell me something.</font>

613
00:36:41,114 --> 00:36:42,774
<font color="yellow">Why are you being chased?</font>

614
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,084
<font color="yellow">You don't have to know.</font>

615
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:50,944
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thanks for saving me twice.</font>

616
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,374
<font color="yellow">You even got kissed.</font>

617
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:58,444
<font color="yellow">Thinking about that day...</font>

618
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,344
<font color="yellow">makes me laugh.</font>

619
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:19,514
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

620
00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:21,314
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

621
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,243
<font color="yellow">- A girlfriend?
- Yes.</font>

622
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:33,913
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a girlfriend, right?</font>

623
00:37:33,914 --> 00:37:36,813
<font color="yellow">He never had one and he
probably doesn't have one now.</font>

624
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,414
<font color="yellow">He's only been trained to marry
a girl from a rich family.</font>

625
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:41,643
<font color="yellow">- All right.
- Why do you ask?</font>

626
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,413
<font color="yellow">He should get married.</font>

627
00:37:43,414 --> 00:37:46,313
<font color="yellow">I'll find a nice girl from a good family...</font>

628
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:47,474
<font color="yellow">and make Soo Jo marry her.</font>

629
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:51,874
<font color="yellow">Should I buy you dinner as a thank you?</font>

630
00:37:52,474 --> 00:37:53,943
<font color="yellow">You work as a driver at night.</font>

631
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:55,744
<font color="yellow">I'll have a quick dinner.</font>

632
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:02,143
<font color="yellow">- Come here.
- Run away.</font>

633
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:03,814
<font color="yellow">- Come here.
- Come here.</font>

634
00:38:07,874 --> 00:38:09,044
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

635
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,084
<font color="yellow">What are you?</font>

636
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:22,374
<font color="yellow">- Darn...
- Who the heck are you?</font>

637
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:36,444
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

638
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:43,583
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

639
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:45,584
<font color="yellow">Bring it quickly!</font>

640
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:47,714
<font color="yellow">I'm coming.</font>

641
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,673
<font color="yellow">Who did this to you?</font>

642
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,143
<font color="yellow">I'll beat him up.</font>

643
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,343
<font color="yellow">I bumped into something at work.</font>

644
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:55,584
<font color="yellow">At work?</font>

645
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:57,644
<font color="yellow">Why do you do that kind of work?</font>

646
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:00,474
<font color="yellow">What will we do with your face?</font>

647
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,714
<font color="yellow">You should stop working at the warehouse.</font>

648
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,443
<font color="yellow">- No.
- If being a director is too much,</font>

649
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,043
<font color="yellow">how about working at a store?</font>

650
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,243
<font color="yellow">It's close to home and it's not hard work.</font>

651
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:10,743
<font color="yellow">I won't do anything other
than warehouse work.</font>

652
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:13,244
<font color="yellow">Since when have you been so
attached to the warehouse?</font>

653
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:15,474
<font color="yellow">What will we do with the bruise?</font>

654
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:21,294
<font color="yellow">You didn't brush your teeth, did you?</font>

655
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:23,544
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

656
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,643
<font color="yellow">A very small car</font>

657
00:39:28,644 --> 00:39:31,643
<font color="yellow">A tiny car is driving</font>

658
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:32,714
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

659
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:42,143
<font color="yellow">Look at you eating a corn dog and
carrying around a grocery basket.</font>

660
00:40:42,144 --> 00:40:44,373
<font color="yellow">All you do is stay at home...</font>

661
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:46,143
<font color="yellow">and nag at your son-in-law.</font>

662
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,744
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What a jerk.</font>

663
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,543
<font color="yellow">A security guard?</font>

664
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:01,614
<font color="yellow">I feel bad doing nothing at home.</font>

665
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:03,374
<font color="yellow">I need some more pocket money.</font>

666
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,243
<font color="yellow">I should work.</font>

667
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:06,974
<font color="yellow">Did you forget?</font>

668
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:08,943
<font color="yellow">You worked as a guard for three months...</font>

669
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,584
<font color="yellow">after losing your severance pay.</font>

670
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:14,043
<font color="yellow">You got looked down on by the tenants...</font>

671
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:16,243
<font color="yellow">and went through so much. Do
you want to do that again?</font>

672
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:17,773
<font color="yellow">Not all places are like that.</font>

673
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:20,044
<font color="yellow">People even treated you like a thief.</font>

674
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,083
<font color="yellow">You kept bringing food that wasn't edible.</font>

675
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:25,644
<font color="yellow">I told you to quit because
I didn't like that.</font>

676
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:28,084
<font color="yellow">Back then, when we went out,</font>

677
00:41:28,374 --> 00:41:31,144
<font color="yellow">people thought I was your older sister.
But look now.</font>

678
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:32,844
<font color="yellow">You've gotten so old.</font>

679
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:34,974
<font color="yellow">They think you're my father.</font>

680
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:38,444
<font color="yellow">Nobody thinks that far.</font>

681
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:41,214
<font color="yellow">Don't be a guard. Just stay home.</font>

682
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:47,084
<font color="yellow">I think he'll get ill.</font>

683
00:41:47,314 --> 00:41:48,643
<font color="yellow">He won't eat anything.</font>

684
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:50,473
<font color="yellow">He needs to eat.</font>

685
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,143
<font color="yellow">What if he collapses?</font>

686
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:53,943
<font color="yellow">Didn't he have anything for dinner?</font>

687
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,913
<font color="yellow">He had a bit of porridge.</font>

688
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,944
<font color="yellow">I asked him what he wanted
but he won't answer.</font>

689
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:04,144
<font color="yellow">I heard you didn't eat.</font>

690
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:09,213
<font color="yellow">Sir, tell me what you want to eat.
I'll cook it for you.</font>

691
00:42:09,214 --> 00:42:11,344
<font color="yellow">He's asking you what you want.</font>

692
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:14,873
<font color="yellow">Do you not like what I cook?</font>

693
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:17,514
<font color="yellow">People who cook always make what they like.</font>

694
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,443
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit my taste.</font>

695
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:22,044
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I keep following my palate.</font>

696
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:24,243
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you want to eat.</font>

697
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:26,044
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I want to eat.</font>

698
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:28,374
<font color="yellow">- You can go.
- Okay.</font>

699
00:42:32,044 --> 00:42:34,084
<font color="yellow">Dad. Why are you like this?</font>

700
00:42:34,744 --> 00:42:37,390
<font color="yellow">You said you'd end it. Why
didn't you get over it yet?</font>

701
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:40,313
<font color="yellow">You're doing this on
purpose to make me upset.</font>

702
00:42:40,314 --> 00:42:43,083
<font color="yellow">- It's not like that.
- Then what is it?</font>

703
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:45,113
<font color="yellow">Do you want to be carried to a hospital?</font>

704
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:47,114
<font color="yellow">I'm tired. Stop talking and get out.</font>

705
00:42:58,114 --> 00:42:59,594
<font color="yellow">You said you stopped delivering milk.</font>

706
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,543
<font color="yellow">I should do it until
they find a replacement.</font>

707
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:05,013
<font color="yellow">- You're doing this on purpose.
- What?</font>

708
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:07,873
<font color="yellow">You're doing this because I'm not
letting you see that old man.</font>

709
00:43:07,874 --> 00:43:09,644
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you about this.</font>

710
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:11,774
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

711
00:43:12,514 --> 00:43:14,943
<font color="yellow">You hurt your son's pride,
so stop it already.</font>

712
00:43:14,944 --> 00:43:17,144
<font color="yellow">Did I have to hear those
words from that woman?</font>

713
00:43:17,814 --> 00:43:19,844
<font color="yellow">Do you know how crushed I was?</font>

714
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:22,544
<font color="yellow">I'm your retirement plan.</font>

715
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:24,743
<font color="yellow">I'll do everything,</font>

716
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:26,914
<font color="yellow">so don't get seduced by any old man.</font>

717
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:40,244
<font color="yellow">Mum! Big news!</font>

718
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:45,644
<font color="yellow">Was Gab Soon here?</font>

719
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:48,013
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon's mother-in-law...</font>

720
00:43:48,014 --> 00:43:50,243
<font color="yellow">got caught dating.</font>

721
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:53,344
<font color="yellow">- What?
- She was dating a rich, old man...</font>

722
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:56,013
<font color="yellow">but they broke up because his
children didn't approve.</font>

723
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:58,374
<font color="yellow">That's why she's upset these days.</font>

724
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,744
<font color="yellow">That's why she was like that.</font>

725
00:44:01,114 --> 00:44:03,613
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that. I feel sorry now.</font>

726
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:04,843
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

727
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:06,913
<font color="yellow">What? It's nothing.</font>

728
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:08,713
<font color="yellow">She looked like...</font>

729
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:11,043
<font color="yellow">she wouldn't date anyone
after her husband died.</font>

730
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,774
<font color="yellow">Who knew she'd be dating?</font>

731
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:15,643
<font color="yellow">She probably seduced him
because he was rich.</font>

732
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:18,644
<font color="yellow">Even if he's rich, he's so old.</font>

733
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:21,543
<font color="yellow">She's been living alone all this time.
Why would she...</font>

734
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:23,073
<font color="yellow">date a corpse-to-be?</font>

735
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:25,843
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- I'm right.</font>

736
00:44:25,844 --> 00:44:29,514
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't cook and do
laundry for some old man.</font>

737
00:44:29,874 --> 00:44:31,434
<font color="yellow">She should just live alone comfortably.</font>

738
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:33,443
<font color="yellow">It's because she's lonely.</font>

739
00:44:33,444 --> 00:44:35,143
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

740
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:38,114
<font color="yellow">You get really lonely when you get old.</font>

741
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:40,843
<font color="yellow">You get lonelier when it gets cold.</font>

742
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,913
<font color="yellow">You should just be happy with
your children and grandchildren.</font>

743
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,614
<font color="yellow">I don't understand...</font>

744
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,244
<font color="yellow">old people who get married again.</font>

745
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,774
<font color="yellow">I'd understand if they
were married since young.</font>

746
00:44:51,044 --> 00:44:52,844
<font color="yellow">It's all case by case.</font>

747
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:56,244
<font color="yellow">She lived alone this long
so she should get married.</font>

748
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:01,113
<font color="yellow">Since you lived with my
brother your entire life,</font>

749
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:02,374
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't understand.</font>

750
00:45:02,514 --> 00:45:04,474
<font color="yellow">During the middle of the night,</font>

751
00:45:04,644 --> 00:45:08,844
<font color="yellow">you wake up but you don't find
any warmth under the blanket.</font>

752
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:11,314
<font color="yellow">How would you know about loneliness?</font>

753
00:45:11,414 --> 00:45:13,544
<font color="yellow">Why would you be lonely

754
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:17,614

something under the blanket.</font>

755

757
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:06,544
<font color="yellow">Did they disapprove?</font>

758
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:08,114

759
00:46:08,844 --> 00:46:10,774
<font color="yellow">Kids are all selfish.</font>

760
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:12,974
<font color="yellow">They should be the ones to find someone.</font>

761
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:14,844
<font color="yellow">They do as they wish.</font>

762
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:17,814
<font color="yellow">Kids are like that.</font>

763
00:46:17,914 --> 00:46:20,144
<font color="yellow">Can children make their
parents feel less lonely?</font>

764
00:46:20,574 --> 00:46:22,674
<font color="yellow">Children and grandchildren
have their limits.</font>

765
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:26,714
<font color="yellow">They shouldn't feel embarrassed
about their parents.</font>

766
00:46:27,544 --> 00:46:30,814
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol is still immature.</font>

767
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:34,374
<font color="yellow">Should I talk to him about it?</font>

768
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:36,613
<font color="yellow">The other family disapproved.</font>

769
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,344
<font color="yellow">It's all over.</font>

770
00:46:38,744 --> 00:46:41,014
<font color="yellow">You'll leave Gab Soon in a tough spot.
Leave it.</font>

771
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:44,814
<font color="yellow">She has a lot of years ahead. She
should get married if she can.</font>

772
00:46:44,944 --> 00:46:49,114
<font color="yellow">I heard he's old. I wonder how rich
he is that his family disapproved.</font>

773
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:52,074
<font color="yellow">No matter how their old
parents live their lives,</font>

774
00:46:52,514 --> 00:46:54,244
<font color="yellow">children shouldn't meddle.</font>

775
00:46:54,574 --> 00:46:56,174
<font color="yellow">He might have his money taken.</font>

776
00:46:56,874 --> 00:47:00,514
<font color="yellow">They're worried that he'll
return to them penniless.</font>

777
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:02,944
<font color="yellow">You should think about how
the children may feel.</font>

778
00:47:03,514 --> 00:47:05,974
<font color="yellow">You heard about Doo Shim's father-in-law.</font>

779
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,513
<font color="yellow">He remarried a woman 10
years younger than him.</font>

780
00:47:08,514 --> 00:47:12,244
<font color="yellow">They lived for three years and the
woman ran away with all his money.</font>

781
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:14,574
<font color="yellow">You can't blame the kids.</font>

782
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:16,674
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to remarry?</font>

783
00:47:16,774 --> 00:47:18,644
<font color="yellow">Aren't you still a person
even if you're old?</font>

784
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:21,844
<font color="yellow">It's only the body that aged.
Your feelings stay the same.</font>

785
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,044
<font color="yellow">Someone I know wanted to marry.</font>

786
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:27,774
<font color="yellow">His children disapproved so he couldn't.</font>

787
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:30,944
<font color="yellow">He got ill and old. He
is in a hospital now.</font>

788
00:47:31,044 --> 00:47:32,244
<font color="yellow">Was he rich?</font>

789
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:36,614
<font color="yellow">He had a pretty spacious flat.</font>

790
00:47:36,974 --> 00:47:38,914
<font color="yellow">He also had pension.</font>

791
00:47:39,144 --> 00:47:42,490
<font color="yellow">His children made such
a big deal about that.</font>

792
00:47:42,514 --> 00:47:43,674
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

793
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:49,414
<font color="yellow">Children with parents who aren't
rich worry about who'd take them.</font>

794
00:47:49,714 --> 00:47:53,574
<font color="yellow">Children with rich parents worry
that they'll get married.</font>

795
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:56,474
<font color="yellow">Money is the best.</font>

796
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:02,874
<font color="yellow">She doesn't seem charming to me.</font>

797
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:05,714
<font color="yellow">How did she attract a rich guy?</font>

798
00:48:06,074 --> 00:48:09,114
<font color="yellow">He must have no taste.</font>

799
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:12,074
<font color="yellow">Do you think she's all right?</font>

800
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:13,950
<font color="yellow">Is she charming as a woman?</font>

801
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,490
<font color="yellow">How can I see her as a woman?</font>

802
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:19,544
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying. How is she objectively?</font>

803
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:21,444
<font color="yellow">Do men like women like her?</font>

804
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:24,274
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk
about family like that.</font>

805
00:48:24,974 --> 00:48:26,674
<font color="yellow">What kind of women do you like?</font>

806
00:48:28,744 --> 00:48:29,844
<font color="yellow">Women that I've met first.</font>

807
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:35,674
<font color="yellow">Let's say that we're both single.</font>

808
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:38,550
<font color="yellow">Someone introduced us two at a coffee shop.</font>

809
00:48:38,574 --> 00:48:40,944
<font color="yellow">I entered the cafe.</font>

810

00:48:44,974 --> 00:48:46,590

- Yes.</font>

813
00:48:46,614 --> 00:48:48,714
<font color="yellow">Then I'll be happy than ever.</font>

814

819
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:04,544

820
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,244
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'd remarry.</font>

not a big deal for me.</font>

before, I'd feel awkward and weird.</font>

826
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:31,790

about that. How can I live with him?</font>

00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,774
<font color="yellow">I dropped by my house but said nothing.</font>

900
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:08,344
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

901
00:54:13,414 --> 00:54:15,714
<font color="yellow">Let's leave our worries aside.</font>

902
00:54:16,674 --> 00:54:17,744
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

903
00:54:20,244 --> 00:54:21,444
<font color="yellow">Do you have money?</font>

904
00:54:22,744 --> 00:54:24,144
<font color="yellow">Don't belittle me.</font>

905
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:27,914
<font color="yellow">I've worked as a doctor at a
university hospital for years.</font>

906
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:30,544
<font color="yellow">I was a son-in-law of a wealthy
family for over a year.</font>

907
00:54:30,744 --> 00:54:32,744
<font color="yellow">Don't joke about your wounds.</font>

908
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,244
<font color="yellow">I paid earlier.</font>

909
00:55:03,214 --> 00:55:04,374
<font color="yellow">You should go home.</font>

910
00:55:05,314 --> 00:55:06,813
<font color="yellow">I should walk you home.</font>

911
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:09,243
<font color="yellow">I'm worried a girl who'd buy
you rice would take you.</font>

912
00:55:09,244 --> 00:55:12,114
<font color="yellow">Are you making a move with the side dishes?</font>

913
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:15,614
<font color="yellow">I'll eat up and gain weight.</font>

914
00:55:30,014 --> 00:55:31,014
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

915
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:32,973
<font color="yellow">I have money.</font>

916
00:55:32,974 --> 00:55:34,774
<font color="yellow">I can spend this much.</font>

917
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:36,714
<font color="yellow">Please drive her home safely.</font>

918
00:55:37,674 --> 00:55:38,714
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

919
00:55:42,044 --> 00:55:43,314
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

920
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,244
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik?</font>

921
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:50,174
<font color="yellow">Hi. What brings you here?</font>

922
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,944
<font color="yellow">It's been a while. Take a seat.</font>

923
00:56:55,314 --> 00:56:56,844
<font color="yellow">- Are you alone?
- Yes.</font>

924
00:56:57,444 --> 00:57:00,414
<font color="yellow">- Are you with someone?
- No.</font>

925
00:57:01,774 --> 00:57:04,014
<font color="yellow">- We'll have a bottle of soju.
- Okay.</font>

926
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:10,243
<font color="yellow">You're eating without food.
Should we have some?</font>

927
00:57:10,244 --> 00:57:12,244
<font color="yellow">Order anything you want.</font>

928
00:57:13,174 --> 00:57:15,444
<font color="yellow">- We'll have some soup.
- Okay.</font>

929
00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:27,644
<font color="yellow">You must be having a tough time.</font>

930
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:35,544
<font color="yellow">I'm fine as long as your sister's happy.</font>

931
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:37,474
<font color="yellow">I understand her.</font>

932
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:43,474
<font color="yellow">I felt bad and upset but I
guess this is my limit.</font>

933
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:46,874
<font color="yellow">Men are like that.</font>

934
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:50,774
<font color="yellow">We feel hopeless when we can't
do everything for our women.</font>

935
00:57:51,074 --> 00:57:52,944
<font color="yellow">When you can't be confident,</font>

936
00:57:54,214 --> 00:57:55,674
<font color="yellow">you feel ugly.</font>

937
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:57,844
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

938
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:01,774
<font color="yellow">Not being able to take
her by the hand and say,</font>

939
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:04,544
<font color="yellow">"I'll take care of you,"</font>

940
00:58:06,444 --> 00:58:07,844
<font color="yellow">feels terrible.</font>

941
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:11,814
<font color="yellow">I know how it feels.</font>

942
00:58:14,614 --> 00:58:15,974
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

943
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:20,174
<font color="yellow">Where to?</font>

944
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:22,143
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

945
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,174
<font color="yellow">Why are you alone? What about Se Gye?</font>

946
00:58:24,644 --> 00:58:26,244
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

947
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:33,973
<font color="yellow">Leaving our child aside,</font>

948
00:58:33,974 --> 00:58:36,843
<font color="yellow">are you confident that we'll
be able to live as a couple...</font>

949
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:38,014
<font color="yellow">while trusting each other?</font>

950
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:41,044
<font color="yellow">I don't see you as a man.</font>

951
00:59:16,544 --> 00:59:19,714
<font color="yellow">Mr Jo, let's have a talk.</font>

952
00:59:21,714 --> 00:59:23,813
<font color="yellow">- I called earlier.
- Yes, Boss.</font>

953
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:26,573
<font color="yellow">I arranged the best room here.</font>

954
00:59:26,574 --> 00:59:28,173
<font color="yellow">It's all ready.</font>

955
00:59:28,174 --> 00:59:29,914
<font color="yellow">Please come in.</font>

956
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:32,144
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

957
00:59:36,344 --> 00:59:38,174
<font color="yellow">Please take a seat.</font>

958
00:59:42,814 --> 00:59:44,874
<font color="yellow">I've arranged what you usually have, Boss.</font>

959
00:59:46,944 --> 00:59:48,814
<font color="yellow">There are also beautiful ladies waiting.</font>

960
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:51,344
<font color="yellow">Please leave us be. We have to talk.</font>

961
00:59:53,474 --> 00:59:55,974
<font color="yellow">- Wait outside.
- Yes, Boss.</font>

962
01:00:01,814 --> 01:00:03,544
<font color="yellow">You must've drunk already.</font>

963
01:00:05,014 --> 01:00:06,244
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

964
01:00:07,214 --> 01:00:10,114
<font color="yellow">We decided to get back together.</font>

965
01:00:12,144 --> 01:00:14,673
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for you.</font>

966
01:00:14,674 --> 01:00:17,644
<font color="yellow">I also have something to ask.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.</font>

967
01:00:20,914 --> 01:00:23,344
<font color="yellow">Why did you remarry?</font>

968
01:00:24,074 --> 01:00:25,243
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

969
01:00:25,244 --> 01:00:28,674
<font color="yellow">They say they had no choice
because you paid their debt.</font>

970
01:00:30,414 --> 01:00:34,174
<font color="yellow">You must have remarried as it's hard
to live alone with your children.</font>

971
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:37,674
<font color="yellow">Things have changed now.</font>

972
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:39,674
<font color="yellow">You should let it go.</font>

973
01:00:41,544 --> 01:00:44,174
<font color="yellow">Thank you for being so considerate.</font>

974
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,644
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for you.</font>

975
01:00:52,574 --> 01:00:55,974
<font color="yellow">It's not like us to be mushy.</font>

976
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:03,014
<font color="yellow">She has a husband...</font>

977
01:01:03,374 --> 01:01:05,574
<font color="yellow">but you had the nerve to
come to the hospital.</font>

978
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:09,574
<font color="yellow">She's over you...</font>

979
01:01:10,074 --> 01:01:12,374
<font color="yellow">but you haven't cleaned up your mess yet.</font>

980
01:01:13,414 --> 01:01:16,044
<font color="yellow">It seems like I'm older than you.</font>

981
01:01:16,914 --> 01:01:18,314
<font color="yellow">You should listen to me.</font>

982
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:23,874
<font color="yellow">As men, let's settle this.</font>

983
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,644
<font color="yellow">Let's bring in the ladies.</font>

984
01:01:27,644 --> 01:01:28,914
<font color="yellow">Let's have fun.</font>

985
01:01:29,444 --> 01:01:30,474
<font color="yellow">Hey, there!</font>

986
01:01:31,374 --> 01:01:32,674
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

987
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,614
<font color="yellow">About the ladies...</font>

988
01:01:35,674 --> 01:01:38,644
<font color="yellow">Bring in the best you have here...</font>

989
01:01:39,574 --> 01:01:40,574
<font color="yellow">right now.</font>

990
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:43,074
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Boss.
- Wait.</font>

991
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,013
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

992
01:01:45,014 --> 01:01:47,614
<font color="yellow">I think we're done talking.</font>

993
01:01:47,844 --> 01:01:49,044
<font color="yellow">I'll bring them over.</font>

994
01:01:49,674 --> 01:01:50,944
<font color="yellow">I told you, get out.</font>

995
01:02:02,114 --> 01:02:04,013
<font color="yellow">You should take your time.</font>

996
01:02:04,014 --> 01:02:05,974
<font color="yellow">Did they say she married
because I paid her debt?</font>

997
01:02:06,214 --> 01:02:08,114
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- That's right.</font>

998
01:02:09,014 --> 01:02:11,943
<font color="yellow">As a woman who was in debt
because of her ex-husband,</font>

999
01:02:11,944 --> 01:02:14,074
<font color="yellow">she must have lost her head
when she met a rich man.</font>

1000
01:02:15,244 --> 01:02:16,314
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

1001
01:02:17,314 --> 01:02:20,514
<font color="yellow">do you think money is all
there is to marriage?</font>

1002
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:23,573
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I should say this,</font>

1003
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:25,174
<font color="yellow">but she confessed later.</font>

1004
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:27,774
<font color="yellow">That she fell in love
with me at first sight.</font>

1005
01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:30,144
<font color="yellow">That she never felt like that before.</font>

1006
01:02:35,044 --> 01:02:37,074
<font color="yellow">I'm quite popular among women.</font>

1007
01:02:37,874 --> 01:02:39,674
<font color="yellow">I'm tall and sturdy.</font>

1008
01:02:40,374 --> 01:02:41,944
<font color="yellow">I have a great bottom.</font>

1009
01:02:46,344 --> 01:02:48,844
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What a waste of
an expensive liquor.</font>

1010
01:02:50,744 --> 01:02:52,014
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know more?</font>

1011
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,443
<font color="yellow">When we lived together,</font>

1012
01:02:54,444 --> 01:02:57,574
<font color="yellow">she always took care of
herself in front of me.</font>

1013
01:02:58,044 --> 01:02:59,544
<font color="yellow">She woke up earlier than me.</font>

1014
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:01,414
<font color="yellow">She slept later than me.</font>

1015
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:04,514
<font color="yellow">I've never seen...</font>

1016
01:03:05,674 --> 01:03:07,374
<font color="yellow">her face without makeup on.</font>

1017
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:11,173
<font color="yellow">If a woman wants to look good for a man,</font>

1018
01:03:11,174 --> 01:03:12,473
<font color="yellow">I heard that's what they do.</font>

1019
01:03:12,474 --> 01:03:14,444
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

1020
01:03:14,774 --> 01:03:16,844
<font color="yellow">she loved sleeping with
my arm under her head.</font>

1021
01:03:17,914 --> 01:03:19,644
<font color="yellow">We never slept separately.</font>

1022
01:03:21,944 --> 01:03:23,814
<font color="yellow">I heard she wasn't like that with her ex.</font>

1023
01:03:29,174 --> 01:03:30,444
<font color="yellow">Drink slowly...</font>

1024
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:32,674
<font color="yellow">if you're going to enjoy yourself.</font>

1025
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:41,574
<font color="yellow">Whatever your name is,</font>

1026
01:03:42,174 --> 01:03:43,514
<font color="yellow">as you said,</font>

1027
01:03:44,214 --> 01:03:47,544
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon can be swayed easily,
but you should know this.</font>

1028
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:50,874
<font color="yellow">If she really wants to,</font>

1029
01:03:52,674 --> 01:03:54,374
<font color="yellow">she takes control.</font>

1030
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:00,774
<font color="yellow">Hey, there.</font>

1031
01:04:03,614 --> 01:04:04,873
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

1032
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,044
<font color="yellow">Do you call everyone that?</font>

1033
01:04:06,644 --> 01:04:08,574
<font color="yellow">Bring your best girls in.</font>

1034
01:04:10,074 --> 01:04:12,344
<font color="yellow">Mr Jeon here is going to enjoy himself.</font>
