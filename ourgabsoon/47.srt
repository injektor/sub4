<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 47)</font>

3
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:23,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Sir. Where would you like to go?</font>

4
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me one thing.</font>

5
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,118
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why did you run away? - It's because...</font>

6
00:00:55,648 --> 00:00:56,678
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't pay that money back.</font>

7
00:00:56,778 --> 00:00:58,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you intend to deceive me from the beginning?</font>

8
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:00,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me!</font>

9
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:03,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you intend to deceive me from the beginning?</font>

10
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:08,348
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

11
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't intend to deceive you.</font>

12
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:14,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Seeing the money made me insane.</font>

13
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:17,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never touched such big money.</font>

14
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:21,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't have time to think about you. I wanted to live first.</font>

15
00:01:22,678 --> 00:01:26,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I can barely afford my living by working all month.</font>

16
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:30,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I don't go to a movie or buy myself a cup of coffee,</font>

17
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:31,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't save up that much money.</font>

18
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,348
<font color=#FFFF00>The cake you gave me was the first cake I ever tasted.</font>

19
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:41,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to pay off my debt with the 30,000 dollars.</font>

20
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,618
<font color=#FFFF00>However, with that money,</font>

21
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I could go to a small suburb...</font>

22
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:51,118
<font color=#FFFF00>and open up a small store.</font>

23
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:54,618
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what popped up in my head.</font>

24
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:58,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why didn't you go?</font>

25
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:02,278
<font color=#FFFF00>I paid off my debt.</font>

26
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I got caught even before I ran away.</font>

27
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:13,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Hit me. Hit me until your rage is gone.</font>

28
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I deserve to be beaten up.</font>

29
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:19,578
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have told me.</font>

30
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:22,218
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't even know your number.</font>

31
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:25,118
<font color=#FFFF00>I was shivering like a dog all day long in front of the park.</font>

32
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,788
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't play with my heart.</font>

33
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:32,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pay back the money no matter what it takes.</font>

34
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,078
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need it.</font>

35
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:36,618
<font color=#FFFF00>That petty 30,000 dollars.</font>

36
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:38,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Take it and don't come around again.</font>

37
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:43,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to bump into someone like you ever again.</font>

38
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:48,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't mean to deceive you. Trust me.</font>

39
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I had my reason.</font>

40
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:51,848
<font color=#FFFF00>What reason?</font>

41
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,778
<font color=#FFFF00>In fact, I...</font>

42
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:06,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

43
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:08,678
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

44
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:15,278
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Hospital?</font>

45
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,348
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, I'll be right there.</font>

46
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:23,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, dear! My goodness!</font>

47
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Taxi!</font>

48
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:35,578
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ma'am! - Ji Ha.</font>

49
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,718
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened? What's the matter with my babies?</font>

50
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:38,818
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

51
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I was giving them formula but they kept vomiting.</font>

52
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:43,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, what is wrong?</font>

53
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:44,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Will they be all right?</font>

54
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:47,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's acute indigestion. I'll take a look for a while.</font>

55
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:50,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you're here, I'll get going.</font>

56
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:51,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I left the other kids alone.</font>

57
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead. Thank you.</font>

58
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:58,178
<font color=#FFFF00>First, pat on their backs so they can burp.</font>

59
00:03:58,318 --> 00:03:59,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Mommy's here.</font>

60
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, do the same thing.</font>

61
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:14,918
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do it gently.</font>

62
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess your husband doesn't usually help you.</font>

63
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... No...</font>

64
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,878
<font color=#FFFF00>Your call is being forwarded to a voicemail system...</font>

65
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:30,978
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not picking up.</font>

66
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:34,278
<font color=#FFFF00>They said he got off work much earlier. I wonder if something's up.</font>

67
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:37,088
<font color=#FFFF00>This has never happened before. It's strange.</font>

68
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:20,348
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be surprised.</font>

69
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:24,278
<font color=#FFFF00>About the reason I mentioned earlier...</font>

70
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,118
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have to explain that, right?</font>

71
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:31,818
<font color=#FFFF00>This is who I am.</font>

72
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:37,278
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why I keep owing you...</font>

73
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,918
<font color=#FFFF00>since we first met.</font>

74
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:52,078
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you owed me in our past lives.</font>

75
00:05:58,218 --> 00:06:01,148
<font color=#FFFF00>You were the first person who believed in me.</font>

76
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:05,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew how things were for you.</font>

77
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:09,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how you must've gotten such a large sum of money.</font>

78
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:13,818
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've saved money while you gave up...</font>

79
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:17,218
<font color=#FFFF00>eating or buying nice things.</font>

80
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure I pay you back...</font>

81
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:24,178
<font color=#FFFF00>such valuable money.</font>

82
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:26,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give me some time.</font>

83
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,548
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm home. - You're late.</font>

84
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been? You didn't answer your phone.</font>

85
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:05,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Is everything okay?</font>

86
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not a child.</font>

87
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:08,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I have things to do privately.</font>

88
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,218
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still a child to me.</font>

89
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:12,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you had dinner? Should I set the table?</font>

90
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:13,218
<font color=#FFFF00>I ate.</font>

91
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:15,018
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll go upstairs. - Okay.</font>

92
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:21,848
<font color=#FFFF00>He seems to be fine. You should go to bed now.</font>

93
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:23,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I envy you.</font>

94
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:26,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to stroke his face like you do.</font>

95
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:34,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Have Se Bang's property under your name...</font>

96
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,618
<font color=#FFFF00>and save some money for yourself.</font>

97
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:39,318
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have some spare money.</font>

98
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,678
<font color=#FFFF00>You used to have no money for yourself.</font>

99
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't live like that any more.</font>

100
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,378
<font color=#FFFF00>You never know what's going to happen.</font>

101
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:48,178
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

102
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:50,618
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how it is to run your own business.</font>

103
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:55,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Something might go wrong or you may get involved in a bad incident.</font>

104
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:57,678
<font color=#FFFF00>I would leave him, then.</font>

105
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going to stay with him if it's too hard for me.</font>

106
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:05,078
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh.</font>

107
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,048
<font color=#FFFF00>You were married to him once. You don't have to try to impress him...</font>

108
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,918
<font color=#FFFF00>with these things.</font>

109
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

110
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:16,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

111
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:19,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't divorce him again and marry someone else.</font>

112
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:21,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a happy life with him.</font>

113
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:23,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch your words.</font>

114
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm already being careful with my words.</font>

115
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:30,178
<font color=#FFFF00>If I say what I really want to say, it's going to hurt...</font>

116
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,878
<font color=#FFFF00>many people including Jae Soon.</font>

117
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:34,948
<font color=#FFFF00>What is she talking about?</font>

118
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't mind her. She always spoils the mood with her words.</font>

119
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:40,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to do that to your niece who is getting married soon?</font>

120
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:42,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I really hate you.</font>

121
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:45,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt. After I get married, it'll be just you and Mum,</font>

122
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,278
<font color=#FFFF00>so be good to her.</font>

123
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,378
<font color=#FFFF00>She's been worried about you her whole life. Don't you feel bad?</font>

124
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:54,248
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh. Are you lecturing me now?</font>

125
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:57,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful if you don't want to be lectured by your niece.</font>

126
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:01,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum practically raised Dal Pa, and you're still living in her house.</font>

127
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:03,248
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you be so shameless?</font>

128
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:06,018
<font color=#FFFF00>You two are ganging up on me.</font>

129
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:08,348
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the one who said unnecessary things.</font>

130
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:12,318
<font color=#FFFF00>If you give Mum a hard time, I won't stand it.</font>

131
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:14,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mouth always causes trouble.</font>

132
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:17,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Get up.</font>

133
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:23,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that too much?</font>

134
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:25,048
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I do?</font>

135
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:28,548
<font color=#FFFF00>You know my mum gets stressed by Aunt.</font>

136
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so, she's older than you.</font>

137
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so rude to her.</font>

138
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:35,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mum deserved it. You can't blame us for this.</font>

139
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,048
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough, Aunt.</font>

140
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Listen to him.</font>

141
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:42,848
<font color=#FFFF00>He said, "That's enough."</font>

142
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:45,948
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't seem to care about her, but he's siding with her now.</font>

143
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:48,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Who does he think raised him?</font>

144
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:50,848
<font color=#FFFF00>They say you shouldn't raise someone else's child.</font>

145
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,218
<font color=#FFFF00>This is exactly why.</font>

146
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay here for a while and go back in when Aunt is less angry.</font>

147
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

148
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch your words from now on.</font>

149
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

150
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch out for cars and don't skip meals.</font>

151
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:28,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he really your nephew?</font>

152
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:31,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come here again?</font>

153
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't give me your number.</font>

154
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:35,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no choice but to come.</font>

155
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,248
<font color=#FFFF00>My neck hurts from looking up at your window for so long.</font>

156
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:41,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he really your nephew?</font>

157
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you dating him?</font>

158
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:46,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you I have nothing to say to you.</font>

159
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go somewhere and talk.</font>

160
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:51,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me go.</font>

161
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go straight to the office.</font>

162
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:55,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me go! I have nothing to say to you!</font>

163
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:56,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Come with me.</font>

164
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:58,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I said, let me go!</font>

165
00:10:58,778 --> 00:10:59,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

166
00:11:00,148 --> 00:11:01,318
<font color=#FFFF00>That jerk.</font>

167
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, let go of me!</font>

168
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:06,278
<font color=#FFFF00>No! Don't hit him, Dal Pa!</font>

169
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:12,618
<font color=#FFFF00>He might ask you for money if you hit him.</font>

170
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,648
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not even worth punching.</font>

171
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:21,378
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you doing? Who are you?</font>

172
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and go.</font>

173
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:25,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi. You're Mal Nyeon's nephew.</font>

174
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:27,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not a bad man.</font>

175
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Just go.</font>

176
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,548
<font color=#FFFF00>See you again soon.</font>

177
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:38,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is he?</font>

178
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:39,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Nobody.</font>

179
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does he think I'm your nephew?</font>

180
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you still do this with men?</font>

181
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,718
<font color=#FFFF00>My name is Shin Joong Nyeon. I'm 64 years old.</font>

182
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:20,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I retired from work...</font>

183
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:24,018
<font color=#FFFF00>about six years ago.</font>

184
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,618
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're a middle-aged man,</font>

185
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:30,518
<font color=#FFFF00>you have to take care of your own meals. If you don't,</font>

186
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:31,648
<font color=#FFFF00>your wife will nag you.</font>

187
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,618
<font color=#FFFF00>It's hard for you to be working in your 60s.</font>

188
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,448
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't want to be kicked out of the house,</font>

189
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:42,948
<font color=#FFFF00>take care of your own meals and do the dishes afterwards.</font>

190
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:45,348
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough to make your wife happy.</font>

191
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:49,578
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't make you less of a man to hang around in the kitchen.</font>

192
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:52,178
<font color=#FFFF00>If it does, that's too bad.</font>

193
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:54,948
<font color=#FFFF00>From my experience,</font>

194
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:58,048
<font color=#FFFF00>kimchi fried rice is the easiest one to make.</font>

195
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:03,548
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll need kimchi, rice, ham...</font>

196
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:06,418
<font color=#FFFF00>and a frying pan. That's all.</font>

197
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:08,848
<font color=#FFFF00>First of all,</font>

198
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:11,548
<font color=#FFFF00>please cut...</font>

199
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,548
<font color=#FFFF00>the kimchi.</font>

200
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,118
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

201
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:24,318
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why I placed a plastic cover on the floor.</font>

202
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I spilled it before,</font>

203
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:30,648
<font color=#FFFF00>and it was so tiresome to clean it.</font>

204
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, when you open the ham,</font>

205
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:38,718
<font color=#FFFF00>focus on the sense of your hands.</font>

206
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:42,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Open it at once.</font>

207
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:45,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Like this.</font>

208
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I was worried that I might make a mistake.</font>

209
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:54,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I once dropped the ham on the floor while shaking it to get it out.</font>

210
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:56,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Just take a knife...</font>

211
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,948
<font color=#FFFF00>and get it out like this.</font>

212
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:03,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Here it is.</font>

213
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:05,848
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so easy, right?</font>

214
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:14,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Dal Pa. Dal Pa!</font>

215
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:18,818
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it, Uncle?</font>

216
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:22,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you upload this? I made a video,</font>

217
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:23,518
<font color=#FFFF00>but it's hard to upload it.</font>

218
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:25,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now?</font>

219
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You gave steamed ones to Se Bang but torn ones to Gab Dol.</font>

220
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:36,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't treat them differently, Mum. It upset Gab Dol.</font>

221
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:44,548
<font color=#FFFF00>See? You're glad you listened to me, right?</font>

222
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:46,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

223
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:49,448
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not married, but you're good at this.</font>

224
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:52,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Feel free to ask me any questions.</font>

225
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

226
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:00,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Mother.</font>

227
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,178
<font color=#FFFF00>In the evening?</font>

228
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:05,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

229
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:16,018
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Are you making dumplings again?</font>

230
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Someone didn't have enough dumplings.</font>

231
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:21,548
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who? - Just someone.</font>

232
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:23,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you have to pack for the honeymoon?</font>

233
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,148
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

234
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:33,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Jeon. You can't go somewhere far for a while.</font>

235
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:34,778
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to Hawaii.</font>

236
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:37,048
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't leave the country.</font>

237
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:40,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay put until we resolve this matter.</font>

238
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:43,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just a testifier. Why do you keep calling me here? My gosh.</font>

239
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:51,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang.</font>

240
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang!</font>

241
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,178
<font color=#FFFF00>(Seoul Police Station)</font>

242
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,148
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you finish packing? - Almost.</font>

243
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish I could go to Hawaii wearing something like this.</font>

244
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried about Ddol Ee.</font>

245
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:31,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm babysitting him, not a stranger. Don't you trust me?</font>

246
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Try to enjoy your time there.</font>

247
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:36,678
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel bad for you.</font>

248
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,418
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll take you and Dad next time.</font>

249
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,678
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to move my things to our new house.</font>

250
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,678
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make Gab Dol do it...</font>

251
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:46,618
<font color=#FFFF00>while you are on your honeymoon.</font>

252
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:57,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Where were you? You didn't pick up your phone.</font>

253
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I was in the middle of a meeting.</font>

254
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:01,878
<font color=#FFFF00>We were packing for the honeymoon.</font>

255
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:03,948
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have you finished packing? - Sorry?</font>

256
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:06,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I have.</font>

257
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:08,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you fix me some lunch?</font>

258
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:10,388
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't eaten yet?</font>

259
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:12,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I was busy with my meeting.</font>

260
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:17,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we delay...</font>

261
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:19,218
<font color=#FFFF00>our honeymoon a little bit?</font>

262
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,118
<font color=#FFFF00>We already paid for our flight ticket and hotel.</font>

263
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:23,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something wrong?</font>

264
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:26,178
<font color=#FFFF00>There's something urgent at work.</font>

265
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,618
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

266
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,778
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't know.</font>

267
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I think they need me.</font>

268
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,918
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you want to go by yourself? - What?</font>

269
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:38,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go next month...</font>

270
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:40,818
<font color=#FFFF00>when work situation gets better. Okay?</font>

271
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:46,948
<font color=#FFFF00>We're moving our honeymoon to next month.</font>

272
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:48,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

273
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,818
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be busy at work.</font>

274
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,118
<font color=#FFFF00>I packed for no reason.</font>

275
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:55,388
<font color=#FFFF00>You can leave it and take it after.</font>

276
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,218
<font color=#FFFF00>They delayed their honeymoon.</font>

277
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think something's going on?</font>

278
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:10,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Ask Se Bang when he's done eating.</font>

279
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:15,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you delayed your honeymoon.</font>

280
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:17,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something going on?</font>

281
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,348
<font color=#FFFF00>There's an urgent matter at work.</font>

282
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,118
<font color=#FFFF00>They need me.</font>

283
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:24,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Why were you at the police station earlier?</font>

284
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

285
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw you leaving. Be honest.</font>

286
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:30,178
<font color=#FFFF00>You went last time, too.</font>

287
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:32,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure you're friends with the chief of police?</font>

288
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,148
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing serious.</font>

289
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:40,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Somebody got involved so I had to verify a few things.</font>

290
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:42,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Who got involved?</font>

291
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:45,948
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not me. It was somebody else. Don't worry.</font>

292
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:48,448
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing serious. It has nothing to do with me.</font>

293
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:52,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't go to the police station for something that doesn't involve you.</font>

294
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,718
<font color=#FFFF00>You were at the police station?</font>

295
00:18:58,478 --> 00:19:01,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I was there because somebody I knew got into trouble.</font>

296
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:03,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to verify something for them.</font>

297
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, let's go for groceries.</font>

298
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:07,748
<font color=#FFFF00>The fridge is empty.</font>

299
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:16,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get things to bring to the States. You can choose.</font>

300
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:17,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I buy snacks?</font>

301
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:20,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. Don't buy too many. Pick a few.</font>

302
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:22,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I get some as well?</font>

303
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:33,778
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Ms Shin.</font>

304
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go that way.</font>

305
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:47,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Shin.</font>

306
00:19:56,948 --> 00:19:58,178
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

307
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:00,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to say bye to you.</font>

308
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:03,278
<font color=#FFFF00>We're leaving for the States.</font>

309
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard.</font>

310
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:08,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw you earlier at the grocery store.</font>

311
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,548
<font color=#FFFF00>We were getting things to bring with us to the States.</font>

312
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:15,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you not seeing my dad any more?</font>

313
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,648
<font color=#FFFF00>When are you leaving?</font>

314
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:23,348
<font color=#FFFF00>This weekend.</font>

315
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:29,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to your dad...</font>

316
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:31,518
<font color=#FFFF00>and take good care of your sister.</font>

317
00:20:32,718 --> 00:20:34,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care.</font>

318
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:36,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you make a lot of friends.</font>

319
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:38,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Shin.</font>

320
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you be our mum?</font>

321
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Once we get back and if you end up dating my dad again,</font>

322
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,648
<font color=#FFFF00>please be our mum.</font>

323
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:08,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care.</font>

324
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:23,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all this?</font>

325
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:25,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Weren't you disappointed last time?</font>

326
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:27,388
<font color=#FFFF00>You made dumplings...</font>

327
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:29,478
<font color=#FFFF00>and I only gave you the ruined ones.</font>

328
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:31,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Pick whatever you'd like.</font>

329
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:34,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I made steamed dumplings, fried ones and dumpling soup.</font>

330
00:21:35,218 --> 00:21:36,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want boiled dumplings as well?</font>

331
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,888
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mother. - Go ahead.</font>

332
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:42,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for the food.</font>

333
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:46,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Which one should I eat?</font>

334
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:48,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's pick one</font>

335
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:51,518
<font color=#FFFF00>This one. The fried dumplings.</font>

336
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:54,078
<font color=#FFFF00>- You chose fried dumplings? - I did.</font>

337
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:58,518
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is it good? - Yes.</font>

338
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:04,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang was getting remarried to Jae Soon...</font>

339
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:07,118
<font color=#FFFF00>so I made him dumplings. I wanted them to...</font>

340
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:10,218
<font color=#FFFF00>get along and be happy together.</font>

341
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,448
<font color=#FFFF00>You're supposed to do that even if you don't like them.</font>

342
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:14,248
<font color=#FFFF00>And you fed me torn ones since you like me?</font>

343
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:17,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. We get along just fine.</font>

344
00:22:17,718 --> 00:22:19,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I've known you for decades.</font>

345
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:23,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not close with Se Bang.</font>

346
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,818
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm much closer to you.</font>

347
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:29,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I treat Se Bang like a visitor and I treat you like family.</font>

348
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about it.</font>

349
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:33,318
<font color=#FFFF00>If you argued with him, whose side would I take?</font>

350
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I argue with him?</font>

351
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:36,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead. Can you be better than him?</font>

352
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:38,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I can if you're on my side.</font>

353
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:39,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep eating.</font>

354
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:42,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I added more meat than I did last time.</font>

355
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:51,018
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so good.</font>

356
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:53,478
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I was waiting for.</font>

357
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:55,678
<font color=#FFFF00>There you go.</font>

358
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:08,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

359
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:15,418
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mum. - Stop calling me.</font>

360
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:18,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? I was in a good mood.</font>

361
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:20,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Your in-laws don't even feed you dumplings.</font>

362
00:23:20,678 --> 00:23:22,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so happy?</font>

363
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:23,948
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know about that?</font>

364
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:25,418
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

365
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:27,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard.</font>

366
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:30,448
<font color=#FFFF00>From whom?</font>

367
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:33,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure. Who was it?</font>

368
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:35,778
<font color=#FFFF00>I see. It must be Gab Soon.</font>

369
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:39,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how awesome I am?</font>

370
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:42,618
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother-in-law fed me fried dumplings, steamed dumplings...</font>

371
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:45,348
<font color=#FFFF00>and dumpling soup. The table was full.</font>

372
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:47,618
<font color=#FFFF00>She said Se Bang is a visitor but I'm family.</font>

373
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the best son-in-law.</font>

374
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:50,778
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be proud of yourself.</font>

375
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:53,548
<font color=#FFFF00>There are only two sons-in-law. You're either first or last.</font>

376
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:57,378
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing special. You were convinced over dumplings.</font>

377
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,018
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not just dumplings.</font>

378
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:02,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother made it especially for me. It was just for me.</font>

379
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:04,748
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of a son-in-law gets treated like me?</font>

380
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:06,018
<font color=#FFFF00>What a fool.</font>

381
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:09,778
<font color=#FFFF00>She's feeding you so that she can boss you around.</font>

382
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:11,148
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not like that.</font>

383
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,548
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not your mother. She's your mother-in-law.</font>

384
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:17,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't call her Mother in front of me. She's not your mother.</font>

385
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:18,518
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

386
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:20,818
<font color=#FFFF00>You're my mum and she's my mother.</font>

387
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:23,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Be wise about it.</font>

388
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:27,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you let your in-laws treat you so poorly?</font>

389
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:30,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't act so frivolously or joke all the time.</font>

390
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:32,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Be more reserved.</font>

391
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:35,918
<font color=#FFFF00>They boss you around and make you clean and make dumplings.</font>

392
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,778
<font color=#FFFF00>You're just an errand boy to them.</font>

393
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:41,548
<font color=#FFFF00>They'll treat you properly only if you act maturely.</font>

394
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,278
<font color=#FFFF00>I never made you clean...</font>

395
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:46,118
<font color=#FFFF00>or wash the dishes. I raised you so well...</font>

396
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,878
<font color=#FFFF00>and you get treated like a servant at your in-laws?</font>

397
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Who called me a servant?</font>

398
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:51,578
<font color=#FFFF00>You have no idea.</font>

399
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:53,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not talking to you.</font>

400
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:58,278
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh. I'm sick of this.</font>

401
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:04,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you asleep, Dad?</font>

402
00:25:05,778 --> 00:25:08,548
<font color=#FFFF00>No. Aren't you asleep yet?</font>

403
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't fall asleep.</font>

404
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I met Ms Shin earlier.</font>

405
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,748
<font color=#FFFF00>- What for? - Just in case.</font>

406
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:27,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked her if she could date you again...</font>

407
00:25:27,848 --> 00:25:29,118
<font color=#FFFF00>once we come back from the States.</font>

408
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,778
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess not.</font>

409
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:19,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms Shin, please be our mum.</font>

410
00:27:47,678 --> 00:27:49,378
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if something's happened.</font>

411
00:27:50,578 --> 00:27:52,348
<font color=#FFFF00>She says it's nothing special.</font>

412
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:58,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Should we tell Jae Soon...</font>

413
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,948
<font color=#FFFF00>about Se Bang's criminal record...</font>

414
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:03,018
<font color=#FFFF00>and ask her what she thinks?</font>

415
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:05,878
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not going to change anything.</font>

416
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I just hope that the same thing will not happen again.</font>

417
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:10,748
<font color=#FFFF00>It better not.</font>

418
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:12,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Most importantly,</font>

419
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:17,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I want Jae Soon to stop suffering.</font>

420
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:22,878
<font color=#FFFF00>She's been the good daughter who did everything we told her to.</font>

421
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,948
<font color=#FFFF00>She readily obeyed us.</font>

422
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:28,848
<font color=#FFFF00>She didn't even touch food before we told her to eat.</font>

423
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:33,148
<font color=#FFFF00>How could she be ill-fated and get married three times?</font>

424
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:37,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's my fault.</font>

425
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:40,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've kept her longer when she came home after her divorce.</font>

426
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have married her off so quickly.</font>

427
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:45,448
<font color=#FFFF00>It's already in the past.</font>

428
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:48,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Live long.</font>

429
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:51,348
<font color=#FFFF00>You must live long to protect your kids.</font>

430
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:53,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do it alone.</font>

431
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,718
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still up?</font>

432
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:01,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Weren't you sleeping?</font>

433
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:03,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so surprised?</font>

434
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:06,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you must be sleeping.</font>

435
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:09,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you hiding something from me?</font>

436
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:11,418
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

437
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you hiding something from her?</font>

438
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:14,578
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

439
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:16,578
<font color=#FFFF00>We were getting some drinks because your mum couldn't sleep.</font>

440
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:20,278
<font color=#FFFF00>I like how Se Bang has changed a lot from before,</font>

441
00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:23,918
<font color=#FFFF00>but since he's a business man, I was worried...</font>

442
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:25,448
<font color=#FFFF00>if he'd be out all the time.</font>

443
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:28,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Since your wedding's coming up,</font>

444
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:30,278
<font color=#FFFF00>various thoughts come across my mind.</font>

445
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:32,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't just sit back if that happens.</font>

446
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:36,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not like how I was before. I don't tolerate such things.</font>

447
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:38,478
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. Don't tolerate.</font>

448
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:41,718
<font color=#FFFF00>This time, you should whip him...</font>

449
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,778
<font color=#FFFF00>instead of being silent like before.</font>

450
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:46,718
<font color=#FFFF00>It all depends on you.</font>

451
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:05,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Have fun.</font>

452
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,478
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't like the girl, reject her whenever you want.</font>

453
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:08,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be going now.</font>

454
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,578
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not hiring.</font>

455
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:46,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Consider that things are already over between you and him.</font>

456
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do that.</font>

457
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:50,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Relationships don't work...</font>

458
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:53,148
<font color=#FFFF00>simply because one likes another.</font>

459
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,848
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do then?</font>

460
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:58,578
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need to cry.</font>

461
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:02,118
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I told you to study abroad.</font>

462
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:05,478
<font color=#FFFF00>You can get over him soon if you study abroad.</font>

463
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:07,218
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't treat you well anyway.</font>

464
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:09,518
<font color=#FFFF00>He often lied because he couldn't get over her.</font>

465
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:10,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't see why you still like him.</font>

466
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:12,878
<font color=#FFFF00>Simply put, she's deeply lost in love with him.</font>

467
00:31:12,878 --> 00:31:15,218
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't help it if you're lost in love.</font>

468
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:16,278
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

469
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:18,178
<font color=#FFFF00>She's in love with the wrong person.</font>

470
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop crying and bring medicine for your grandpa.</font>

471
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:23,478
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not even interested in me, are you?</font>

472
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:26,448
<font color=#FFFF00>All you do is care about Mr Geum and that guy.</font>

473
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:27,778
<font color=#FFFF00>You brat.</font>

474
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:29,918
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you call your brother so?</font>

475
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so harsh on her.</font>

476
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm being harsh on purpose.</font>

477
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:36,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been too easy on her so far.</font>

478
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:38,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at Soo Jo. He was brought up in a poor family,</font>

479
00:31:38,948 --> 00:31:40,518
<font color=#FFFF00>but he grew up so well.</font>

481
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:57,118
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the coffee from your favourite coffee shop.</font>

482
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:58,578
<font color=#FFFF00>It smelled so nice.</font>

483
00:31:58,578 --> 00:31:59,948
<font color=#FFFF00>You even got doughnuts.</font>

484
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:02,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come here because of this?</font>

485
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:04,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Compared to your side dishes, this is nothing.</font>

486
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:07,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon wants you to come to her wedding, too.</font>

487
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:08,948
<font color=#FFFF00>To her wedding?</font>

488
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:10,878
<font color=#FFFF00>You can come freely. In exchange,</font>

489
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:13,118
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll have to be prepared.</font>

490
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:16,018
<font color=#FFFF00>All my relatives will be there, so you should greet them...</font>

491
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,278
<font color=#FFFF00>that you'll be the daughter-in-law.</font>

492
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously, I told you not to make weird jokes.</font>

493
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:21,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not kidding.</font>

494
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:23,278
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you can't marry me off to another woman.</font>

495
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:25,448
<font color=#FFFF00>You should come to the wedding and make yourself...</font>

496
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:27,678
<font color=#FFFF00>officially known to all my family and relatives.</font>

497
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:28,848
<font color=#FFFF00>You.</font>

498
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:31,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Man Joo.</font>

499
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I've got a conscience.</font>

500
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I got married as I pleased.</font>

501
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:39,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Asking you now...</font>

502
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:41,848
<font color=#FFFF00>wouldn't be right.</font>

503
00:32:48,848 --> 00:32:51,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't deserve to love you.</font>

504
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:22,178
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's you, right? - Excuse me?</font>

505
00:33:22,178 --> 00:33:23,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Incredible!</font>

506
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:31,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Both the sound and the colour are amazing.</font>

507
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:36,478
<font color=#FFFF00>It smells even better. It's sad that I can't deliver that.</font>

508
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,848
<font color=#FFFF00>You live until 100 now. Life can't be over at the first chapter.

<font color=#FFFF00>You should prepare for the second and the third chapters.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>"Oh my."</font>

513
00:33:56,178 --> 00:33:58,348
<font color=#FFFF00>This is you, right? How incredible!</font>

514
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:01,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you live in this building? I live here, too.</font>

515
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:03,148
<font color=#FFFF00>It's an honour to meet you, Mr Shin Joong Nyeon.</font>

516
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:04,878
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's take a selfie.</font>

517
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:08,018
<font color=#FFFF00>- A selfie? - In 1, 2, 3.</font>

518
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:15,118
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing wrong with my age</font>

519
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:16,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen?</font>

520
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so... Did you pick money or something?</font>

521
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:21,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Incredible.</font>

522
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:22,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something good happen?</font>

523
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,148
<font color=#FFFF00>A woman he saw for the first time smiled at him.</font>

524
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:28,718
<font color=#FFFF00>This is really incredible.</font>

525
00:34:29,178 --> 00:34:31,878
<font color=#FFFF00>It was only recent when I posted it, but he recognised me so soon.</font>

526
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:34,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I even took a selfie with him.</font>

527
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Becoming a star isn't that hard.</font>

528
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:37,678
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be careful with that.</font>

529
00:34:37,678 --> 00:34:40,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Once your profile is out, you can't go back.</font>

530
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not doing something wrong.</font>

531
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,318
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

532
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:45,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You always ruin my feelings.</font>

533
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just worried that something might happen.</font>

534
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:49,878
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful just in case something happens later on.</font>

535
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Many people end up struggling.</font>

536
00:34:51,478 --> 00:34:52,918
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it about?</font>

537
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,218
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to know.</font>

538
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:57,718
<font color=#FFFF00>He came home all excited. What is it?</font>

539
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:07,718
<font color=#FFFF00>You were rejected? Why would you be rejected?</font>

540
00:35:07,718 --> 00:35:10,718
<font color=#FFFF00>That's impossible and unbelievable.</font>

541
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:13,218
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what happened. I'll go upstairs.</font>

542
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:16,378
<font color=#FFFF00>That doesn't make any sense. Let me ask.</font>

543
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:19,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I told her to highlight it. Why didn't she do it?</font>

544
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:23,078
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been rejected. Asking why would be even more embarrassing.</font>

545
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:25,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Soo Jo is right about that.</font>

546
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:27,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, let's find out the reason.</font>

547
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm too tall so her neck hurts to see me.</font>

548
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:31,678
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

549
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I stretched his neck when he was young.</font>

550
00:35:35,878 --> 00:35:38,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I've already set up the next candidate for you.</font>

551
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:40,118
<font color=#FFFF00>She kicked away her good fortune...</font>

552
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:42,148
<font color=#FFFF00>by not appreciating Soo Jo.</font>

553
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure that you were rejected?</font>

554
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:51,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I am.</font>

555
00:35:51,718 --> 00:35:53,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does a rejected guy look so calm?</font>

556
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:55,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I break down in tears then?</font>

557
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:58,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I better not be rejected next time.</font>

558
00:35:58,648 --> 00:35:59,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to reduce my height.</font>

559
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:01,548
<font color=#FFFF00>It's strange.</font>

561
00:36:08,288 --> 00:36:09,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

562
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:18,478
<font color=#FFFF00>It's last week's sales and design reports.</font>

563
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:19,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks.</font>

564
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:28,748
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very detailed.</font>

565
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:31,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to discuss with you.</font>

566
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:33,348
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? Tell me.</font>

567
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm scared to bump into my son again.</font>

568
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:41,678
<font color=#FFFF00>He won't come here to a different district.</font>

569
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:43,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Dating secretly makes me so nervous.</font>

570
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,078
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's fun and thrilling.</font>

571
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:51,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we get some ice cream, too?</font>

572
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:55,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do everything we want and not hold back.</font>

573
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:56,848
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll go buy some. - I'll come with you.</font>

574
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,848
<font color=#FFFF00>No, just wait here.</font>

575
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:00,818
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get them really quickly.</font>

577
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:15,748
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad! - What?</font>

578
00:37:22,878 --> 00:37:25,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here? You said you had a meeting.</font>

579
00:37:26,148 --> 00:37:27,878
<font color=#FFFF00>The meeting just ended.</font>

580
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:30,118
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get in. - No, I'll walk home.</font>

581
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:32,248
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too far. You might catch a cold.</font>

582
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,378
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get in. - I'll take the bus.</font>

583
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:36,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

584
00:37:57,718 --> 00:37:59,618
<font color=#FFFF00>You had the meeting in a hotel.</font>

585
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:00,818
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Yes.</font>

589
00:38:10,148 --> 00:38:11,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to answer that?</font>

00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:13,878
<font color=#FFFF00>No. It's just a spam.</font>

591
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:15,348
<font color=#FFFF00>(Reject)</font>

592
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,748
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go faster. - Why?</font>

593
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to go to the bathroom.</font>

594
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:47,948
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going to fall.</font>

595
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:18,848
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened? Why didn't you answer the phone?</font>

596
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:20,678
<font color=#FFFF00>The battery died.</font>

597
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:22,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Relief Patch, where are you?</font>

598
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:26,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I had two ice creams and was shivering in the cold.</font>

599
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:28,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I just came home.</font>

600
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:29,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm so cold.</font>

601
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:31,848
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

602
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:35,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I came home because I had to use the bathroom.</font>

603
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:36,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Bathroom?</font>

604
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:38,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

605
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:41,678
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a stomachache all of a sudden. I'm sorry.</font>

606
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:43,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever.</font>

607
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:47,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't get upset. I'll go crazy if you do.</font>

608
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:49,448
<font color=#FFFF00>We have no time to get upset.</font>

609
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:52,788
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've told me at least.</font>

610
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:54,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to scold you.</font>

611
00:39:55,288 --> 00:39:57,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Please do. I want to get scolded.</font>

612
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:01,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so mean.</font>

613
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,648
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who is it? - It's me.</font>

614
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:21,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Soo Jo?</font>

615
00:40:32,818 --> 00:40:34,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I got formula and diapers for the twins.</font>

616
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:37,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Why did you buy so much?</font>

617
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,218
<font color=#FFFF00>You should save money.</font>

618
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:45,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Peekaboo.</font>

619
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:47,788
<font color=#FFFF00>They're sleeping.</font>

620
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:54,788
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are they okay now? - Yes. They don't throw up any more.</font>

621
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:58,218
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are their names? - Il Ho and Ee Ho.</font>

622
00:40:58,348 --> 00:41:00,118
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Il Ho and that is Ee Ho.</font>

623
00:41:03,518 --> 00:41:05,248
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're making noodles, make mine, too.</font>

624
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:06,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

625
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:12,118
<font color=#FFFF00>I only have one.</font>

626
00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:13,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go buy some.</font>

627
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Here, take the money.</font>

628
00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:39,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I can cook noodles better than you.</font>

629
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:43,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Then cook it next time and show me how good you are.</font>

630
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:44,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

631
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:49,448
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what? You're a spendthrift.</font>

632
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,818
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll go bankrupt if you spend more than what you have.</font>

633
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you buy a whole box?</font>

634
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't waste your money.</font>

635
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:57,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm grateful...</font>

636
00:41:57,578 --> 00:42:00,078
<font color=#FFFF00>for the formula and diapers, but I feel uncomfortable.</font>

637
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you're broke.</font>

638
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:03,718
<font color=#FFFF00>You've never bought a box of noodles before?</font>

639
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:07,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Never. You're rich if you can do that.</font>

640
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:09,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I've said the same thing before.</font>

641
00:42:09,948 --> 00:42:12,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Be frugal. You can't save money if you spend it like that.</font>

642
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:14,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll have to get married.</font>

643
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:17,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Women don't like men with no money.</font>

644
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:21,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you're handsome, women will flock if you have money.</font>

645
00:42:25,518 --> 00:42:26,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

646
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I'm Ban Ji Ha.</font>

647
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:33,288
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Really?</font>

648
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you. Thank you so much.</font>

649
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:44,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you win the lottery?</font>

650
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:47,478
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll start working at a design office next week.</font>

651
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,418
<font color=#FFFF00>The secretary just called me.</font>

652
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:51,818
<font color=#FFFF00>They want me to start working next week. Goodness.</font>

653
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:55,118
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I can pay you back.</font>

654
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:56,918
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a contract job, but this is great.</font>

655
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:00,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you happy?</font>

656
00:43:00,148 --> 00:43:03,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. I can finally achieve my dream.</font>

657
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,518
<font color=#FFFF00>You probably don't understand how I feel.</font>

658
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:09,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess the manager put in a good word. He always nagged at me.</font>

659
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:12,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Was it the director?</font>

660
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:15,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Whoever it was, congratulations.</font>

661
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:18,518
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll be seeing each other often, right?</font>

662
00:43:18,918 --> 00:43:20,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I quit working at the warehouse.</font>

663
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:23,018
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. You're a chauffeur now, right?</font>

664
00:43:23,348 --> 00:43:24,348
<font color=#FFFF00>A chauffeur?</font>

665
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:26,448
<font color=#FFFF00>That car was your boss' car, wasn't it?</font>

666
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:29,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes... That's right.</font>

667
00:43:29,948 --> 00:43:32,848
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, you look different.</font>

668
00:43:32,948 --> 00:43:34,248
<font color=#FFFF00>You look nicer.</font>

669
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:36,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you steal your boss' clothes?</font>

670
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,288
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

671
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:40,848
<font color=#FFFF00>They told me to wear nice clothes for the boss.</font>

672
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:42,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't drive his car secretly.</font>

673
00:43:43,018 --> 00:43:44,318
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll get fired if you get caught.</font>

674
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:47,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't get superficial. Save up as much as you can.</font>

675
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so happy.</font>

676
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,548
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

677
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:57,448
<font color=#FFFF00>The noodles got too soft.</font>

678
00:43:58,918 --> 00:44:02,178
<font color=#FFFF00>You're wasting food. It'll still taste delicious.</font>

679
00:44:02,278 --> 00:44:04,178
<font color=#FFFF00>I make it go soft when I'm hungry.</font>

680
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:05,648
<font color=#FFFF00>That way, there's more to eat.</font>

681
00:44:22,178 --> 00:44:24,948
<font color=#FFFF00>(Seoul Police Station)</font>

682
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:45,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Jeon!</font>

683
00:45:18,378 --> 00:45:21,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, we're husband and wife. You know that, right?</font>

684
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:23,118
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no turning back.</font>

685
00:45:27,418 --> 00:45:29,378
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you made Gab Dol dumplings.</font>

686
00:45:29,578 --> 00:45:31,678
<font color=#FFFF00>He bragged about how you made so many different ones.</font>

687
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:34,478
<font color=#FFFF00>He would've cried if I didn't.</font>

688
00:45:34,518 --> 00:45:37,818
<font color=#FFFF00>He ate so much because he couldn't last time.</font>

689
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:39,478
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the best.</font>

690
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:43,218
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're here. - Hi. Congratulations.</font>

691
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:45,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I came here to have dinner and talk with you.</font>

692
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:48,048
<font color=#FFFF00>- Good. - Won't you get a facial?</font>

693
00:45:48,418 --> 00:45:51,318
<font color=#FFFF00>She went to the sauna and took a bath.</font>

694
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:53,178
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not sparkly Gab Soon...</font>

695
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,248
<font color=#FFFF00>but it's sparkly Jae Soon.</font>

696
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,648
<font color=#FFFF00>You really do glow.</font>

697
00:45:59,178 --> 00:46:02,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me see. It's so beautiful.</font>

698
00:46:02,848 --> 00:46:04,948
<font color=#FFFF00>This reminds me of that movie.</font>

699
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:06,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it called "Lust, Caution"?</font>

700
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:09,878
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a scene where the female actress gets a ring.</font>

701
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:11,948
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a huge, pink diamond.</font>

702
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:14,218
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. I watched it in the theatre...</font>

703
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:17,648
<font color=#FFFF00>and when that scene came on, all the girls were in awe.</font>

704
00:46:17,648 --> 00:46:19,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I would be like that, too.</font>

705
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:21,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been through it all.</font>

706
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:25,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm living proof.</font>

707
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:26,448
<font color=#FFFF00>- Whatever. - It's true.</font>

708
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:28,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Nobody ever gave you a ring.</font>

709
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:31,978
<font color=#FFFF00>None of that was worth it.</font>

710
00:46:31,978 --> 00:46:35,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Every woman deserves one of these.</font>

711
00:46:35,348 --> 00:46:37,318
<font color=#FFFF00>It's too late for you or me.</font>

712
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:38,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get myself one.</font>

713
00:46:38,878 --> 00:46:40,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't expect one from a man.</font>

714
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,848
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not the same.</font>

715
00:46:42,848 --> 00:46:46,548
<font color=#FFFF00>You're supposed to get this from a man.</font>

716
00:46:47,548 --> 00:46:48,618
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true.</font>

717
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:51,278
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need it. I get Gab Dol's pension.</font>

718
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:55,348
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a clever girl.</font>

719
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:58,748
<font color=#FFFF00>When are you going to raise Dal Pa's wage?</font>

720
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:01,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you bringing that up?</font>

721
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,678
<font color=#FFFF00>I will when it's time.</font>

722
00:47:05,548 --> 00:47:06,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Dal Pa.</font>

723
00:47:08,548 --> 00:47:09,648
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

724
00:47:12,978 --> 00:47:14,318
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

725
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:16,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to clean the building...</font>

726
00:47:16,048 --> 00:47:19,348
<font color=#FFFF00>we made contract with and somebody else was cleaning already.</font>

727
00:47:19,618 --> 00:47:20,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Does this make any sense?</font>

728
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:24,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to speak to their manager but they refused.</font>

729
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:34,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Ms Shin.</font>

730
00:47:34,578 --> 00:47:36,978
<font color=#FFFF00>We were going to sign with you,</font>

731
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,218
<font color=#FFFF00>but our boss had already signed with some other company.</font>

732
00:47:39,218 --> 00:47:42,718
<font color=#FFFF00>We gave you three free services. You can't do this.</font>

733
00:47:42,718 --> 00:47:44,948
<font color=#FFFF00>We already made contracts with our cleaners.</font>

734
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:48,778
<font color=#FFFF00>We already paid the deposits. You can't do this.</font>

735
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:51,918
<font color=#FFFF00>You received our service as if you were going to sign with us.</font>

736
00:47:51,918 --> 00:47:53,318
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't fair.</font>

737
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:55,318
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not up to me.</font>

738
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:58,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Once this contract is done, we'll talk again.</font>

739
00:47:58,548 --> 00:48:00,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me talk to your boss.</font>

740
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:02,948
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll explain and talk to him.</font>

741
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:05,948
<font color=#FFFF00>The contract's been done so we can't do anything.</font>

742
00:48:09,718 --> 00:48:10,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

743
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:20,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What now? We lost money.</font>

744
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:21,778
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't feel like doing this any more.</font>

745
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:23,978
<font color=#FFFF00>We should have signed the contract first.</font>

746
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:26,748
<font color=#FFFF00>We should have known when they waited on it.</font>

747
00:48:27,618 --> 00:48:29,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want a drink? It's on me.</font>

748
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:31,618
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't even have money.</font>

749
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:32,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go clean.</font>

750
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:35,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's take today off. I'm not in the mood to clean.</font>

751
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:38,118
<font color=#FFFF00>It won't make a difference to take a day off.</font>

752
00:48:38,678 --> 00:48:40,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home and get some rest.</font>

753
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:41,878
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll sign first next time.</font>

754
00:49:17,648 --> 00:49:19,078
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm home.</font>

755
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:06,448
<font color=#FFFF00>That was close.</font>

756
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:10,248
<font color=#FFFF00>You're back.</font>

757
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:11,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Move over.</font>

758
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:15,078
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me finish. - We have to clean and sleep.</font>

759
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:23,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to eat in bed?</font>

760
00:50:23,078 --> 00:50:24,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop nagging.</font>

761
00:50:58,778 --> 00:51:00,218
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

762
00:51:00,218 --> 00:51:02,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Do some house chores when you get back from work.</font>

763
00:51:02,048 --> 00:51:04,448
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't do the dishes or collect laundry.</font>

764
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:06,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to play games?</font>

765
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:08,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I just started.</font>

766
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:11,378
<font color=#FFFF00>I was trying to release some stress by playing games.</font>

767
00:51:11,848 --> 00:51:14,518
<font color=#FFFF00>- I had a rough day. - So did I.</font>

768
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:16,948
<font color=#FFFF00>It's tough dealing with people.</font>

769
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You always make it sound like you're the only one making money.</font>

770
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:22,178
<font color=#FFFF00>If I was unemployed, it would have been much worse.</font>

771
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:23,678
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what I meant.</font>

772
00:51:23,678 --> 00:51:26,048
<font color=#FFFF00>If you come home first, you can do some house chores.</font>

773
00:51:26,048 --> 00:51:27,618
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to react this way.</font>

774
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,978
<font color=#FFFF00>You keep nagging.</font>

775
00:51:29,978 --> 00:51:31,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't even play games.</font>

776
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:42,978
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop playing dumb.</font>

777
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:46,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell us properly. We'll be done faster that way.</font>

778
00:52:46,348 --> 00:52:48,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know about it.</font>

779
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:51,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me a second.</font>

780
00:52:54,578 --> 00:52:55,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

781
00:52:56,148 --> 00:52:59,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Why weren't you picking up? Where are you?</font>

782
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:02,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you call me? I'm in the office.</font>

783
00:53:02,448 --> 00:53:03,748
<font color=#FFFF00>The office?</font>

784
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:05,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to take care of a few things.</font>

785
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:06,978
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

786
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:09,978
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you worried that I'm up to no good?</font>

787
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,648
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine.</font>

788
00:53:12,418 --> 00:53:13,478
<font color=#FFFF00>See you tomorrow.</font>

789
00:53:13,478 --> 00:53:15,678
<font color=#FFFF00>We're a married couple from tomorrow.</font>

790
00:53:15,918 --> 00:53:16,978
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodnight.</font>

791
00:53:16,978 --> 00:53:19,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up, Mr Jeon.</font>

792
00:53:19,748 --> 00:53:20,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's that?</font>

793
00:53:23,018 --> 00:53:26,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry, it's the television.</font>

794
00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:27,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to bed.</font>

795
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Talk to you later.</font>

796
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:13,448
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of fate is this?</font>

797
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:18,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You're marrying the same man twice.</font>

798
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:21,918
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you feel?</font>

799
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:24,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm...</font>

800
00:54:25,378 --> 00:54:27,778
<font color=#FFFF00>going to accept it as my fate.</font>

801
00:54:28,718 --> 00:54:31,718
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't have to suffer because of money any more.</font>

802
00:54:32,918 --> 00:54:36,318
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the end of your suffering. It's a happy beginning.</font>

803
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:38,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go to bed.</font>

804
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:45,318
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to put make up on so that people don't think you're old.</font>

805
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry, Mum. I'll be happy.</font>

806
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:51,378
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to be.</font>

807
00:54:52,148 --> 00:54:54,018
<font color=#FFFF00>You're my first child...</font>

808
00:54:54,018 --> 00:54:56,518
<font color=#FFFF00>so I worry about everything you do.</font>

809
00:54:57,748 --> 00:55:00,378
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried that people won't treat you right.</font>

810
00:55:00,948 --> 00:55:02,518
<font color=#FFFF00>They do.</font>

811
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:04,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so bold now.</font>

812
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:06,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Things will work out.</font>

813
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:08,948
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the oldest child of this family.</font>

814
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:15,918
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing, Mal Nyeon?</font>

815
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:17,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, gosh.</font>

816
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,978
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't rush me.</font>

817
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:22,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you the bride? Don't dress up so much.</font>

818
00:55:22,748 --> 00:55:24,718
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Let's go.</font>

819
00:55:28,278 --> 00:55:29,348
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

820
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:37,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so pretty.</font>

821
00:56:01,678 --> 00:56:02,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Jeon.</font>

822
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:06,218
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the problem? I already gave you my statement.</font>

823
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:07,818
<font color=#FFFF00>You said I'm only a testifier.</font>

824
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:09,448
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeon Se Bang,</font>

825
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:12,218
<font color=#FFFF00>you've officially become the suspect. You're under arrest.</font>

826
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:14,918
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey! - Stop him!</font>

827
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off of me! Get off!</font>

828
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,248
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't move! - No!</font>

829
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:23,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me go. Let me go!</font>

830
00:56:25,118 --> 00:56:26,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeon Se Bang.</font>

831
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:28,748
<font color=#FFFF00>We're arresting you under the charge of fraud.</font>

832
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,248
<font color=#FFFF00>You may have an attorney,</font>

833
00:56:30,248 --> 00:56:31,818
<font color=#FFFF00>and you have the right to remain silent.</font>

834
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:08,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I must say goodbye to you now.</font>

835
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:11,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'm sad that you're leaving, but I'll see you after three years.</font>

836
00:57:12,018 --> 00:57:14,548
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not too late for you to change your mind and stay.</font>

837
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:18,118
<font color=#FFFF00>We can always have video conferences.</font>

838
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:20,648
<font color=#FFFF00>If there is something I have to do, please contact me.</font>

839
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:23,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take care. Goodbye.</font>

840
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:24,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye.</font>

841
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:37,818
<font color=#FFFF00>To the airport, please.</font>

842
00:57:44,348 --> 00:57:45,818
<font color=#FFFF00>A Young. Are you on your way?</font>

843
00:57:47,078 --> 00:57:48,948
<font color=#FFFF00>No? Why?</font>

844
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:52,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Da Rong can't find her toy.</font>

845
00:57:52,148 --> 00:57:54,018
<font color=#FFFF00>We're still looking for it.</font>

846
00:57:54,478 --> 00:57:55,618
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll be there soon.</font>

847
00:57:55,678 --> 00:57:57,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell her I'll buy her a new one.</font>

848
00:57:57,448 --> 00:58:00,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You should leave right away. I'm on my way to the airport now.</font>

849
00:58:10,978 --> 00:58:12,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we...</font>

850
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:14,278
<font color=#FFFF00>make a quick stop?</font>

851
01:00:13,478 --> 01:00:15,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Who among his family is presiding over the wedding?</font>

852
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,948
<font color=#FFFF00>His parents passed away, so no one is.</font>

853
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:24,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Young Ran come?</font>

854
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:26,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would she come?</font>

855
01:00:26,178 --> 01:00:27,278
<font color=#FFFF00>To see me.</font>

856
01:00:27,678 --> 01:00:29,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought we could eat together.</font>

857
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:31,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Whom should I eat with then?</font>

858
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:33,178
<font color=#FFFF00>You can eat with me.</font>

859
01:00:34,378 --> 01:00:36,048
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better be a good host today.</font>

860
01:00:36,148 --> 01:00:39,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. Emceeing weddings is my speciality.</font>

861
01:00:40,218 --> 01:00:41,618
<font color=#FFFF00>But strangely,</font>

862
01:00:42,248 --> 01:00:44,918
<font color=#FFFF00>couples who had me as the host always got divorced.</font>

863
01:00:46,718 --> 01:00:49,148
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should be careful, too. - You punk.</font>

864
01:00:51,678 --> 01:00:52,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon.</font>

865
01:00:53,648 --> 01:00:54,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad wanted me to give you this.</font>

866
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:06,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon.</font>

867
01:01:07,818 --> 01:01:10,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Flying birds never look back.</font>

868
01:01:11,678 --> 01:01:13,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget about the past...</font>

869
01:01:14,248 --> 01:01:15,848
<font color=#FFFF00>and have a fun life.</font>

870
01:01:17,018 --> 01:01:18,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry that...</font>

871
01:01:19,118 --> 01:01:20,878
<font color=#FFFF00>there isn't much I can do for you.</font>

872
01:01:22,048 --> 01:01:24,818
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you, my first daughter.</font>

873
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't cry.</font>

874
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Your make up will smudge.</font>

875
01:01:38,878 --> 01:01:39,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

876
01:01:41,678 --> 01:01:44,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Why isn't Se Bang here yet? The ceremony will start soon.</font>

877
01:01:44,878 --> 01:01:47,048
<font color=#FFFF00>- I know. - Call him.</font>

878
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,748
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's not picking up. - He's not?</font>

879
01:02:06,648 --> 01:02:08,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to change?</font>

880
01:02:08,618 --> 01:02:09,878
<font color=#FFFF00>No, thank you.</font>

881
01:02:11,618 --> 01:02:13,278
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you like some ox bone soup?</font>

882
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:16,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine.</font>

883
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:19,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You called an attorney, right?</font>

884
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:21,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I make a phone call?</font>

885
01:02:25,018 --> 01:02:26,618
<font color=#FFFF00>(Se Bang)</font>

886
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:29,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang. What's going on?</font>

887
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:32,718
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm not Se Bang. - Hello?</font>

888
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:34,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't this Se Bang's phone?</font>

889
01:02:34,778 --> 01:02:37,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr Jeon can't talk right now.</font>

890
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:38,618
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

891
01:02:39,378 --> 01:02:41,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he get into some kind of an accident?</font>

892
01:02:41,648 --> 01:02:43,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Not exactly. Please hold on.</font>

893
01:02:48,748 --> 01:02:49,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

894
01:02:50,018 --> 01:02:52,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang. What's going on?</font>

895
01:02:52,918 --> 01:02:54,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he say you can't talk?</font>

896
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:57,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you? You should be here by now.</font>

897
01:02:57,548 --> 01:03:00,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I can marry Jae Soon today.</font>

898
01:03:00,678 --> 01:03:03,318
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll set another date soon.</font>

899
01:03:03,418 --> 01:03:04,578
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

900
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me the truth. Where are you?</font>

901
01:03:07,678 --> 01:03:09,948
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where is he? - Where are you?</font>

902
01:03:11,248 --> 01:03:13,778
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm at a police station.</font>

903
01:03:15,048 --> 01:03:16,218
<font color=#FFFF00>A police station?</font>

904
01:03:17,718 --> 01:03:18,778
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

905
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:21,648
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say? - Joong Nyeon.</font>

906
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:26,178
<font color=#FFFF00>Why hasn't the ceremony started yet?</font>

907
01:03:26,478 --> 01:03:28,148
<font color=#FFFF00>It's supposed to start 20 minutes ago.</font>

908
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Go out and see what's going on.</font>

909
01:03:30,748 --> 01:03:31,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be right back.</font>

910
01:03:33,918 --> 01:03:35,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum. Why hasn't the ceremony started?</font>

911
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Gab Soon. Please wait outside.</font>

912
01:03:40,518 --> 01:03:41,648
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

913
01:03:45,418 --> 01:03:46,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to say.</font>

914
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:49,878
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think you can have the wedding today.</font>

915
01:03:50,548 --> 01:03:52,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me what is going on.</font>

916
01:03:54,548 --> 01:03:55,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Bang was...</font>

917
01:03:56,748 --> 01:03:57,918
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to him?</font>

918
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:00,778
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me already.</font>

919
01:04:01,378 --> 01:04:02,918
<font color=#FFFF00>He was taken to the police station.</font>

920
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:06,548
<font color=#FFFF00>The police station?</font>

921
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:10,118
<font color=#FFFF00>He was arrested for fraud.</font>

922
01:04:21,678 --> 01:04:24,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon. Jae Soon!</font>

923
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,648
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jae Soon. - Jae Soon.</font>

924
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:47,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon!</font>

925
01:04:48,078 --> 01:04:49,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon!</font>

926
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:57,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me explain.</font>

927
01:05:34,148 --> 01:05:36,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you even consider me your family?</font>

928
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:40,378
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm your old and useless daughter.</font>

929
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:43,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you happy to leave me with that criminal...</font>

930
01:05:43,718 --> 01:05:45,178
<font color=#FFFF00>as if you were taking out trash?</font>

931
01:05:45,248 --> 01:05:47,948
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jae Soon, it's not that. - Jae Soon.</font>

932
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say a word.</font>

933
01:05:53,718 --> 01:05:55,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you wrote me that letter saying...</font>

934
01:05:58,648 --> 01:06:00,348
<font color=#FFFF00>that you love me and you're sorry?</font>

935
01:06:09,918 --> 01:06:12,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, I see what you meant.</font>

936
01:06:13,448 --> 01:06:15,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep your successful children...</font>

937
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:18,618
<font color=#FFFF00>and abandon useless ones like me.</font>

938
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:24,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather kill myself than ask you to do something for me.</font>

939
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:28,978
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you ever look for me again.</font>

940
01:06:30,178 --> 01:06:31,718
<font color=#FFFF00>From today,</font>

941
01:06:32,918 --> 01:06:34,548
<font color=#FFFF00>consider me dead.</font>

942
01:06:43,218 --> 01:06:44,478
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon...</font>

943
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:45,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Mum.</font>

944
01:06:47,818 --> 01:06:48,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae Soon...</font>

945
01:07:14,418 --> 01:07:15,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't this exciting?</font>

946
01:07:15,748 --> 01:07:17,618
<font color=#FFFF00>- It'll be so fun, right? - Yes.</font>

947
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:18,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't wait.</font>

948
01:07:51,878 --> 01:07:52,918
<font color=#FFFF00>(Our Gab Soon)</font>

949
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:55,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive me, Jae Soon.</font>

950
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:58,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to this. It says Jae Soon's number is not in service.</font>

951
01:07:58,548 --> 01:08:00,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she'll sever all contact.</font>

952
01:08:00,048 --> 01:08:01,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe she went to Geum Sik.</font>

953
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:04,218
<font color=#FFFF00>It's an honour to have you back as our president after six months.</font>

954
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:05,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I will continue to work hard.</font>

955
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say a thing to Mother.</font>

956
01:08:06,648 --> 01:08:08,778
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad she didn't marry the swindler.</font>

957
01:08:08,778 --> 01:08:10,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you find it that amusing?</font>

958
01:08:10,018 --> 01:08:11,618
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you talk about it so carelessly?</font>

959
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:14,078
<font color=#FFFF00>Introduce yourself. He's the director of our company.</font>

960
01:08:14,078 --> 01:08:15,218
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's my son. - Hello.</font>

961
01:08:15,218 --> 01:08:17,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry for being rude. Please understand.</font>

962
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's give these flyers out to people.</font>

963
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:20,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!</font>

964
01:08:20,418 --> 01:08:22,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I will find her no matter what.</font>

965
01:08:22,048 --> 01:08:24,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you, Jae Soon?</font>
