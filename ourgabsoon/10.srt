<font color="yellow">You jerks!</font>

63
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,282
<font color="yellow">Give me back my phone.</font>

64
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:08,882
<font color="yellow">I need to pick up the phone.</font>

65
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,622
<font color="yellow">I need to answer the call.</font>

66
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:19,122
<font color="yellow">I need to answer...</font>

67
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:26,852
<font color="yellow">Open up.</font>

68
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:35,352
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, I'm scared.</font>

69
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,882
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to be scared of. I'm here.</font>

70
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,782
<font color="yellow">Mum will find us soon if we stay here.</font>

71
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:48,022
<font color="yellow">Let her go now.</font>

72
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:49,452
<font color="yellow">We need to use the room.</font>

73
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:07,122
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

74
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:09,022
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

75

<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

81
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,422
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

82
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,152
<font color="yellow">This is child abuse.</font>

83
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:37,382
<font color="yellow">We need to report it to the police.</font>

84
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:39,052
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

85
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,752
<font color="yellow">How can I be calm?</font>

86
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:43,522
<font color="yellow">How could she hit a child?</font>

87
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:44,852
<font color="yellow">She has her own child too.</font>

88
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:46,452
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the police.</font>

89
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:48,752
<font color="yellow">We need to go to the police?</font>

90
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:51,152
<font color="yellow">You said you got hit. We need to report her.</font>

91
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:52,252
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

92
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,152
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, where did you get hit?</font>

93
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,352
<font color="yellow">Tell me honestly.</font>

94
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:01,052
<font color="yellow">Yes, your uncle will be a judge one day.</font>

95
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:04,552
<font color="yellow">He knows the law well. He studied it for a long time.</font>

96
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:06,052
<font color="yellow">But he fails the exam all the time.</font>

97
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,382
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the police.</font>

98
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,882
<font color="yellow">Where did you get hit? Your face?</font>

99
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,152
<font color="yellow">- Your legs? - No.</font>

100
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:16,482
<font color="yellow">Did she scratch you? Or did she pinch you?</font>

101
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:18,552
<font color="yellow">Not exactly.</font>

102
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:22,182
<font color="yellow">Look at her keeping silent.</font>

103
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:26,722
<font color="yellow">She's terrified to speak. She must have been abused so much.</font>

104
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:29,622
<font color="yellow">Did she starve you or something?</font>

105
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,582
<font color="yellow">- Did she starve you? - It's obvious.</font>

106
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:35,282
<font color="yellow">Why else would she have come all the way here?</font>

107
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,582
<font color="yellow">Stay out of this.</font>

108
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:39,222
<font color="yellow">- Let's go to the police. - Mum, that's not it.</font>

109
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,252
<font color="yellow">She hit me here.</font>

110
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:42,692
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

111
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,252
<font color="yellow">- Once like that? - Yes.</font>

112
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,622
<font color="yellow">That's still abuse.</font>

113
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:52,252
<font color="yellow">Why did she hit you?</font>

114
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,822
<font color="yellow">- Because of the make-up. - Make-up?</font>

115
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:57,152
<font color="yellow">Did you use her cosmetics?</font>

116
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:00,122
<font color="yellow">No. I used the cosmetics you bought me.</font>

117
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:02,152
<font color="yellow">She told me off for wearing make-up.</font>

118
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:04,122
<font color="yellow">She must be crazy.</font>

119
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:07,122
<font color="yellow">Who is she to tell you off?</font>

120
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:09,822
<font color="yellow">She didn't even buy it for you.</font>

121
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,382
<font color="yellow">She must be insane.</font>

122
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,482
<font color="yellow">Let's have a talk.</font>

123
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:19,752
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

124
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:21,822
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

125
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:23,622
<font color="yellow">You're the one who's insane.</font>

126
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:25,752
<font color="yellow">How could you buy a kid cosmetics?</font>

127
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,322
<font color="yellow">She's only in lower school.</font>

128
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:29,922
<font color="yellow">Do you want her to turn out like you?</font>

129
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,692
<font color="yellow">She wanted to buy it.</font>

130
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,352
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't let her buy everything she wants.</font>

131
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:37,722
<font color="yellow">That's why you're like this.</font>

132
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,822
<font color="yellow">You let Geum Sik use you. You still haven't come to senses.</font>

133
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,882
<font color="yellow">You're too old-fashioned.</font>

134
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:45,122
<font color="yellow">Kids all wear make-up these days.</font>

135
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:57,652
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

136
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:01,082
<font color="yellow">- I... - Say what you need to say.</font>

137
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:03,322
<font color="yellow">I just returned from Busan so I'm a bit busy.</font>

138
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,422
<font color="yellow">I think Cho Rong and Da Rong...</font>

139
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,082
<font color="yellow">went to see their mum.</font>

140
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:11,622
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

141
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,082
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

142
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:16,692
<font color="yellow">How could you let them go there? You know how much I hate it.</font>

143
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:19,082
<font color="yellow">I left the house for a little while and it happened.</font>

144
00:10:20,422 --> 00:10:22,482
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about the details when you return home.</font>

145
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,852
<font color="yellow">Please bring the kids home.</font>

146
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:27,152
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

147
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:39,952
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

148
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:41,452
<font color="yellow">Why did you take the kids?</font>

149
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:42,922
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

150
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:00,222
<font color="yellow">You said you'll take good care of them.</font>

151
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,052
<font color="yellow">Is this taking good care of them?</font>

152
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:04,622
<font color="yellow">If you're going to keep like this, let me raise the kids.</font>

153
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:06,522
<font color="yellow">- Who do you think you are? - Don't you know?</font>

154
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:08,852
<font color="yellow">I'm Cho Rong and Da Rong's mum.</font>

155
00:11:10,222 --> 00:11:11,422
<font color="yellow">Bring the kids to me.</font>

156
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,282
<font color="yellow">You have no say in this.</font>

157
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:16,222
<font color="yellow">Did you know the woman hit the kids?</font>

158
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,952
<font color="yellow">- What? - Good going.</font>

159
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:22,822
<font color="yellow">I won't send the kids home for a while. That's that.</font>

160
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,252
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

161
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:28,952
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

162
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:32,882
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

163
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:45,952
<font color="yellow">- Geum Sik. - A Young.</font>

164
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:48,182
<font color="yellow">You know where Cho Rong's grandmother lives, right?</font>

165
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:50,552
<font color="yellow">I've been there before. Why?</font>

166
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,152
<font color="yellow">Go there and bring the kids.</font>

167
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,252
<font color="yellow">Isn't it tasty?</font>

168
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:18,252
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Yes.</font>

169
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:19,622
<font color="yellow">- Grandmother, you're the best. - Grandmother, you're the best.</font>

170
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,852
<font color="yellow">Eat up, my babies.</font>

171
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:28,352
<font color="yellow">Try this too.</font>

172
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:39,122
<font color="yellow">Fried shrimps.</font>

173
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,622
<font color="yellow">It sounds delicious. Crunchy.</font>

174
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:44,522
<font color="yellow">Fried sweet potatoes.</font>

175
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:46,882
<font color="yellow">I love sweet potatoes.</font>

176
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:48,752
<font color="yellow">They're mixing jjajangmyeon.</font>

177
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:51,452
<font color="yellow">Stop announcing that. You're killing me.</font>

178
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,452
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam. Ma'am.</font>

179
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:56,852
<font color="yellow">That won't work.</font>

180
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,122
<font color="yellow">They won't invite us in.</font>

181
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,822
<font color="yellow">I can't hold back.</font>

182
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:06,222
<font color="yellow">We still have 12 tissues left.</font>

183
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,282
<font color="yellow">You seem dumb.</font>

184
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,352
<font color="yellow">Then, go to the main building yourself.</font>

185
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:12,952
<font color="yellow">Let's do rock-paper-scissors.</font>

186
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:15,152
<font color="yellow">Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

187
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:20,852
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

188
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:25,252
<font color="yellow">New toilet paper should be used for new food.</font>

189
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,182
<font color="yellow">- Good luck! - Good luck!</font>

<font color="yellow">(Nam Gi Ja)</font>

191
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,182
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

192
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:47,822
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

193
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:51,782
<font color="yellow">Is anyone home?</font>

194
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:00,952
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

195
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:10,182
<font color="yellow">Leave it out. I'm going to leave soon.</font>

196
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:13,522
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time since we last saw you.</font>

197
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,122
<font color="yellow">You've gotten so pretty.</font>

198
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:18,622
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here? - Let's go. Get up.</font>

199
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:20,952
<font color="yellow">Stay a little longer.</font>

200
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,352
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

201
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:26,082
<font color="yellow">- Get up now. - I don't want to.</font>

202
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,452
<font color="yellow">They're in the middle of eating.</font>

203
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:33,722
<font color="yellow">You seem like you just arrived. Why don't you join in?</font>

204
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:35,782
<font color="yellow">It's all right. I'll wait outside.</font>

205
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,482
<font color="yellow">Finish your food and come out quick.</font>

206
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:41,722
<font color="yellow">Why don't you stop ignoring me?</font>

207
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,052
<font color="yellow">We're not enemies, are we?</font>

208
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:45,122
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

209
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:46,782
<font color="yellow">You should address me politely.</font>

210
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,022
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

211
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:52,122
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 10 minuets.</font>

212
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:56,322
<font color="yellow">That girl is asking for it.</font>

213
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:58,122
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - Mum.</font>

214
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:03,522
<font color="yellow">She's out.</font>

215
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:08,622
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

216
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:11,552
<font color="yellow">- What if I get caught? - That's the end of it.</font>

217
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:15,522
<font color="yellow">Wait. She's doesn't know me.</font>

218
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:16,952
<font color="yellow">You're going to meet her later.</font>

219
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:21,222
<font color="yellow">How is she related to the folks at the main building?</font>

220
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:46,282
<font color="yellow">- I'm full. - Are you full?</font>

221
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:48,782
<font color="yellow">- Da Rong, are you full? - Yes.</font>

222
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,052
<font color="yellow">Are you all full?</font>

223
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:52,722
<font color="yellow">Then tell the folks at the annex building to come.</font>

224
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:54,522
<font color="yellow">They've been waiting for this.</font>

225
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,482
<font color="yellow">Come over.</font>

226
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:08,552
<font color="yellow">Is anyone there?</font>

227
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:14,952
<font color="yellow">Don't you want any?</font>

228
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,352
<font color="yellow">We do.</font>

229
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,722
<font color="yellow">We're dying to eat some.</font>

230
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:22,352
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

231
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,022
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

232
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:31,952
<font color="yellow">Can't you bring it over here?</font>

233
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,622
<font color="yellow">For two.</font>

234
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:48,622
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

235
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:51,022
<font color="yellow">They asked you to bring it?</font>

236
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:53,922
<font color="yellow">They have no wits.</font>

237
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:55,922
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving them so much?</font>

238
00:16:57,252 --> 00:16:59,322
<font color="yellow">- There you go. - Oh, my.</font>

239
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:04,382
<font color="yellow">Is this for two?</font>

240
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,222
<font color="yellow">Maybe he thought we wanted two pieces.</font>

241
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:11,622
<font color="yellow">Never eat food in a haste.</font>

242
00:17:11,952 --> 00:17:13,952
<font color="yellow">I know I'd look dumb.</font>

243
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:32,352
<font color="yellow">Be honest with me.</font>

244
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:34,322
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

245
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:36,582
<font color="yellow">hit Cho Rong?</font>

246
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:39,852
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Where? How?</font>

247
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,252
<font color="yellow">I should know.</font>

248
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:44,152
<font color="yellow">I just gave her a spanking...</font>

249
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:45,952
<font color="yellow">on her back.</font>

250
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:48,922
<font color="yellow">It happened in an instant.</font>

251
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:52,452
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have done it. I'm sorry.</font>

252
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,322
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

253
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:55,852
<font color="yellow">She was putting on make-up.</font>

254
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,392
<font color="yellow">Make-up?</font>

255
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:00,452
<font color="yellow">Did Cho Rong put on make-up?</font>

256
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:01,782
<font color="yellow">She recently started to.</font>

257
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:04,152
<font color="yellow">Her mother bought her cosmetics.</font>

258
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:08,652
<font color="yellow">I gave her a scolding that she's too young to wear make-up.</font>

259
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,222
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure it won't happen again.</font>

260
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:15,222
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

261
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:16,652
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

262
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:19,622
<font color="yellow">I will discipline Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

263
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:22,022
<font color="yellow">Whatever they do,</font>

264
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,422
<font color="yellow">just pretend you don't know.</font>

265
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:31,122
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

266
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:33,552
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

267
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:35,522
<font color="yellow">Go to your room and hold your hands up.</font>

268
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,552
<font color="yellow">Right now.</font>

269
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,852
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik. How could you let this happen?</font>

270
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:48,082
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong told me what happened on our way home.</font>

271
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:50,152
<font color="yellow">She said Jae Soon hit her.</font>

272
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:52,652
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

273
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,852
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you, Geum Sik.</font>

274
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:06,952
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

275
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:08,552
<font color="yellow">This isn't right.</font>

276
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:10,652
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't abuse the kids like this.</font>

277
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:13,852
<font color="yellow">I already talked to her about it. Stay out of it.</font>

278
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:16,082
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let them go to Da Hae's?</font>

279
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,452
<font color="yellow">I won't. It will never happen again.</font>

280
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:20,582
<font color="yellow">She might start to want something else.</font>

281
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:24,482
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - You know what I mean.</font>

282
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,322
<font color="yellow">She only wants to see the kids.</font>

283
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,222
<font color="yellow">I can't stop her from seeing them.</font>

284
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:30,682
<font color="yellow">She made a promise that she won't see them.</font>

285
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:31,892
<font color="yellow">Still.</font>

286
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,822
<font color="yellow">I will take care of it. Don't concern yourself.</font>

287
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,082
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten what she did to you?</font>

288
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:38,822
<font color="yellow">People don't change.</font>

289
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:41,682
<font color="yellow">I saw her in a long time, but she was still rude.</font>

290
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:44,422
<font color="yellow">Even the way she dresses and speaks is the same.</font>

291
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:46,552
<font color="yellow">What would the kids learn?</font>

292
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:50,722
<font color="yellow">When I think about the days you suffered and grew thin,</font>

293
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,222
<font color="yellow">my heart aches.</font>

294
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:55,152
<font color="yellow">You don't still have feelings for her, right?</font>

295
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:56,622
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

296
00:19:57,782 --> 00:19:59,782
<font color="yellow">- You know I... - You don't open up easily,</font>

297
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:01,622
<font color="yellow">but once you do, you give them your all.</font>

298
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,652
<font color="yellow">You knew she was crude,</font>

299
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,682
<font color="yellow">but you stayed with her because she's your first love.</font>

300
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:07,782
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

301
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:10,752
<font color="yellow">already married someone.</font>

302
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:25,252
<font color="yellow">She's your first love.</font>

303
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:28,552
<font color="yellow">You're going to fall for her if she seduces you, right?</font>

304
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,452
<font color="yellow">Drop some of them at the dry cleaner's,</font>

305
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:41,222
<font color="yellow">hand-wash the rest and iron them.</font>

306
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:43,352
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

307
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,452
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare lay hands on Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

308
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,122
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel bad for them?</font>

309
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,782
<font color="yellow">You're not their birth mother. Don't act like you are.</font>

310
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,582
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

311
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,892
<font color="yellow">You told me you got remarried because of the kids.</font>

312
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:06,422
<font color="yellow">That was an excuse.</font>

313
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:08,182
<font color="yellow">You want to drive them out...</font>

314
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:10,182
<font color="yellow">and have fun by yourselves, right?</font>

315
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,622
<font color="yellow">- Did she tell you to? - She's not like that.</font>

316
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:14,922
<font color="yellow">Look at that. You're siding with her.</font>

317
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:17,252
<font color="yellow">Let me raise them.</font>

318
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:18,752
<font color="yellow">You'll raise them poorly.</font>

319
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:20,452
<font color="yellow">I can't let you do that. Never.</font>

320
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:22,422
<font color="yellow">You gave up custody.</font>

321
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:23,952
<font color="yellow">That's when we got divorced.</font>

322
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,622
<font color="yellow">- Things are different now. - Nothing is different.</font>

323
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,082
<font color="yellow">Nothing at all.</font>

324
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:32,122
<font color="yellow">You're obligated to respect my visitor's right.</font>

325
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:33,282
<font color="yellow">Visitor's right?</font>

326
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,482
<font color="yellow">It's called visitation right.</font>

327
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:36,782
<font color="yellow">What a know-it-all.</font>

328
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:38,852
<font color="yellow">Let's follow the law.</font>

329
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,552
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

330
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:46,182
<font color="yellow">- Once in a month. - Four times.</font>

331
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:49,722
<font color="yellow">Twice.</font>

332
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:53,052
<font color="yellow">Only if you don't take them to your place.</font>

333
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,822
<font color="yellow">The taxi metre is still running, so let's keep it short.</font>

334
00:21:58,022 --> 00:21:59,152
<font color="yellow">Once a week.</font>

335
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,882
<font color="yellow">That's 4 times a month, and they get 1 sleep-over.</font>

336
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:04,482
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

337
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:21,522
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

338
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:27,852
<font color="yellow">Are you here to pick up Ddol Ee?</font>

339
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:29,652
<font color="yellow">Yes. How about you?</font>

340
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,482
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see Ddol Ee.</font>

341
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,152
<font color="yellow">Why did you pay for Se Gye's medicine?</font>

342
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:37,722
<font color="yellow">I'm his sister. Why can't I?</font>

343
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:38,882
<font color="yellow">Don't overspend on us.</font>

344
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:41,482
<font color="yellow">Stop buying us groceries, too.</font>

345
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:44,282
<font color="yellow">Is that credit card...</font>

346
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:46,482
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik's?</font>

347
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,182
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Then he must get...</font>

348
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:51,082
<font color="yellow">the notifications.</font>

349
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:53,282
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

350
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:54,582
<font color="yellow">Did you know about it?</font>

351
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:56,382
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

352
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:58,782
<font color="yellow">He set it just in case I lose it.</font>

353
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:00,522
<font color="yellow">I can use it freely.</font>

354
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:02,322
<font color="yellow">It's fine as long as you knew.</font>

355
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:06,122
<font color="yellow">From now on, stop spending money on us.</font>

356
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,322
<font color="yellow">We won't starve. Don't worry.</font>

357
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:12,722
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

358
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:14,482
<font color="yellow">about that picture.</font>

359
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:17,152
<font color="yellow">Picture? What picture?</font>

360
00:23:17,852 --> 00:23:18,852
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

361
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:21,722
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I'm going to go now.</font>

362
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,222
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to see Ddol Ee.</font>

363
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:35,752
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I was so harsh on you.</font>

364
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:38,652
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I punched you.</font>

365
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:41,522
<font color="yellow">You and Gab Soon are completely broken up, right?</font>

366
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:46,782
<font color="yellow">Both of your families are against it.</font>

367
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:48,252
<font color="yellow">You won't make it.</font>

368
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,922
<font color="yellow">Call me sometimes.</font>

369
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:54,222
<font color="yellow">You used to call me often.</font>

370
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:56,552
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

371
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:58,652
<font color="yellow">Let's drink this and go.</font>

372
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:01,222
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

373
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:04,182
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with everything.</font>

374
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:07,382
<font color="yellow">I'm fine if we broke up,</font>

375
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:09,852
<font color="yellow">and I'm fine if we can't get married.</font>

376
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:14,552
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

377
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,222
<font color="yellow">it hurts so badly here.</font>

378
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,622
<font color="yellow">I kept thinking about how I treated Gab Soon so poorly.</font>

379
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,552
<font color="yellow">She waited for me to pass the exam for 10 years.</font>

380
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:34,952
<font color="yellow">She worked part-time to feed me.</font>

381
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,882
<font color="yellow">She couldn't buy cosmetics because she wanted to buy me tonkatsu.</font>

382
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:45,052
<font color="yellow">She couldn't wear skirts because she wanted to buy me gimbap.</font>

383
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:50,022
<font color="yellow">I haven't done anything for her.</font>

384
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:53,052
<font color="yellow">I've never...</font>

385
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,282
<font color="yellow">celebrated our anniversary or her birthday.</font>

386
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,522
<font color="yellow">I gave her paper cranes on her birthday.</font>

387
00:25:00,952 --> 00:25:03,422
<font color="yellow">I heard girls hate that.</font>

388
00:25:06,282 --> 00:25:07,852
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon looked happy,</font>

389
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,052
<font color="yellow">so I thought she was really happy.</font>

390
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:13,622
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

391
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,482
<font color="yellow">Why did Gab Soon date someone like me?</font>

392
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:20,322
<font color="yellow">I don't know that.</font>

393
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:22,952
<font color="yellow">If I pass,</font>

394
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:27,822
<font color="yellow">I'll take Gab Soon to an expensive restaurant.</font>

395
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,252
<font color="yellow">I won't look at the price.</font>

396
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,852
<font color="yellow">I'll say,</font>

397
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:38,752
<font color="yellow">"Order anything you like",</font>

398
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:45,222
<font color="yellow">and buy her the most expensive food.</font>

399
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:48,522
<font color="yellow">She told me that's her...</font>

400
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:50,622
<font color="yellow">long-standing wish.</font>

401
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:53,322
<font color="yellow">My dear Gab Soon.</font>

402
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:56,722
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

403
00:25:57,552 --> 00:26:00,282
<font color="yellow">Remember that feeling and pass the exam.</font>

404
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:02,882
<font color="yellow">Think of this as...</font>

405
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:05,622
<font color="yellow">one of the memories...</font>

406
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,222
<font color="yellow">and a shining jewel in life.</font>

407
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:10,752
<font color="yellow">All right?</font>

408
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:12,282
<font color="yellow">A jewel.</font>

409
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:19,452
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, Gab Soon.</font>

410
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:24,122
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you a diamond ring that costs 20,000 dollars.</font>

411
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,452
<font color="yellow">You're drunk. Let's go.</font>

412
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:30,122
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

413
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,152
<font color="yellow">More than anything,</font>

414
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:38,622
<font color="yellow">it's so hard to live without Gab Soon.</font>

415
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,882
<font color="yellow">I miss her so much,</font>

416
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:48,122
<font color="yellow">but I can't call her because it might make her sad.</font>

417
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:08,952
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

418
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:13,752
<font color="yellow">My dear Gab Soon.</font>

419
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:20,452
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon!</font>

420
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:32,152
<font color="yellow">White shark, blue shark</font>

421
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:35,952
<font color="yellow">I play gently because I'm scared</font>

422
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:39,822
<font color="yellow">White shark, blue shark</font>

423
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:06,022
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

424
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:11,122
<font color="yellow">Don't greet anyone in our family.</font>

425
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,952
<font color="yellow">Pretend you don't know us.</font>

426
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:14,582
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

427
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:16,582
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

428
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,322
<font color="yellow">It'll be great if you can move.</font>

429
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,482
<font color="yellow">Did you see Gab Dol?</font>

430
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:32,952
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

431
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:35,822
<font color="yellow">Don't say his name. It brings me bad luck.</font>

432
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:38,222
<font color="yellow">But Gab Soon's name sounds similar.</font>

433
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:40,582
<font color="yellow">Don't tell her you saw Gab Dol.</font>

434
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:44,152
<font color="yellow">Don't stir up her mind.</font>

435
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:58,252
<font color="yellow">You're right on time.</font>

436
00:28:58,252 --> 00:28:59,952
<font color="yellow">Sit down, Mum. You, too, Aunt.</font>

437
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:03,382
<font color="yellow">So this is the lunch you prepared. It looks nice.</font>

438
00:29:04,552 --> 00:29:05,952
<font color="yellow">Come out, Dad.</font>

439
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:08,282
<font color="yellow">We were on our way home, and we saw Gab Dol...</font>

440
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,252
<font color="yellow">Actually, we didn't.</font>

441
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:16,352
<font color="yellow">I was saying we didn't see anyone like Gab Dol. It's true.</font>

442
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:21,022
<font color="yellow">What's all this? It smells good.</font>

443
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:22,682
<font color="yellow">It's pasta.</font>

444
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:25,882
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon lightened up the mood.</font>

445
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:28,952
<font color="yellow">I can hear her wailing</font>

446
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:31,752
<font color="yellow">No, no. I'll be quiet.</font>

447
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:34,152
<font color="yellow">Can't I just have rice?</font>

448
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:38,152
<font color="yellow">You're so old-fashioned. Just try it.</font>

449
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:39,782
<font color="yellow">Just eat what we give you...</font>

450
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:42,682
<font color="yellow">without complaining. You talk too much.</font>

451
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:44,082
<font color="yellow">I hate men like that.</font>

452
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,222
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You've been married to him...</font>

453
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:48,782
<font color="yellow">all these years and now you hate him?</font>

454
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:52,682
<font color="yellow">- I'll get you some rice. - Don't. I can eat this.</font>

455
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:57,782
<font color="yellow">Roll it up like this. Haven't you seen it?</font>

456
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:01,422
<font color="yellow">Just eat it as you like.</font>

457
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:02,952
<font color="yellow">Don't spill.</font>

458
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:04,752
<font color="yellow">He hasn't even taken a bite yet.</font>

459
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:07,522
<font color="yellow">You always spill on your belly.</font>

460
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,952
<font color="yellow">- Hold your belly in. - Stop nagging.</font>

461
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,652
<font color="yellow">If I could control it, I wouldn't live like this.</font>

462
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,582
<font color="yellow">- It's delicious. - That's good.</font>

463
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,652
<font color="yellow">Dad, let's have a can of beer, okay?</font>

464
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,682
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

465
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:23,922
<font color="yellow">I went out and got them earlier.</font>

466
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,682
<font color="yellow">She's okay, right?</font>

467
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:31,222
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell? She's relieved she broke up with him.</font>

468
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:32,822
<font color="yellow">I would feel the same way.</font>

469
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:34,752
<font color="yellow">Nobody knows that.</font>

470
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:38,222
<font color="yellow">They were together for 10 years. They might get back together.</font>

471
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:39,582
<font color="yellow">Stop scaring me.</font>

472
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:42,482
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

473
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:46,152
<font color="yellow">Why isn't there soju?</font>

474
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:47,522
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

475
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:49,622
<font color="yellow">Where is the sauce?</font>

476
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,652
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so old-fashioned.</font>

477
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:53,482
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. I'm old-fashioned. - Just eat with this.</font>

478
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:55,422
<font color="yellow">I've been a wanderer, so I don't know food.</font>

479
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:56,852
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - Joong Nyeon.</font>

480
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:58,952
<font color="yellow">- Pour me a glass. - All right.</font>

481
00:30:58,952 --> 00:30:59,952
<font color="yellow">What about you, Mum?</font>

482
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:08,322
<font color="yellow">- He's here! - Is he?</font>

483
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:14,522
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he's so cool.</font>

484
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:26,122
<font color="yellow">- He's handsome. - Oh, my.</font>

485
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:08,722
<font color="yellow">Don't greet anyone in our family.</font>

486
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:11,022
<font color="yellow">What if anyone finds out you lived together?</font>

487
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:13,782
<font color="yellow">Don't you come anywhere near Gab Soon.</font>

488
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:15,652
<font color="yellow">It'll be great if you can move.</font>

489
00:32:23,882 --> 00:32:24,922
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

490
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:26,922
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

491
00:32:48,422 --> 00:32:50,182
<font color="yellow">Let her be confused.</font>

492
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:52,422
<font color="yellow">Let her feel uneasy.</font>

493
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:54,552
<font color="yellow">Let her wonder.</font>

494
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:55,782
<font color="yellow">Life makes you suffer...</font>

495
00:32:57,582 --> 00:33:00,382
<font color="yellow">Sausage stew. Underline the word, "sausage stew".</font>

496
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:02,282
<font color="yellow">Underlining "sausage stew".</font>

497
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,722
<font color="yellow">Is the title "Sausage Stew"?</font>

498
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:08,922
<font color="yellow">The title was "Men" at first, but I changed it to "Sausage Stew".</font>

499
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:10,082
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

500
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,722
<font color="yellow">When did you write this poem?</font>

501
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:14,952
<font color="yellow">When I was in the army.</font>

502
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:18,122
<font color="yellow">In the army, we had football matches between troops,</font>

503
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,282
<font color="yellow">and we bonded with each other while eating sausage stew.</font>

504
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:24,152
<font color="yellow">In the sausage stew restaurant my friend owns,</font>

505
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:26,222
<font color="yellow">the whole troop used to have a get-together. On those days,</font>

506
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:27,652
<font color="yellow">I'd feel sick to my stomach.</font>

507
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:30,152
<font color="yellow">I tell myself I won't have sausage stew ever again,</font>

508
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:32,152
<font color="yellow">but looking at that restaurant...</font>

509
00:33:32,152 --> 00:33:34,652
<font color="yellow">makes me want to have sausage stew again.</font>

510
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:37,022
<font color="yellow">I want to eat sausage stew, too.</font>

511
00:33:37,822 --> 00:33:40,322
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat, then. - I'd like to, but...</font>

512
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:42,952
<font color="yellow">You'll get sick if you don't eat things you crave. Let's eat it.</font>

513
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:45,122
<font color="yellow">You don't like food like that.</font>

514
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:46,422
<font color="yellow">It's embarrassing.</font>

515
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:48,522
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

516
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:51,252
<font color="yellow">What's embarrassing about enjoying sausage stew?</font>

517
00:33:51,882 --> 00:33:53,382
<font color="yellow">I'm an ordinary person, too.</font>

518
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,382
<font color="yellow">I like sausage stew, I want to eat it...</font>

519
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:58,722
<font color="yellow">and I miss its taste so badly that it makes me sick.</font>

520
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,582
<font color="yellow">You're so cute sometimes.</font>

521
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:05,082
<font color="yellow">You're only saying that not to embarrass me, right?</font>

522
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:15,882
<font color="yellow">Do you have sausage stew ramyeon?</font>

523
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,652
<font color="yellow">Why is the laundry here?</font>

524
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:48,182
<font color="yellow">She took it out here so she can ask...</font>

525
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:49,322
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo to do it.</font>

526
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:53,152
<font color="yellow">Don't do that. She doesn't know how to do anything.</font>

527
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:56,292
<font color="yellow">I already had Jae Soon and did chores at her age.</font>

528
00:34:57,422 --> 00:34:59,822
<font color="yellow">Kids these days hate to hear things like that.</font>

529
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:02,552
<font color="yellow">Be half as good as you are to Gong Joo.</font>

530
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,292
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she here yet?</font>

531
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:15,252
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

532
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:19,722
<font color="yellow">Hello? Who is this?</font>

533
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:21,882
<font color="yellow">- It's me. - Who?</font>

534
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,622
<font color="yellow">- Who are you? - I can't believe this girl.</font>

535
00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:26,022
<font color="yellow">"Who are you?"</font>

536
00:35:26,152 --> 00:35:28,052
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

537
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:31,152
<font color="yellow">Because you're poor,</font>

538
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:33,422
<font color="yellow">she didn't even bother to save your number.</font>

539
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:36,022
<font color="yellow">Didn't you save your mother-in-law's number?</font>

540
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:40,082
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

541
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:42,082
<font color="yellow">I told you to come and pick up Se Gye's medicine.</font>

542
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:44,082
<font color="yellow">Come over now.</font>

543
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:56,682
<font color="yellow">Cook rice.</font>

544
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:59,552
<font color="yellow">I've never done that.</font>

545
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:02,052
<font color="yellow">- That's why I want you to do it. - I can't.</font>

546
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:05,182
<font color="yellow">Just try it. I won't scold you.</font>

547
00:36:05,852 --> 00:36:08,322
<font color="yellow">Frankly, Gab Soon can't cook rice, either.</font>

548
00:36:08,322 --> 00:36:09,922
<font color="yellow">Of course she can.</font>

549
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:11,082
<font color="yellow">She cooked for us.</font>

550
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:13,622
<font color="yellow">That's not rice. Those were noodles.</font>

551
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:14,792
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

552
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:17,752
<font color="yellow">I want to eat the rice my daughter-in-law cooked for me.</font>

553
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:20,052
<font color="yellow">Stir it and wash it.</font>

554
00:36:27,222 --> 00:36:28,322
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

555
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,152
<font color="yellow">You should stick your hand in and stir.</font>

556
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:32,582
<font color="yellow">Don't just stir water.</font>

557
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:36,482
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

558
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:38,882
<font color="yellow">Drain the water. You should repeat it several times.</font>

559
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:44,052
<font color="yellow">Don't spill the rice. Just pour out the water.</font>

560
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:45,322
<font color="yellow">Fill it with water again.</font>

561
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:48,382
<font color="yellow">Wash it.</font>

562
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,352
<font color="yellow">Drain.</font>

563
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:53,952
<font color="yellow">You're wasting all the rice.</font>

564
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:57,222
<font color="yellow">Why can't you do anything?</font>

565
00:36:57,452 --> 00:36:59,582
<font color="yellow">Stop it. You're going to make her cry.</font>

566
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:01,122
<font color="yellow">You've been married to Se Gye for a year now.</font>

567
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:04,792
<font color="yellow">You haven't even cooked rice or soup for me.</font>

568
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:07,252
<font color="yellow">I'm just unlucky to have you as my daughter-in-law.</font>

569
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:08,752
<font color="yellow">Who can I blame?</font>

570
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:10,182
<font color="yellow">Leave it.</font>

571
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:11,952
<font color="yellow">When are you going to have a baby?</font>

572
00:37:12,682 --> 00:37:14,422
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

573
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:16,922
<font color="yellow">You can't have a baby?</font>

574
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,152
<font color="yellow">I've never given birth before.</font>

575
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,882
<font color="yellow">Listen to that.</font>

576
00:37:23,222 --> 00:37:25,952
<font color="yellow">Of course you haven't given birth before.</font>

577
00:37:26,522 --> 00:37:28,182
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

578
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:30,622
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you can't do it?</font>

579
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:35,022
<font color="yellow">You always say, "I can't do that."</font>

580
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,292
<font color="yellow">It must be your favourite thing to say.</font>

581
00:37:37,682 --> 00:37:39,482
<font color="yellow">How did you get married, then?</font>

582
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:41,292
<font color="yellow">My grandpa told me to.</font>

583
00:37:41,382 --> 00:37:43,792
<font color="yellow">Would you have a baby if your grandpa told you to?</font>

584
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:45,682
<font color="yellow">Let me ask my mum.</font>

585
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:49,082
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. You have to ask your mum about that?</font>

586
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:51,652
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

587
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:52,792
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

588
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:56,922
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

589
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:07,352
<font color="yellow">Be careful, Ms Nam. You're going to break everything.</font>

590
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:08,652
<font color="yellow">Just eat.</font>

591
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:21,882
<font color="yellow">Does it suit your appetite?</font>

592
00:38:22,322 --> 00:38:23,322
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

593
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:24,952
<font color="yellow">Is it too salty or bland?</font>

594
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,052
<font color="yellow">I said it's fine.</font>

595
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:28,952
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

596
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:31,422
<font color="yellow">Are you saying it's salty or bland?</font>

597
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,182
<font color="yellow">- Ms Nam. - Get me some salt.</font>

598
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,422
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like that?</font>

599
00:38:39,622 --> 00:38:42,752
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? He asked for salt so I gave it to him.</font>

600
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,582
<font color="yellow">If you're done cooking, you can leave and rest.</font>

601
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:51,752
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, Dad? Why are you not yelling at her?</font>

602
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:53,352
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

603
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:55,792
<font color="yellow">Don't be noisy while I eat.</font>

604
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:58,352
<font color="yellow">- Where's Gong Joo? - She's at her in-laws.</font>

605
00:38:59,082 --> 00:39:00,852
<font color="yellow">I wonder what they're making her do.</font>

606
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,552
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

607
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:09,352
<font color="yellow">I just arrived.</font>

608
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:11,882
<font color="yellow">Bring Gong Joo back. Don't take too long.</font>

609
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:13,552
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ms Yeo.</font>

610
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,422
<font color="yellow">Eat first. I won't take long.</font>

611
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:21,552
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, let's go home.</font>

612
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:24,022
<font color="yellow">They almost killed me.</font>

613
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:25,482
<font color="yellow">Let's eat first.</font>

614
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,122
<font color="yellow">Can't we eat at home?</font>

615
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:28,252
<font color="yellow">No, we can't.</font>

616
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:30,122
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

617
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:42,852
<font color="yellow">See you later, Se Gye. Bye, Gong Joo.</font>

618
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:44,152
<font color="yellow">Bye, Gab Soon.</font>

619
00:39:44,522 --> 00:39:45,582
<font color="yellow">Wait, Gab Soon.</font>

620
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:46,882
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

621
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:55,722
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

622
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:57,952
<font color="yellow">I am good as you see.</font>

623
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:00,152
<font color="yellow">You're brave.</font>

624
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:03,682
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you think I was going to cry to death?</font>

625
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:07,122
<font color="yellow">If you think about it, women are tougher than men.</font>

626
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:08,652
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

627
00:40:10,422 --> 00:40:12,222
<font color="yellow">Don't hate Gab Dol too much.</font>

628
00:40:13,082 --> 00:40:14,222
<font color="yellow">He's thoughtful.</font>

629
00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:16,752
<font color="yellow">Did you see him?</font>

630
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:20,052
<font color="yellow">- We had soju together. - Why would you?</font>

631
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,052
<font color="yellow">It had nothing to do with you.</font>

632
00:40:22,522 --> 00:40:23,882
<font color="yellow">I've known him since we were young.</font>

633
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,822
<font color="yellow">He may look immature and inconsiderate,</font>

634
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:29,792
<font color="yellow">but he's not a bad guy.</font>

635
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:33,152
<font color="yellow">He was crying over the fact that he wasn't good to you.</font>

636
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:35,522
<font color="yellow">Lunatic.</font>

637
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:39,682
<font color="yellow">He says he'll come back once he passes the exam.</font>

638
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,522
<font color="yellow">He wants to take you to an expensive restaurant...</font>

639
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:45,352
<font color="yellow">and buy you steak without worrying about the price.</font>

640
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,952
<font color="yellow">He couldn't buy you proper gifts for your anniversaries...</font>

641
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,582
<font color="yellow">and made you paper cranes instead.</font>

642
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:53,852
<font color="yellow">He was crying because he felt bad about it.</font>

643
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:56,622
<font color="yellow">I felt sad for him.</font>

644
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:58,852
<font color="yellow">He said he didn't know.</font>

645
00:40:59,952 --> 00:41:01,152
<font color="yellow">What do you mean he didn't know?</font>

646
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:04,322
<font color="yellow">What kind of a guy doesn't know that women like luxury bags?</font>

647
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:06,882
<font color="yellow">He just didn't want to buy them.</font>

648
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:10,552
<font color="yellow">It's not that he didn't want to. He couldn't afford it.</font>

649
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:13,722
<font color="yellow">If he really wanted to, he could have found ways to afford it.</font>

650
00:41:14,582 --> 00:41:16,722
<font color="yellow">It sounds like you broke up with him because he couldn't get you a bag.</font>

651
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,352
<font color="yellow">I've just had enough.</font>

652
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:22,482
<font color="yellow">After 10 years of dating, there's nothing left.</font>

653
00:41:23,352 --> 00:41:24,792
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed to see my friends.</font>

654
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:26,452
<font color="yellow">That's not like you.</font>

655
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,822
<font color="yellow">It's over already.</font>

656
00:41:30,752 --> 00:41:33,452
<font color="yellow">Don't detest him or speak ill of him.</font>

657
00:41:34,822 --> 00:41:36,482
<font color="yellow">Consider this as a good memory.</font>

658
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:39,752
<font color="yellow">It's the worst thing to speak ill of your ex-boyfriend.</font>

659
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:48,622
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going. - Okay, see you.</font>

660
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:04,722
<font color="yellow">He was crying over the fact that he wasn't good to you.</font>

661
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,552
<font color="yellow">Even if he misses you, he can't call you because he feels bad.</font>

662
00:42:09,422 --> 00:42:10,822
<font color="yellow">Consider this as a good memory.</font>

663
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:36,552
<font color="yellow">What did she say?</font>

664
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:38,682
<font color="yellow">She wants me to have a baby.</font>

665
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:40,222
<font color="yellow">She told you that?</font>

666
00:42:40,252 --> 00:42:42,822
<font color="yellow">Of course she did. Would she tell Se Gye to have a baby?</font>

667
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:45,822
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about it. Why aren't you having a baby?</font>

668
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:47,292
<font color="yellow">What should I do, Mum?</font>

669
00:42:47,352 --> 00:42:49,252
<font color="yellow">It's not time, yet. You're still young.</font>

670
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:51,352
<font color="yellow">She's not young. She's 24.</font>

671
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:54,452
<font color="yellow">Dad, I had her at that age and it almost killed me.</font>

672
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,022
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have to settle like me. Have fun.</font>

673
00:42:57,752 --> 00:43:00,082
<font color="yellow">And you didn't have fun? You had as much fun as you wanted.</font>

674
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:01,582
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any fun.</font>

675
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:03,552
<font color="yellow">You were so busy having fun that you quit high school.</font>

676
00:43:03,652 --> 00:43:05,752
<font color="yellow">Dad, why? They are watching.</font>

677
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:07,882
<font color="yellow">It's time for your medication.</font>

678
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,482
<font color="yellow">Go inside and have your medication, Dad.</font>

679
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:17,922
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

680
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:19,482
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

681
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:21,322
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.</font>

682
00:43:22,322 --> 00:43:24,652
<font color="yellow">A woman's heart is as fickle as a reed.</font>

683
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:26,682
<font color="yellow">You can't.</font>

684
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:29,682
<font color="yellow">Don't do this. Don't ask no more.</font>

685
00:43:30,722 --> 00:43:32,052
<font color="yellow">Your poems make me feel like...</font>

686
00:43:32,222 --> 00:43:35,852
<font color="yellow">I'm drinking banana-flavoured milk after getting out of the sauna.</font>

687
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:37,752
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

688
00:43:37,922 --> 00:43:39,852
<font color="yellow">I'm at bed by this hour.</font>

689
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:42,082
<font color="yellow">Same here.</font>

690
00:43:45,152 --> 00:43:46,722
<font color="yellow">What are you wearing?</font>

691
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:50,582
<font color="yellow">I'm wearing pyjamas.</font>

692
00:43:51,652 --> 00:43:52,882
<font color="yellow">What colour is it?</font>

693
00:43:54,452 --> 00:43:55,452
<font color="yellow">It's pink.</font>

694
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:58,652
<font color="yellow">Professor, can you recite another poem for me?</font>

695
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:12,252
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon, this one looks good.</font>

696
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:14,022
<font color="yellow">It looks good.</font>

697
00:44:16,282 --> 00:44:17,722
<font color="yellow">You have a good eye.</font>

698
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:20,222
<font color="yellow">You should find a man like that.</font>

699
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:23,952
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Who looks for a man in the trash?</font>

700
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,022
<font color="yellow">What happened to you?</font>

701
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:32,422
<font color="yellow">You were so clean.</font>

702
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:35,082
<font color="yellow">Don't take pity on me. This is fun.</font>

703
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,452
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

704
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:39,522
<font color="yellow">You should talk back to your wife.</font>

705
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:43,282
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for you.</font>

706
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:45,552
<font color="yellow">I feel worse for you.</font>

707
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:47,152
<font color="yellow">What would you do when I'm gone?</font>

708
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:48,682
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

709
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:52,322
<font color="yellow">I feel sad watching you.</font>

710
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:55,022
<font color="yellow">So you should straighten things out.</font>

711
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:57,882
<font color="yellow">- The men you used to see... - Stop!</font>

712
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:00,522
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of my life.</font>

713
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:05,452
<font color="yellow">Is this a married couple going through the garbage together?</font>

714
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:09,222
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. People say that all the time.</font>

715
00:45:09,322 --> 00:45:11,182
<font color="yellow">I hate hearing that.</font>

716
00:45:11,282 --> 00:45:14,482
<font color="yellow">You were always stuck to your brother like glue.</font>

717
00:45:14,652 --> 00:45:15,652
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

718
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:18,622
<font color="yellow">Do you not like him any more because he's bold and wrinkly?</font>

719
00:45:18,852 --> 00:45:21,952
<font color="yellow">You can play with these but make sure you put them back.</font>

720
00:45:22,182 --> 00:45:23,422
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten, Mal Nyeon?</font>

721
00:45:24,082 --> 00:45:25,922
<font color="yellow">Even on our first night,</font>

722
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:28,952
<font color="yellow">you won't get away from Joong Nyeon so you slept with us.</font>

723
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:30,552
<font color="yellow">That's unbelievable.</font>

724
00:45:31,322 --> 00:45:32,382
<font color="yellow">You did.</font>

725
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:36,582
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

726
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:43,522
<font color="yellow">The daughter of the sauna owner got divorced.</font>

727
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:45,582
<font color="yellow">Again?</font>

728
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:47,082
<font color="yellow">Was that her third divorce?</font>

729
00:45:47,452 --> 00:45:48,452
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

730
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:50,522
<font color="yellow">- For what? - Because of the ex-wife.</font>

731
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,952
<font color="yellow">The ex-wife and the kids would come to the house...</font>

732
00:45:53,152 --> 00:45:56,152
<font color="yellow">and talk him into things. They kicked her out...</font>

733
00:45:56,352 --> 00:45:59,052
<font color="yellow">and the husband got back with the ex-wife. She has two daughters.</font>

734
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:00,252
<font color="yellow">That's how things are.</font>

735
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:02,622
<font color="yellow">You just have to feed boys...</font>

736
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,782
<font color="yellow">but girls are picky so they're hard to please.</font>

737
00:46:05,882 --> 00:46:07,852
<font color="yellow">Maybe they're going through puberty.</font>

738
00:46:08,952 --> 00:46:11,722
<font color="yellow">You should also try your best not to hurt the girls.</font>

739
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:13,182
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

740
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:15,482
<font color="yellow">Don't try so hard to impress them.</font>

741
00:46:15,582 --> 00:46:17,182
<font color="yellow">Consider them as your own...</font>

742
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:19,552
<font color="yellow">and be strict on certain things.</font>

743
00:46:20,122 --> 00:46:22,052
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong is not easy to handle.</font>

744
00:46:22,222 --> 00:46:24,522
<font color="yellow">Kids these days don't even listen to their own parents.</font>

745
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,382
<font color="yellow">You have to talk to them gently when you can.</font>

746
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:28,122
<font color="yellow">Does his ex-wife come once in a while?</font>

747
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:29,722
<font color="yellow">She doesn't.</font>

748
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:32,852
<font color="yellow">He promised me in the beginning and said that won't happen.</font>

749
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:35,852
<font color="yellow">You never know. They might be meeting each other in secret.</font>

750
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:38,422
<font color="yellow">Daughters are drawn to their mums.</font>

751
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:41,322
<font color="yellow">You registered your marriage, right?</font>

752
00:46:41,522 --> 00:46:42,882
<font color="yellow">They did it when they were getting married.</font>

753
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,352
<font color="yellow">Is Ddol Ee on your family register as well?</font>

754
00:46:46,422 --> 00:46:47,422
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

755
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:49,682
<font color="yellow">You have to if you want to send him to school next year.</font>

756
00:46:49,782 --> 00:46:51,552
<font color="yellow">That shouldn't be done so easily.</font>

757
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:53,322
<font color="yellow">You can't just change his last name like that.</font>

758
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:56,482
<font color="yellow">You have to if the circumstance calls for it. It's just last name.</font>

759
00:46:56,822 --> 00:46:59,052
<font color="yellow">It doesn't look good if his last name is different from the girls.</font>

760
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,552
<font color="yellow">They'll be going to the same school.</font>

761
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:04,052
<font color="yellow">It's better to add Ddol Ee on the family register as his own.</font>

762
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:05,922
<font color="yellow">Changing the last name won't make Ddol Ee his own.</font>

763
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,322
<font color="yellow">Even if Ddol Ee was to be born again, he won't be their family.</font>

764
00:47:09,622 --> 00:47:10,952
<font color="yellow">Do you want to change his last name...</font>

765
00:47:10,952 --> 00:47:13,152
<font color="yellow">and be hypocritical by saying that it's a perfect family?</font>

766
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:15,682
<font color="yellow">That's not being hypocritical. Did you have to put it that way?</font>

767
00:47:15,852 --> 00:47:19,752
<font color="yellow">You don't even know how long Geum Sik and Jae Soon will last.</font>

768
00:47:20,282 --> 00:47:22,682
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get married again if you find a richer man?</font>

769
00:47:22,682 --> 00:47:23,952
<font color="yellow">Are you cursing at her?</font>

770
00:47:23,952 --> 00:47:26,682
<font color="yellow">I know a woman who changed her kid's last name twice.</font>

771
00:47:27,022 --> 00:47:28,922
<font color="yellow">The kid eventually took the mum's last name.</font>

772
00:47:29,152 --> 00:47:30,952
<font color="yellow">You should make your sister watch what she says.</font>

773
00:47:31,122 --> 00:47:32,122
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

774
00:47:32,452 --> 00:47:34,222
<font color="yellow">I'm just stating a fact.</font>

775
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:36,822
<font color="yellow">I'm telling the truth.</font>

776
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:38,152
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

777
00:47:40,082 --> 00:47:42,722
<font color="yellow">You should be prudent. This has to do with Ddol Ee's future.</font>

778
00:47:44,052 --> 00:47:46,452
<font color="yellow">You didn't see your divorce coming...</font>

779
00:47:46,682 --> 00:47:48,552
<font color="yellow">and you can never predict what's ahead of you.</font>

780
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:52,252
<font color="yellow">Don't think about yourself. Think about Ddol Ee first.</font>

781
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:54,852
<font color="yellow">Think about what would happen when he grows up.</font>

782
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:57,782
<font color="yellow">It's about his sense of identity.</font>

783
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:00,822
<font color="yellow">He's still young and doesn't know anything...</font>

784
00:48:01,352 --> 00:48:02,882
<font color="yellow">but don't try to hurt him.</font>

785
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,682
<font color="yellow">He's so inflexible.</font>

786
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:10,152
<font color="yellow">Don't you think kids will make fun of him at school...</font>

787
00:48:10,152 --> 00:48:12,552
<font color="yellow">if his last name is different from the girls?</font>

788
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:16,052
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee has nothing to lose by being registered as Geum Sik's son.</font>

789
00:48:16,582 --> 00:48:19,122
<font color="yellow">It'll be great if Ddol Ee inherits his estate, too.</font>

790
00:48:19,222 --> 00:48:20,822
<font color="yellow">Would he?</font>

791
00:48:21,822 --> 00:48:25,582
<font color="yellow">I see. That's worth doing, then.</font>

792
00:48:26,582 --> 00:48:29,822
<font color="yellow">You're so clever.</font>

793
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:41,182
<font color="yellow">- Don't! - Waive, give me a second.</font>

794
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:44,852
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

795
00:48:45,082 --> 00:48:46,352
<font color="yellow">Try this.</font>

796
00:48:51,552 --> 00:48:53,282
<font color="yellow">Come here!</font>

797
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:56,252
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty.</font>

798
00:48:58,282 --> 00:48:59,322
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

799
00:49:02,452 --> 00:49:03,822
<font color="yellow">Keep it down.</font>

800
00:49:05,952 --> 00:49:08,082
<font color="yellow">I'm studying so keep it down.</font>

801
00:49:08,182 --> 00:49:10,722
<font color="yellow">You were having fun all this time. Why are you studying now?</font>

802
00:49:10,722 --> 00:49:11,722
<font color="yellow">Why are you studying?</font>

803
00:49:12,752 --> 00:49:14,122
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Da Hae.</font>

804
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,222
<font color="yellow">I have to pass this time.</font>

805
00:49:16,322 --> 00:49:18,152
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. I didn't stop you.</font>

806
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:20,352
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead. - You can do it, Uncle!</font>

807
00:49:20,422 --> 00:49:21,452
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

808
00:49:21,452 --> 00:49:22,722
<font color="yellow">- Quiet. - Quiet.</font>

809
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,422
<font color="yellow">It's not like we stopped him, right?</font>

810
00:49:30,422 --> 00:49:31,852
<font color="yellow">- Let me see. - He can do it.</font>

811
00:49:31,852 --> 00:49:32,922
<font color="yellow">He can, right?</font>

812
00:49:36,152 --> 00:49:37,352
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

813
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:54,652
<font color="yellow">Say, "Hello, Dad."</font>

814
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:01,222
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

815
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:05,952
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dad.</font>

816
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:09,452
<font color="yellow">What were you doing, Ddol Ee?</font>

817
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:11,682
<font color="yellow">- I was watching the television. - Were you?</font>

818
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:14,252
<font color="yellow">I made some soup. Do you want to take a shower first?</font>

819
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:17,582
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Would you like a drink?</font>

820
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,082
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

821
00:50:20,422 --> 00:50:21,582
<font color="yellow">Take a shower, then.</font>

822
00:51:11,452 --> 00:51:14,422
<font color="yellow">- It's me. - What is it, Geum Sik?</font>

823
00:51:15,482 --> 00:51:17,252
<font color="yellow">The girls are here.</font>

824
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:18,882
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

825
00:51:19,922 --> 00:51:22,082
<font color="yellow">We were about to eat dinner.</font>

826
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:25,052
<font color="yellow">I'll pick them up by 10pm.</font>

827
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:27,222
<font color="yellow">Please have them finish by then.</font>

828
00:51:27,222 --> 00:51:29,522
<font color="yellow">I was going to have them sleep over.</font>

829
00:51:29,682 --> 00:51:31,022
<font color="yellow">Is that not possible?</font>

830
00:51:31,152 --> 00:51:33,882
<font color="yellow">I'll pick them up. I'll call you back.</font>

831
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:38,122
<font color="yellow">Is he out of his mind?</font>

832
00:51:38,452 --> 00:51:40,352
<font color="yellow">I said I was going to have them sleep over.</font>

833
00:51:40,352 --> 00:51:41,552
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth.</font>

834
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:43,422
<font color="yellow">Do you want Geum Sik to lose his mind?</font>

835
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:45,552
<font color="yellow">Send them back. Listen to what he says.</font>

836
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,382
<font color="yellow">Whose mum are you?</font>

837
00:51:47,652 --> 00:51:48,952
<font color="yellow">I'm Geum Sik's mum. What do you want?</font>

838
00:52:23,652 --> 00:52:24,782
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

839
00:52:25,752 --> 00:52:26,922
<font color="yellow">I'm going to pick up the girls.</font>

840
00:52:27,482 --> 00:52:29,222
<font color="yellow">I thought they were sleeping over.</font>

841
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:43,582
<font color="yellow">I'm coming home.</font>

842
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:46,382
<font color="yellow">Don't yell at me!</font>

843
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:47,952
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry, too.</font>

844
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:52,152
<font color="yellow">I met up with Do Geum. I'm coming home now.</font>

845
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:54,322
<font color="yellow">Yes. Sure.</font>

846
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:02,352
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

847
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,752
<font color="yellow">I'm by the street.</font>

848
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,222
<font color="yellow">I'll come up so please send them this way.</font>

849
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:08,952
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

850
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:18,922
<font color="yellow">- Geum Sik. - Yes. Where are the girls?</font>

851
00:53:19,222 --> 00:53:21,782
<font color="yellow">- Come in for a bit. - It's all right.</font>

852
00:53:21,952 --> 00:53:23,382
<font color="yellow">I'll stay here. You can call them.</font>

853
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:25,252
<font color="yellow">Come in for a bit.</font>

854
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:27,522
<font color="yellow">It's not like you can't.</font>

855
00:53:27,952 --> 00:53:30,722
<font color="yellow">You're not together any more but what about the girls?</font>

856
00:53:30,952 --> 00:53:33,122
<font color="yellow">Don't be so cold-hearted.</font>

857
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:36,622
<font color="yellow">Have a cup of tea and go.</font>

858
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:38,852
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

859
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,222
<font color="yellow">It makes me happy to see the four of you...</font>

860
00:53:57,482 --> 00:53:58,882
<font color="yellow">lying down like this.</font>

861
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:04,222
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy, Dad.</font>

862
00:54:04,952 --> 00:54:06,052
<font color="yellow">Are you?</font>

863
00:54:06,782 --> 00:54:08,782
<font color="yellow">Mum, I want us to live together like this.</font>

864
00:54:09,552 --> 00:54:10,652
<font color="yellow">Aren't you happy, Mum?</font>

865
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:12,482
<font color="yellow">It depends on how your dad behaves.</font>

866
00:54:12,552 --> 00:54:13,622
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to say.</font>

867
00:54:13,622 --> 00:54:15,782
<font color="yellow">- Mum and Dad, you should kiss. - What?</font>

868
00:54:15,782 --> 00:54:17,082
<font color="yellow">Let's close our eyes.</font>

869
00:54:17,652 --> 00:54:20,552
<font color="yellow">- Kiss! Kiss! - Kiss! Kiss!</font>

870
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:22,222
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

871
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:23,782
<font color="yellow">You can if you want.</font>

872
00:54:24,382 --> 00:54:25,452
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

873
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:27,252
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can't?</font>

874
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:01,522
<font color="yellow">You're more drawn to the woman you had children with.</font>

875
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,482
<font color="yellow">His ex-wife met the kids in secret...</font>

876
00:55:04,482 --> 00:55:05,652
<font color="yellow">and now, they're getting back together.</font>

877
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:12,282
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

878
00:55:13,422 --> 00:55:14,522
<font color="yellow">You're home, Cho Rong.</font>

879
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:15,922
<font color="yellow">You must be tired. It's late.</font>

880
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,152
<font color="yellow">You told him not to let us sleep with our mum, right?</font>

881
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,422
<font color="yellow">- Jo Cho Rong! - Don't do that.</font>

882
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,552
<font color="yellow">Come and eat.</font>

883
00:55:29,252 --> 00:55:31,952
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you. I have a morning meeting.</font>

884
00:55:32,222 --> 00:55:33,852
<font color="yellow">Really? You should get going.</font>

885
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:34,952
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

886
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:38,682
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Dad. - Bye, Dad.</font>

887
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:43,352
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your food.</font>

888
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:48,782
<font color="yellow">Here's sausage for Cho Rong.</font>

889
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:50,682
<font color="yellow">Here's ham for Da Rong.</font>

890
00:55:51,452 --> 00:55:53,552
<font color="yellow">You know the food we brought from our mum's house yesterday?</font>

891
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:54,682
<font color="yellow">I want them.</font>

892
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:56,122
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

893
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:02,922
<font color="yellow">It's cooked beans and stir-fried anchovies.</font>

894
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:04,552
<font color="yellow">I thought you don't eat them.</font>

895
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:06,182
<font color="yellow">I eat them if my grandma makes them.</font>

896
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:08,282
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

897
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:11,122
<font color="yellow">They're good for you so you should eat them.</font>

898
00:56:13,022 --> 00:56:16,582
<font color="yellow">Da Rong is having a concert at her kindergarten, right?</font>

899
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:18,222
<font color="yellow">Can I come?</font>

900
00:56:18,222 --> 00:56:19,582
<font color="yellow">Mum's coming.</font>

901
00:56:19,822 --> 00:56:21,552
<font color="yellow">My mum is much prettier.</font>

902
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:34,222
<font color="yellow">- It's delicious, right? - Yes, Cho Rong.</font>

903
00:56:35,122 --> 00:56:36,422
<font color="yellow">Can I try it?</font>

904
00:56:36,422 --> 00:56:38,522
<font color="yellow">No, don't eat it. It's ours.</font>

905
00:56:51,782 --> 00:56:53,052
<font color="yellow">Don't go off on your own.</font>

906
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:55,122
<font color="yellow">I'll drop you off by the bus.</font>

907
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:02,552
<font color="yellow">Mum, I want to go to her kindergarten, too.</font>

908
00:57:02,622 --> 00:57:04,922
<font color="yellow">They don't have a spot for you, yet. You have to wait a bit longer.</font>

909
00:57:05,382 --> 00:57:06,382
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

910
00:57:08,682 --> 00:57:09,682
<font color="yellow">Da Rong.</font>

911
00:57:17,152 --> 00:57:18,622
<font color="yellow">Let's take a seat.</font>

912
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:26,322
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Goodbye.</font>

913
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:43,382
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, good morning.</font>

914
00:57:43,552 --> 00:57:45,352
<font color="yellow">- Good morning. - Good morning.</font>

915
00:57:45,752 --> 00:57:46,752
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, go ahead.</font>

916
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:04,822
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

917
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,582
<font color="yellow">Don't lose your cool.</font>

918
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,682
<font color="yellow">Kid. You look smart.</font>

919
00:58:20,282 --> 00:58:21,282
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

920
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:22,752
<font color="yellow">You look charming.</font>

921
00:58:23,222 --> 00:58:24,752
<font color="yellow">About your mum,</font>

922
00:58:26,322 --> 00:58:29,952
<font color="yellow">she was pretty, kind and rich.</font>
