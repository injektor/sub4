<font color="yellow">It has a nail on it.</font>

<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon. Stand up.</font>

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,900

<font color="yellow">You...</font>

00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,370
<font color="yellow">Dad. No. You'll kill him.</font>

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,400
<font color="yellow">Today will be his last day as well as mine.</font>

<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,530
<font color="yellow">Dad. I'm sorry.</font>

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,230
<font color="yellow">Mum. I'm sorry.</font>

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,000
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol didn't do anything wrong.</font>

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,630
<font color="yellow">I asked him to live with me.</font>

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,130
<font color="yellow">You must be out of your mind.</font>

21

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,530
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,130
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,430
<font color="yellow">Please don't be angry with Gab Soon.</font>

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,530
<font color="yellow">Hit me instead. Gab Soon is...</font>

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,130
<font color="yellow">I said don't.</font>

27
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,700
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,130

<font color="yellow">Gab Soon's pregnant, Mum.</font>

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,360
<font color="yellow">The dream was about a baby.</font>

32
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,460
<font color="yellow">You had a dream.</font>

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,400
<font color="yellow">A dragon flying up to the sky and falling into Gab Soon's arms.</font>

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,460
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me?</font>

35
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,300
<font color="yellow">- How could you do this? - Mum.</font>

36

<font color="yellow">How could you do this?</font>

42
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,760
<font color="yellow">If you got a girl pregnant,</font>

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,100
<font color="yellow">you should have got approval from both parents.</font>

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,200
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's manly?</font>

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,130
<font color="yellow">Do you still think you're a man?</font>

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,330
<font color="yellow">You're not even human.</font>

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,130
<font color="yellow">Do you know what Gab Soon means to us?</font>

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,230
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

50
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,360
<font color="yellow">I know I was wrong.</font>

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,930
<font color="yellow">She stayed with me for 10 years though I'm penniless.</font>

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,130
<font color="yellow">I wanted both our parents to approve...</font>

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,830
<font color="yellow">and have a blessed wedding in front of everyone.</font>

54
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,260
<font color="yellow">I also want us to have a beautiful wedding, a beautiful house...</font>

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,000
<font color="yellow">and raise a beautiful baby.</font>

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,930
<font color="yellow">But you know why I can't.</font>

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,100
<font color="yellow">I haven't even gotten a job yet.</font>

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,800
<font color="yellow">I don't know when I'll pass the exam.</font>

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,960
<font color="yellow">I can't even rent a room on my own. How can we have a wedding?</font>

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,500
<font color="yellow">To get married in this country, men should provide the house.</font>

61
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,860
<font color="yellow">I don't even have 10 dollars in my pocket.</font>

62
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,630
<font color="yellow">I can't afford to get a place. It costs over 100,000 dollars.</font>

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,730
<font color="yellow">We can't have a wedding.</font>

64
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,860
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon and I are not...</font>

65
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,400
<font color="yellow">from a family who can support us financially.</font>

66
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,330
<font color="yellow">This was...</font>

67
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,460
<font color="yellow">the best I could do.</font>

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

69
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,860
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
<font color="yellow">You're crazy.</font>

71
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,800
<font color="yellow">You're a terrible person.</font>

72
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,900
<font color="yellow">Do you like him that much?</font>

73
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,800
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

74
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,830
<font color="yellow">Your life is ruined.</font>

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,300
<font color="yellow">Mum. Let's sit down and talk.</font>

76
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,460
<font color="yellow">She's with child.</font>

77
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,930
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear that.</font>

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,730
<font color="yellow">She's not even married yet.</font>

79
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,360
<font color="yellow">- Get her some water. - Water? Okay.</font>

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,100
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,460
<font color="yellow">Mum, drink some water.</font>

82
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,460
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now?</font>

83
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,560
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,260
<font color="yellow">Forgive me, Dad.</font>

85
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,560
<font color="yellow">You should've listened to me sooner.</font>

86
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,360
<font color="yellow">- I knew you'd be wailing someday. - Aunt.</font>

87
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,260
<font color="yellow">Say something.</font>

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,030
<font color="yellow">I feel so lonely.</font>

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,100
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed in you.</font>

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,030
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear that. Come up with a solution.</font>

91
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,730
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

92
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,160
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

93
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,430
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

94
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,630
<font color="yellow">Dear me.</font>

95
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,960
<font color="yellow">You're 29 years old already. Was that the best you could do?</font>

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,300
<font color="yellow">I didn't raise you to be like this.</font>

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,530
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

98
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,300
<font color="yellow">You know how much we adored you because you're the youngest.</font>

99
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,730
<font color="yellow">What do you know? You broke our hearts.</font>

100
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,160
<font color="yellow">How could you let us down like this?</font>

101
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,630
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm sorry.</font>

102
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,430
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You crazy girl.</font>

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,000
<font color="yellow">Don't take it so seriously.</font>

104
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,900
<font color="yellow">These days, people often live together before marriage.</font>

105
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,060
<font color="yellow">No, they don't.</font>

106
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,800
<font color="yellow">If they could look after themselves,</font>

107
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,030
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't care if they live together or not.</font>

108
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,130
<font color="yellow">They're both still jobless.</font>

109
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,700
<font color="yellow">They just got a place to stay together.</font>

110
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,100
<font color="yellow">Nobody can accept that.</font>

111
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,230
<font color="yellow">That's not important. What's important is their happiness.</font>

112
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,560
<font color="yellow">Now that...</font>

113
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,360
<font color="yellow">you know she's pregnant, how about letting them get married?</font>

114
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,630
<font color="yellow">I can't let her marry that jerk.</font>

115
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,030
<font color="yellow">What else can we do? She's pregnant.</font>

116
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,130
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be him of all people?</font>

117
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,360
<font color="yellow">It's because they're alike.</font>

118
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
<font color="yellow">You should've thought about the consequences.</font>

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,730
<font color="yellow">He's a slacker who can't even get a job. Why would you...</font>

120
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,930
<font color="yellow">have his baby?</font>

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop seeing him.</font>

122
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,200
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

123
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,730
<font color="yellow">This can ruin your life.</font>

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,000
<font color="yellow">Don't be too hard on her.</font>

125
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she didn't want this, either.</font>

126
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,060
<font color="yellow">It must've just happened.</font>

127
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,600
<font color="yellow">Tell me. What's your plan?</font>

128
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,360
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have the baby.</font>

129
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,400
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

130
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,400
<font color="yellow">I'll hear the wailing soon.</font>

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,730
<font color="yellow">What will you do after that?</font>

132
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,360
<font color="yellow">Are you going to raise it alone?</font>

133
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,500
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

134
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,800
<font color="yellow">Even if it's all my fault and my mistake,</font>

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,300
<font color="yellow">I'm already with child. What do you expect me to do?</font>

136
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,260
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry to you and Dad, but there is nothing I can do.</font>

137
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,200
<font color="yellow">She's starting to become a living proof.</font>

138
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

139
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,230
<font color="yellow">When did you know about this?</font>

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,200
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you do anything?</font>

141
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,330
<font color="yellow">You're her brother and sister.</font>

142
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,260
<font color="yellow">You're going to have the baby?</font>

143
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
<font color="yellow">If you do, how are you going to raise it?</font>

144
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,060
<font color="yellow">Do you think raising a baby is easy?</font>

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,400
<font color="yellow">He said he will pass the exam no matter what.</font>

146
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,500
<font color="yellow">Pass? Him?</font>

147
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,930
<font color="yellow">Wake up. He hasn't been able to pass for the last 10 years.</font>

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,260
<font color="yellow">I'll get a job.</font>

149
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,600
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you'll get a job, make money,</font>

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,230
<font color="yellow">support his study...</font>

151
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,600
<font color="yellow">and raise his baby?</font>

152
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,200
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

153
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,500
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Nae Shim.</font>

154
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,060
<font color="yellow">We worked so hard to support you through university.</font>

155
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,400
<font color="yellow">Then you tell me you'll have that jerk's baby...</font>

156
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,560
<font color="yellow">and support his study.</font>

157
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
<font color="yellow">It's all her fate.</font>

158
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,930
<font color="yellow">She brought this on herself.</font>

159
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,700
<font color="yellow">Just go out and die.</font>

160
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,370
<font color="yellow">Get out of my sight!</font>

161
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,630
<font color="yellow">You never know. She might win a lottery or something.</font>

162
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,630
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

163
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,500
<font color="yellow">Do you have to cause trouble to our family all the time?</font>

164
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,230
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting angry at me?</font>

165
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,400
<font color="yellow">This happened because of you.</font>

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,330
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon. Did you hear that?</font>

167
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,030
<font color="yellow">Gosh. She can't be serious.</font>

168
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,400
<font color="yellow">Why is she blaming me for her daughter's mistake?</font>

169
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,700
<font color="yellow">Would you expect me to do nothing about...</font>

170
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,960
<font color="yellow">her living with her boyfriend without her parents knowing?</font>

171
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,160
<font color="yellow">Frankly, you even had a dream about her having a baby.</font>

172
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,730
<font color="yellow">You saw a dragon going up to the sky and falling into Gab Soon's arms.</font>

173
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,400
<font color="yellow">I can't take this any more.</font>

174
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

175
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,830
<font color="yellow">Call him. Tell him to come over.</font>

176
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,930
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Mum.</font>

177
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,560
<font color="yellow">You beat him up already.</font>

178
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,730
<font color="yellow">It's both Gab Soon and Gab Dol's fault.</font>

179
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,060
<font color="yellow">I can't let it pass like this. Let's go.</font>

180
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,560
<font color="yellow">I need to see his mother who raised him...</font>

181
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,730
<font color="yellow">so poorly.</font>

182
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,960
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

183
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,060
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to her, too.</font>

184
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,900
<font color="yellow">Lead the way.</font>

185
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,060
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

186
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,130
<font color="yellow">Lead the way.</font>

187
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,230
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

188
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,700
<font color="yellow">Are we there yet?</font>

189
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,460
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

190
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,370
<font color="yellow">It's too far. You said it's only five minutes away.</font>

191
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,630
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

192
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,560
<font color="yellow">You're just going around.</font>

193
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,460
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'll take care of this.</font>

194
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,800
<font color="yellow">This won't do you any good.</font>

195
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,300
<font color="yellow">I have things to say. Where is it?</font>

196
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

197
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,630
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

198
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,130
<font color="yellow">Is anybody home?</font>

199
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,030
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

200
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,530
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,030
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

202
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,800
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

203
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,460
<font color="yellow">It's between adults.</font>

204
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

205
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.</font>

206
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,260
<font color="yellow">Is this where Gab Dol lives?</font>

207
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,300
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

208
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,100
<font color="yellow">You raised such a pathetic son.</font>

209
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,260
<font color="yellow">Who are you people?</font>

210
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

211
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,900
<font color="yellow">You know Gab Soon, right?</font>

212
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,560
<font color="yellow">I'm her father.</font>

213
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,100
<font color="yellow">I'm her mother.</font>

214
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

215
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,030
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol isn't home.</font>

216
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,000
<font color="yellow">Can we have this conversation inside?</font>

217
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
<font color="yellow">Hold... Hold on.</font>

218
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,730
<font color="yellow">I'm at a loss for words.</font>

219
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,460
<font color="yellow">You're saying...</font>

220
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,730
<font color="yellow">your daughter got pregnant with Gab Dol's baby,</font>

221
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,360
<font color="yellow">and they've been even living together.</font>

222
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,000
<font color="yellow">You think it's his fault and he should be responsible. Is that it?</font>

223
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,500
<font color="yellow">That's not my son's fault.</font>

224
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,860
<font color="yellow">Whose fault is it, then?</font>

225
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,200
<font color="yellow">She's almost 30 now. She should take care of her own body.</font>

226
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,000
<font color="yellow">Are you saying it's her fault that she got pregnant?</font>

227
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,100
<font color="yellow">Don't talk like that.</font>

228
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,860
<font color="yellow">She's being rude.</font>

229
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,460
<font color="yellow">- What are you going to do? - What?</font>

230
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,230
<font color="yellow">Your son ruined my daughter's life. You should take your responsibility.</font>

231
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,030
<font color="yellow">You have to at least compensate for the damages.</font>

232
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,260
<font color="yellow">Damages?</font>

233
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you came here for,</font>

234
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,130
<font color="yellow">but I didn't like your daughter in the first place.</font>

235
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,030
<font color="yellow">She's not pretty or smart. She doesn't even have a job.</font>

236
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,130
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this woman.</font>

237
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,200
<font color="yellow">How about your son? Is your son so great?</font>

238
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,630
<font color="yellow">Even if he isn't,</font>

239
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,860
<font color="yellow">everyone knows that your daughter is the one chasing around my son.</font>

240
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,460
<font color="yellow">She's not good enough for Gab Dol.</font>

241
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,130
<font color="yellow">She's the one who helped you when Gab Dol was in the army.</font>

242
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,000
<font color="yellow">You called her in to do your laundry and cook for you.</font>

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,630
<font color="yellow">You treated her like a maid. You can't say she's not good enough.</font>

244
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,100
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for your daughter, Gab Dol would've passed already,</font>

245
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,200
<font color="yellow">had a teacher wife, enjoying his happy life.</font>

246
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,500
<font color="yellow">Your daughter seduced my innocent son.</font>

247
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,500
<font color="yellow">Look at you talk.</font>

248
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,730
<font color="yellow">You should be thankful my daughter even stayed with your foolish son.</font>

249
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,500
<font color="yellow">Who seduced who?</font>

250
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,560
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon stayed with him because she's so naive.</font>

251
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,060
<font color="yellow">Go ask anyone.</font>

252
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
<font color="yellow">Nobody would go out with a jobless guy.</font>

253
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,260
<font color="yellow">Why? I need to say the truth.</font>

254
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,200
<font color="yellow">Now that you're old and don't have anything,</font>

255
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,000
<font color="yellow">you must have planned to make a fortune through you daughter.</font>

256
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,400
<font color="yellow">Dream on.</font>

257
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,700
<font color="yellow">Who are you to blame? She should have taken care of her body herself.</font>

258
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,130
<font color="yellow">Watch your tongue.</font>

259
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,100
<font color="yellow">- Calm down. - What are you saying?</font>

260
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,530
<font color="yellow">You heard her.</font>

261
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,000
<font color="yellow">Keep still.</font>

262
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,130
<font color="yellow">You keep on blaming my daughter.</font>

263
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,560
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that's too harsh?</font>

264
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,800
<font color="yellow">It's 2 against 1.</font>

265
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,230
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

266
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,460
<font color="yellow">I was wondering who your son took after. It must be you.</font>

267
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,830
<font color="yellow">You have no common sense. You ignorant woman.</font>

268
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,760
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm an ignorant woman. So what?</font>

269
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,330
<font color="yellow">Who do you think you are?</font>

270
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,630
<font color="yellow">Are you looking down on me because I'm living on my own?</font>

271
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,960
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that?</font>

272
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you look down on me because I don't have a husband.</font>

273
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I have anyone else?</font>

274
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,730
<font color="yellow">Call anyone. Whoever you want.</font>

275
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,530
<font color="yellow">(My son)</font>

276
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,530
<font color="yellow">This phone is turned off. You will be directed to voice mail.</font>

277
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,900
<font color="yellow">(My daughter)</font>

278
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,660
<font color="yellow">If nobody's watching,</font>

279
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,800
<font color="yellow">you'll blame us for hitting you.</font>

280
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,160
<font color="yellow">Come home quick.</font>

281
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,130
<font color="yellow">I can't hear you. Speak louder.</font>

282
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,730
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

283
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,730
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be there soon.</font>

284
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

285
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,300
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

286
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,000
<font color="yellow">Do what?</font>

287
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,330
<font color="yellow">Don't you make my son do anything. I won't let that.</font>

288
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,860
<font color="yellow">He needs to take responsibility.</font>

289
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
<font color="yellow">Why should we?</font>

290
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,230
<font color="yellow">Who knows whose baby it is?</font>

291
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,300
<font color="yellow">Did you check if it's my son's baby?</font>

292
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you saying?</font>

293
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,100
<font color="yellow">Watch your tongue.</font>

294
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,430
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

295
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,130
<font color="yellow">Get up. Talking like this is useless.</font>

296
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,030
<font color="yellow">Same here.</font>

297
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,460
<font color="yellow">Do you think I wanted to come here?</font>

298
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,160
<font color="yellow">I hate your son too.</font>

299
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,930
<font color="yellow">Like mother like son.</font>

300
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,460
<font color="yellow">That woman. I should have grabbed her by her hair.</font>

301
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,930
<font color="yellow">Being a mother of a daughter makes you powerless.</font>

302
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,400
<font color="yellow">I was worried what will happen to my daughter carrying a baby.</font>

303
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,000
<font color="yellow">It annoys me I couldn't say everything I wanted to say.</font>

304
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,160
<font color="yellow">You should have come quick to back her up.</font>

305
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,300
<font color="yellow">I couldn't help out.</font>

306
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,930
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

307
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,800
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

308
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,360
<font color="yellow">How could they look down on my mum?</font>

309
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,200
<font color="yellow">I won't let this slide.</font>

310
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

311
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,030
<font color="yellow">I'm annoyed that you had to take that.</font>

312
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,830
<font color="yellow">Why did Dad pass away so soon?</font>

313
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,500
<font color="yellow">If you feel annoyed about this, get a hold of yourself.</font>

314
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,760
<font color="yellow">Think how things would have been if Geum Sik was still with you.</font>

315
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,860
<font color="yellow">How reassuring would that have been?</font>

316
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,700
<font color="yellow">This phone is turned off. You'll be directed to voice mail.</font>

317
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,760
<font color="yellow">Please speak after the beep.</font>

318
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

319
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,260
<font color="yellow">Turn you phone on right now.</font>

320
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,730
<font color="yellow">How can you go out drinking after making all this fuss?</font>

321
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,070
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

322
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,930
<font color="yellow">Mum had to take it on her own.</font>

323
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,900
<font color="yellow">They came in a group.</font>

324
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,930
<font color="yellow">You were out drinking?</font>

325
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,730
<font color="yellow">Just keep out of this.</font>

326
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,030
<font color="yellow">Is she pregnant?</font>

327
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,330
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm sorry.</font>

328
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
<font color="yellow">I did wrong.</font>

329
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,000
<font color="yellow">You're sorry?</font>

330
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,000
<font color="yellow">Do you know Mum's going through all this for you?</font>

331
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,500
<font color="yellow">Mum's knee...</font>

332
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,930
<font color="yellow">What do you call the bone again?</font>

333
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,570
<font color="yellow">You worked at the restaurant.</font>

334
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,400
<font color="yellow">- Knee cartilage? - Yes, knee cartilage.</font>

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,930
<font color="yellow">She wakes up at 3am and walks up the hilly area to deliver milk.</font>

336
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,860
<font color="yellow">She goes to tend to the old man in the afternoon.</font>

337
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,100
<font color="yellow">At night, she can't sleep because her body aches all over.</font>

338
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,700
<font color="yellow">Then at 3am she wakes up again and delivers milk.</font>

339
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,570
<font color="yellow">In the afternoon, she goes to care for the old man.</font>

340
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,960
<font color="yellow">Then lie down with her aching body.</font>

341
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,530
<font color="yellow">Then at 3am she wakes up and...</font>

342
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,760
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

343
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,200
<font color="yellow">No need to repeat it three times.</font>

344
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,860
<font color="yellow">Think how disappointed Mum would be.</font>

345
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,900
<font color="yellow">You pull yourself together first.</font>

346
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,160
<font color="yellow">The fish always stinks from the head downwards.</font>

347
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,630
<font color="yellow">What would he have learned from you?</font>

348
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,900
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you. Get out.</font>

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,570
<font color="yellow">- She wants you to get out. - You too.</font>

350
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,330
<font color="yellow">Aren't I right?</font>

351
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,100
<font color="yellow">Look at his eyes. It looks dull.</font>

352
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,570
<font color="yellow">That's why every time he said he's going out to study,</font>

353
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,730
<font color="yellow">it sounded like he's going out to live together.</font>

354
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,600
<font color="yellow">- Soo Jo. - Yes?</font>

355
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,000
<font color="yellow">You're nothing like them.</font>

356
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,930
<font color="yellow">Don't you get close with him. You'll walk a different path.</font>

357
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

358
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,200
<font color="yellow">What if this affects us?</font>

359
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,230
<font color="yellow">That reminds me.</font>

360
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,900
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

361
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
<font color="yellow">Hold it in.</font>

362
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,160
<font color="yellow">You need to eat something and take your medicine.</font>

363
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,430
<font color="yellow">Don't get stressed.</font>

364
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,660
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

365
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,730
<font color="yellow">She's making porridge for Joong Nyeon.</font>

366
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,860
<font color="yellow">She's making a lot of porridge these days.</font>

367
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,070
<font color="yellow">You look terrible.</font>

368
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,700
<font color="yellow">You've aged overnight.</font>

369
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,860
<font color="yellow">Now you're like my brother.</font>

370
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,160
<font color="yellow">Watch your tongue today. Don't get on my nerve.</font>

371
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,630
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

372
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,400
<font color="yellow">Get dressed.</font>

373
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,030
<font color="yellow">Get ready. Before she gets angry.</font>

374
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,630
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - I told you to come out.</font>

375
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,730
<font color="yellow">No. I won't.</font>

376
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,600
<font color="yellow">Let me do this.</font>

377
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,300
<font color="yellow">I'll manage on my own. I won't let you worry.</font>

378
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,260
<font color="yellow">I'll do it on my own.</font>

379
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,260
<font color="yellow">She'll take care of her life.</font>

380
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,700
<font color="yellow">I told you to come out.</font>

381
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,630
<font color="yellow">Listen to your mum.</font>

382
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,360
<font color="yellow">You can't raise a kid on your own.</font>

383
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,760
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

384
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,900
<font color="yellow">Mum. Just this once.</font>

385
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,130
<font color="yellow">Just this once. I'll do it my way.</font>

386
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,500
<font color="yellow">I'll do it my way.</font>

387
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,930
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

388
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,160
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

389
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,130
<font color="yellow">You can't solve it like this.</font>

390
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,860
<font color="yellow">- Let go. - Mum.</font>

391
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,630
<font color="yellow">The hospital won't even do it. It's illegal.</font>

392
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,900
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

393
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,300
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we do something before it shows?</font>

394
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,660
<font color="yellow">Are you going to watch her raise the baby on her own?</font>

395
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,300
<font color="yellow">Mum. I'm sorry.</font>

396
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,360
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Mum.</font>

397
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,460
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

398
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,600
<font color="yellow">I emptied the room.</font>

399
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,260
<font color="yellow">It must've been tough for the past few days.</font>

400
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,660
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon is going through more.</font>

401
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,070
<font color="yellow">What can we do?</font>

402
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,000
<font color="yellow">It was only natural that both parents were enraged.</font>

403
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

404
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,960
<font color="yellow">Wait just a bit more.</font>

405
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,960
<font color="yellow">We need to persuade them and let you get married.</font>

406
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,030
<font color="yellow">You need to make a move today.</font>

407
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,700
<font color="yellow">- I know. - Easter egg.</font>

408
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,360
<font color="yellow">Throw the net.</font>

409
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,430
<font color="yellow">Then reel it in.</font>

410
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,430
<font color="yellow">Wait and see.</font>

411
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,630
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

412
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,060
<font color="yellow">You look sad.</font>

413
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,960
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

414
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,130
<font color="yellow">What will you have, Sir?</font>

415
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,400
<font color="yellow">Go away. I don't have an appetite today.</font>

416
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,530
<font color="yellow">We have high-quality beef that...</font>

417
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,560
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear me?</font>

418
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,330
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't skip a meal, Sir.</font>

419
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
<font color="yellow">She must be hungry.</font>

420
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,300
<font color="yellow">This is all the change I have.</font>

421
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,430
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ma'am.</font>

422
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,430
<font color="yellow">Let's share your problem.</font>

423
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,160
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to go through with it alone.</font>

424
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,230
<font color="yellow">My father wouldn't budge.</font>

425
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,860
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

426
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,530
<font color="yellow">It's my marriage. I told you before, right?</font>

427
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,600
<font color="yellow">Everyone in my family marries young.</font>

428
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,460
<font color="yellow">He wants me to go on a blind date this weekend.</font>

429
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
<font color="yellow">A blind date?</font>

430
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,800
<font color="yellow">Do you have to marry that person?</font>

431
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,030
<font color="yellow">Our family has been close.</font>

432
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,830
<font color="yellow">She's 23 years old. She attends Harvard University.</font>

433
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
<font color="yellow">I heard she entered some beauty pageant.</font>

434
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,900
<font color="yellow">It's giving me a headache.</font>

435
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,000
<font color="yellow">I should go home early today.</font>

436
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,200
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

437
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,430
<font color="yellow">I want to take you somewhere.</font>

438
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,660
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

439
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,560
<font color="yellow">Pick one.</font>

440
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,400
<font color="yellow">I want to give you a present.</font>

441
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,500
<font color="yellow">You pulled me in here for this? I hate it.</font>

442
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry if I offended you.</font>

443
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,530
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to give you something.</font>

444
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,700
<font color="yellow">I have many of these at home,</font>

445
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,560
<font color="yellow">but I just don't bother to wear them.</font>

446
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,430
<font color="yellow">I know you have them piled up in the storage.</font>

447
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,800
<font color="yellow">It will lighten up your mood.</font>

448
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,500
<font color="yellow">Just let me buy you one for fun.</font>

449
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,230
<font color="yellow">This one looks good.</font>

450
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,730
<font color="yellow">- Try it. - Hey.</font>

451
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,130
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

452
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,260
<font color="yellow">Father. I won't go on a blind date.</font>

453
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,760
<font color="yellow">Don't accept things in a haste.</font>

454
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,430
<font color="yellow">It will make you look dumb.</font>

455
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,560
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

456
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,930
<font color="yellow">Hey. Soo Jo!</font>

457
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,860
<font color="yellow">Thank you, but I can't accept this.</font>

458
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,030
<font color="yellow">My father wants to see me. I'll call you.</font>

459
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,860
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

460
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,430
<font color="yellow">I can't get him even with a luxury watch.</font>

461
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,300
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

462
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,300
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon. Are you feeling well?</font>

463
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,630
<font color="yellow">Don't skip meals. You should eat.</font>

464
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,800
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

465
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,230
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

466
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,100
<font color="yellow">Let's get through this together. I miss you, too.</font>

467
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,330
<font color="yellow">He's sitting in front of a book, but it doesn't look like he's studying.</font>

468
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,960
<font color="yellow">Don't let him go outside.</font>

469
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,900
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

470
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? It's your working hour.</font>

471
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,130
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

472
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,160
<font color="yellow">It's time for my meal.</font>

473
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,000
<font color="yellow">Man trouble?</font>

474
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,300
<font color="yellow">He's a man, but not that kind of a man.</font>

475
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,100
<font color="yellow">Watch out for the men who know you're alone.</font>

476
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,430
<font color="yellow">You should behave yourself so they won't look down on you.</font>

477
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,600
<font color="yellow">Don't just grab any men.</font>

478
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,730
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

479
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sad enough that I'm all alone. You don't have to make it worse.</font>

480
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,730
<font color="yellow">Don't look down on me because I'm alone.</font>

481
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,430
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? Relief Patch!</font>

482
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,860
<font color="yellow">He's asleep.</font>

483
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,360
<font color="yellow">(He's asleep.)</font>

484
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,760
<font color="yellow">That's mine.</font>

485
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,630
<font color="yellow">- Why are you crying? - He hit me.</font>

486
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,930
<font color="yellow">Why did you hit her? You shouldn't hit people.</font>

487
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,160
<font color="yellow">I didn't hit her.</font>

488
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,760
<font color="yellow">She threw my toy.</font>

489
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,430
<font color="yellow">It's not yours.</font>

490
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,030
<font color="yellow">My dad bought you that.</font>

491
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,330
<font color="yellow">You still shouldn't have hit her. Are you a bully?</font>

492
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,660
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

493
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,430
<font color="yellow">What are you crying about?</font>

494
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,100
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't like being hit, either.</font>

495
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,400
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. I can't sleep.</font>

496
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,000
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Can't you hear them fighting?</font>

497
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,560
<font color="yellow">After he moved in, it's always so noisy.</font>

498
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,800
<font color="yellow">I need to get some sleep before my flight.</font>

499
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,760
<font color="yellow">You don't know how hard working is, right?</font>

500
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,960
<font color="yellow">A housewife wouldn't know.</font>

501
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

502
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,500
<font color="yellow">Teach him a lesson.</font>

503
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
<font color="yellow">He shouldn't use violence.</font>

504
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,700
<font color="yellow">You should be good to her.</font>

505
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,400
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't hit her.</font>

506
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,360
<font color="yellow">Go to your room.</font>

507
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,500
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Da Rong?</font>

508
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,600
<font color="yellow">- I'll scold Ddol Ee later. - Okay.</font>

509
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,600
<font color="yellow">They're poor kids without a mother.</font>

510
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,000
<font color="yellow">He must be acting cheeky because he has you. You should manage him.</font>

511
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,860
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

512
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,230
<font color="yellow">He wants us to come in.</font>

513
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,660
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

514
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,800
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

515
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

516
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
<font color="yellow">She's pregnant.</font>

517
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,530
<font color="yellow">I know he's not good enough, but we should get them married.</font>

518
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,400
<font color="yellow">I can't let Gab Soon live with his family.</font>

519
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,760
<font color="yellow">How can I let her marry him when I know he's incompetent?</font>

520
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,000
<font color="yellow">He's almost 30, but he's a slacker without a job.</font>

521
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,800
<font color="yellow">I know Gab Soon will have to work hard to support him.</font>

522
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,700
<font color="yellow">Besides, you saw how his mother talks about Gab Soon.</font>

523
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,030
<font color="yellow">It's just her fate.</font>

524
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,530
<font color="yellow">Does she have to marry him just because he's the father?</font>

525
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,460
<font color="yellow">Don't just think about the present. Think about the future.</font>

526
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,530
<font color="yellow">You said you can never have her raising her child by herself.</font>

527
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,230
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even bear to see...</font>

528
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,660
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon raising Ddol Ee alone, so you got her married again.</font>

529
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,100
<font color="yellow">It's different for Gab Soon.</font>

530
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,600
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon didn't go through much trouble growing up. She's soft.</font>

531
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,200
<font color="yellow">But Gab Soon is strong. She will survive anything.</font>

532
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,030
<font color="yellow">She's strong. It's true.</font>

533
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,200
<font color="yellow">She's so strong that she did something others won't do.</font>

534
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,660
<font color="yellow">Still, it's better to have an incompetent husband...</font>

535
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,200
<font color="yellow">than raising a baby on her own.</font>

536
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,400
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

537
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,030
<font color="yellow">It's better to have a husband.</font>

538
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,260
<font color="yellow">I expected so much from her.</font>

539
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,160
<font color="yellow">That wretch.</font>

540
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,500
<font color="yellow">She was so smart when she was a student.</font>

541
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,300
<font color="yellow">How could she ruin her life so easily like this?</font>

542
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,960
<font color="yellow">That's how life is.</font>

543
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,800
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol isn't a bad guy.</font>

544
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,030
<font color="yellow">Call Gab Dol's mother and let me talk to her.</font>

545
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,560
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

546
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,830
<font color="yellow">You already said what you had to say.</font>

547
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,730
<font color="yellow">I have something important to talk to you about.</font>

548
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,260
<font color="yellow">I'll wait until you get off work.</font>

549
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,230
<font color="yellow">I'll see you there.</font>

550
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,400
<font color="yellow">You don't have to grovel to her.</font>

551
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,430
<font color="yellow">You two already said what you wanted to say.</font>

552
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that night.</font>

553
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,200
<font color="yellow">It took me by surprise.</font>

554
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,960
<font color="yellow">I didn't realise that it was rude to barge in like that.</font>

555
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,100
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

556
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,830
<font color="yellow">That's right. Here.</font>

557
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,500
<font color="yellow">I visited your house empty-handed.</font>

558
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,700
<font color="yellow">I bought some chestnuts on my way here.</font>

559
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,660
<font color="yellow">They're delicious when steamed.</font>

560
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,730
<font color="yellow">I don't need it.</font>

561
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,730
<font color="yellow">If you wanted to apologise, your wife should be here, too.</font>

562
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,060
<font color="yellow">She's sick in bed right now.</font>

563
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,960
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, I'm sorry...</font>

564
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,430
<font color="yellow">for what my wife said. I'm sorry.</font>

565
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,800
<font color="yellow">What do you want to talk about?</font>

566
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,760
<font color="yellow">Would you like some tea first?</font>

567
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,900
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

568
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,260
<font color="yellow">- Well... - If it's about...</font>

569
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,660
<font color="yellow">marrying the kids, don't even start.</font>

570
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,030
<font color="yellow">She's already pregnant.</font>

571
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,800
<font color="yellow">I won't allow it even if they have a couple of babies together.</font>

572
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,430
<font color="yellow">What shall we do, then?</font>

573
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,160
<font color="yellow">If it's too much for you right now,</font>

574
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,160
<font color="yellow">we'll try our best...</font>

575
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,400
<font color="yellow">Are you planning to ruin my son's future?</font>

576
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,530
<font color="yellow">Let's not try to make things work. It's pointless.</font>

577
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,030
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for my daughter.</font>

578
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,400
<font color="yellow">She wants to have the baby.</font>

579
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,860
<font color="yellow">Your daughter is so stubborn.</font>

580
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,500
<font color="yellow">It's not like I didn't know.</font>

581
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,330
<font color="yellow">I guess she'll take care of herself.</font>

582
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,060
<font color="yellow">This is all I have to say.</font>

583
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,930
<font color="yellow">Please, take this.</font>

584
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,900
<font color="yellow">I don't need it.</font>

585
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,060
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother.</font>

586
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,430
<font color="yellow">Don't call me mother. I need to see you.</font>

587
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,930
<font color="yellow">I have a daughter myself...</font>

588
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,830
<font color="yellow">so I understand your parents' point of view.</font>

589
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,300
<font color="yellow">Their unmarried daughter is pregnant...</font>

590
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,200
<font color="yellow">so obviously they want to get her married.</font>

591
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,830
<font color="yellow">But this isn't how it's supposed to be.</font>

592
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,600
<font color="yellow">I told you this ahead of time.</font>

593
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,660
<font color="yellow">You two can't be together.</font>

594
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,330
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing this for myself.</font>

595
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,830
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this for my son and you.</font>

596
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,300
<font color="yellow">If you get married now, it'll be good for nothing.</font>

597
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,260
<font color="yellow">You'll get divorced within a year.</font>

598
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,970
<font color="yellow">Even if your parents come and beg, I won't bat an eye.</font>

599
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,500
<font color="yellow">You're going to have the baby?</font>

600
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,530
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. It's your baby so you can do whatever you want.</font>

601
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,030
<font color="yellow">I'll pay half of the child support.</font>

602
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,600
<font color="yellow">That's what the law says so I'll follow it.</font>

603
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,100
<font color="yellow">You have an ill-fated relationship with Gab Dol.</font>

604
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,200
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about continuing this relationship over the baby.</font>

605
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,360
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you ever again. You may go.</font>

606
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

607
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,830
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon! Gab Soon!</font>

608
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon!</font>

609
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,930
<font color="yellow">Hello! Is anybody there?</font>

610
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,230
<font color="yellow">Save Gab Soon!</font>

611
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
<font color="yellow">Bring her here.</font>

612
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,470
<font color="yellow">(Emergency Medical Centre)</font>

613
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,730
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon fainted.</font>

614
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,560
<font color="yellow">We're at Se Gye's hospital.</font>

615

<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

616
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,600
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon. Gab Soon!</font>

617
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,360
<font color="yellow">Move over. I'll do it.

<font color="yellow">- Oh, gosh. - Oh, dear.</font>

619
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,230
<font color="yellow">- What happened? - Is she alive?</font>

620
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,330
<font color="yellow">She's fine.</font>

621
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,900
<font color="yellow">I'll have her here for a day.</font>

622
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,470
<font color="yellow">It's malnutrition and shock.</font>

623
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,730
<font color="yellow">And... You see...</font>

624
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,970
<font color="yellow">She's not pregnant.</font>

625
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,470
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

626
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,470
<font color="yellow">She's not pregnant?</font>

627
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,470
<font color="yellow">It was a false pregnancy from excessive stress.</font>

628
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,030
<font color="yellow">It happened because she had fear of getting pregnant.</font>

629
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,900
<font color="yellow">Plus, her menstrual cycle was irregular due to stress...</font>

630
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
<font color="yellow">and she wasn't having a regular cycle for two months.</font>

631
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,430
<font color="yellow">Once she's treated for malnutrition and becomes stable, she'll be fine.</font>

632
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

633
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,900
<font color="yellow">Then was this all fake?</font>

634
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,030
<font color="yellow">What's the dream about the baby?</font>

635
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

636
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,260
<font color="yellow">You heard, right?</font>

637
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,730
<font color="yellow">I don't even know what we were doing.</font>

638
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,130
<font color="yellow">I saw two lines for sure.</font>

639
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,300
<font color="yellow">They say it happens sometimes.</font>

640
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,630
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do but laugh.</font>

641
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,700
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

642
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,700
<font color="yellow">How could this be?</font>

643
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,000
<font color="yellow">You know what I thought about while I was running with you on my back?</font>

644
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,930
<font color="yellow">What did you think about?</font>

645
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,430
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

646
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,200
<font color="yellow">I was heavy, right?</font>

647
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

648
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,730
<font color="yellow">You were light.</font>

649
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,530
<font color="yellow">You were so light...</font>

650
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,830
<font color="yellow">that it broke my heart.</font>

651
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,700
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

652
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,760
<font color="yellow">Let's make a promise.</font>

653
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,970
<font color="yellow">Do you know what it's going to be?</font>

654
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,700
<font color="yellow">"Get better soon, Gab Soon."</font>

655
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
<font color="yellow">"I'll pass this exam 3,000 percent."</font>

656
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,400
<font color="yellow">Let's start over again from the beginning.</font>

657
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,630
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

658
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,860
<font color="yellow">We're such a great match.</font>

659
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,800
<font color="yellow">When we have a baby in the future,</font>

660
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,260
<font color="yellow">let's make sure...</font>

661
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,530
<font color="yellow">we get everybody's blessing.</font>

662
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,000
<font color="yellow">You're going to get married?</font>

663
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,200
<font color="yellow">Are you still half asleep?</font>

664
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about right now but after passing the exam.</font>

665
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,900
<font color="yellow">Let me give you a piece of advice.</font>

666
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,860
<font color="yellow">You've got the timing all wrong.</font>

667
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,660
<font color="yellow">Did you have to say that in this situation?</font>

668
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,400
<font color="yellow">Pass the exam first.</font>

669
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,500
<font color="yellow">You must be hallucinating.</font>

670
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,260
<font color="yellow">She wasn't even pregnant and she faked it.</font>

671
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,530
<font color="yellow">She was trying to drag you down!</font>

672
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,200
<font color="yellow">How could you talk about her in that way?</font>

673
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,630
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon almost died because of you.</font>

674
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,830
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry her...</font>

675
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,500
<font color="yellow">regardless of what you say.</font>

676
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
<font color="yellow">That's the end of us, then.</font>

677
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,830
<font color="yellow">You think I'm really smart and clever, right?</font>

678
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,160
<font color="yellow">I wasn't as smart as Gab Soon and there's nothing great about me.</font>

679
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,600
<font color="yellow">Only she would date a guy like me.</font>

680
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,860
<font color="yellow">No other women in this world would date somebody like me.</font>

681
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,600
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest.</font>

682
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,630
<font color="yellow">I'm jobless...</font>

683
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,030
<font color="yellow">and it's not like I have assets to inherit or a rich father.</font>

684
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,530
<font color="yellow">On top of that, there's you and Da Hae.</font>

685
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,660
<font color="yellow">I have to look after both of you. Who's going to want me?</font>

686
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,330
<font color="yellow">This is the reality, Mum.</font>

687
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,730
<font color="yellow">You think I'm handsome?</font>

688
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,060
<font color="yellow">There are loads of guys on the street that look like me.</font>

689
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,230
<font color="yellow">- I agree. - Gab Soon is a good person.</font>

690
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,560
<font color="yellow">You know as well as I do that she took care of me for 10 years.</font>

691
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,630
<font color="yellow">She'd work on part-time jobs to the point that her legs are sore...</font>

692
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,560
<font color="yellow">so that she can buy me gimbap and tteokbokki.</font>

693
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,700
<font color="yellow">She even gave me money.</font>

694
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

695
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,130
<font color="yellow">How can you say that to Mum?</font>

696
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,330
<font color="yellow">Think about everything Mum did for you.</font>

697
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,130
<font color="yellow">She had you in her womb for 10 months,</font>

698
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,200
<font color="yellow">fed you, clothed you and sent you to school without Dad.</font>

699
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,530
<font color="yellow">Don't you compare that to gimbap and tteokbokki</font>

700
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,500
<font color="yellow">She was hospitalised because of you so you should have asked about her.</font>

701
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,660
<font color="yellow">How could you be so heartless?</font>

702
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,860
<font color="yellow">Is this the kind of person you are?</font>

703
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,900
<font color="yellow">I'm so disappointed in you.</font>

704
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,970
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

705
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,000
<font color="yellow">After all I did to raise you, you get swayed by a girl...</font>

706
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,760
<font color="yellow">and go against your mum?</font>

707
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,000
<font color="yellow">Is she more important than your own mum?</font>

708
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,100
<font color="yellow">She lived with me for a while.</font>

709
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,300
<font color="yellow">Can you accept a daughter-in-law who used to live with another guy?</font>

710
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,530
<font color="yellow">If I betray her after living with her, I can't be considered a human.</font>

711
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,430
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take care of Gab Soon...</font>

712
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,760
<font color="yellow">and I hope you and Da Hae accept her for who she is.</font>

713
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,860
<font color="yellow">Stop talking rubbish. Get out!</font>

714
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,030
<font color="yellow">How stubborn. She must have talked him into it.</font>

715
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,560
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

716
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,470
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

717
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,230
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for yelling at you.</font>

718
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,230
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

719
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,830
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

720
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,600
<font color="yellow">Mum, this is not right.</font>

721
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,960
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

722
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,700
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can do for you.</font>

723
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,600
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I have no asset for you to inherit...</font>

724
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,930
<font color="yellow">and once I get old, I'll be a burden to you.</font>

725
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,530
<font color="yellow">I haven't saved up for my later years.</font>

726
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,760
<font color="yellow">I go out to work early in the morning...</font>

727
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,160
<font color="yellow">so that I don't leave you debt but I'm always in this mess.</font>

728
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,230
<font color="yellow">Your sister will be in mess all her life.</font>

729
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,430
<font color="yellow">In the end, both of us will burden you.</font>

730
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

731
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,200
<font color="yellow">I want you to be happy.</font>

732
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,200
<font color="yellow">I don't care what anybody in this world says...</font>

733
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,100
<font color="yellow">as long as you're happy.</font>

734
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,730
<font color="yellow">If I was better off,</font>

735
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,830
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have said no to the woman you love.</font>

736
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,930
<font color="yellow">If you had a stable job, I wouldn't say no.</font>

737
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,600
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

738
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,530
<font color="yellow">you both have nothing so it won't make things better.</font>

739
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,960
<font color="yellow">You're still young so you may not know...</font>

740
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,030
<font color="yellow">but I can see through it.</font>

741
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,460
<font color="yellow">I know how you two will live.</font>

742
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,030
<font color="yellow">Just because you're young and you like each other,</font>

743
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,630
<font color="yellow">it doesn't mean that things will work out.</font>

744
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,100
<font color="yellow">You are not well off...</font>

745
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,130
<font color="yellow">and you're not good enough so you have to meet a better woman.</font>

746
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,760
<font color="yellow">You can't survive in this world as the sole provider of the household.</font>

747
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,430
<font color="yellow">You need to meet a rich, competent woman to have a better life.</font>

748
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,260
<font color="yellow">Are you going to live worrying about feeding yourselves and your baby?</font>

749
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,900
<font color="yellow">I don't want that. I don't want you to live like that.</font>

750
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,630
<font color="yellow">If you had to marry her at any cost,</font>

751
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
<font color="yellow">go ahead.</font>

752
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,330
<font color="yellow">Rather than watching you marry her...</font>

753
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,460
<font color="yellow">- Mum! - Mum!</font>

754
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,500
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

755
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,660
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

756
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,660
<font color="yellow">I asked the boss to pay me in advance,</font>

757
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,460
<font color="yellow">but he said he could only give me 100 dollars. What should we do?</font>

758
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,400
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

759
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,100
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol!</font>

760
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,300
<font color="yellow">(Sokcho)</font>

761
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,130
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's this house...</font>

762
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,730
<font color="yellow">or if we're just unlucky.</font>

763
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,700
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Gab Dol.</font>

764
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,960
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for his mum, too.</font>

765
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,130
<font color="yellow">Not Da Hae, though.</font>

766
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,930
<font color="yellow">What is it, Professor? Can you not think of an idea?</font>

767
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,460
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - That's what you said last time.</font>

768
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,430
<font color="yellow">You said women must be inspired...</font>

769
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,560
<font color="yellow">and men must have ideas.</font>

770
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,760
<font color="yellow">I can't think about anything today.</font>

771
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,360
<font color="yellow">My soul feels complicated.</font>

772
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,200
<font color="yellow">My head gets complicated.</font>

773
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,260
<font color="yellow">You're different from a normal person.</font>

774
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
<font color="yellow">Let's sit quietly and meditate.</font>

775
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,530
<font color="yellow">Close your eyes.</font>

776
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,230
<font color="yellow">Who are you thinking about?</font>

777
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not thinking about anybody. What about you?</font>

778
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,860
<font color="yellow">King Sejong.</font>

779
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,930
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about King Sejong the Great in the green background.</font>

780
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,530
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about Shin Saimdang as well.</font>

781
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,900
<font color="yellow">Shin Saimdang in the yellow background.</font>

782
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,200
<font color="yellow">The Great Shin Saimdang.</font>

783
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,800
<font color="yellow">Shin what? Is she that famous?</font>

784
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,230
<font color="yellow">Of course. She's the best of the best.</font>

785
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,360
<font color="yellow">Next are Yulgok Yi I and Toegye Yi Hwang.</font>

786
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,430
<font color="yellow">They're strangers to me...</font>

787
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,560
<font color="yellow">but I miss them dearly.</font>

788
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,700
<font color="yellow">I miss the coins as well.</font>

789
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,330
<font color="yellow">The coins?</font>

790
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,800
<font color="yellow">Admiral Yi Sun Shin.</font>

791
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,200
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes.</font>

792
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,430
<font color="yellow">King Sejong, Shin Saimdang, Admiral Yi Sun Shin.</font>

793
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,400
<font color="yellow">You know where they appear, right?</font>

794
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,000
<font color="yellow">I've heard of them.</font>

795
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,330
<font color="yellow">Think carefully.</font>

796
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,260
<font color="yellow">We can't live without them.</font>

797
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,560
<font color="yellow">King Sejong, Admiral Yi Sun Shin. And who was that again?</font>

798
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,560
<font color="yellow">Shin Saimdang.</font>

799
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,230
<font color="yellow">The yellow background.</font>

800
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,560
<font color="yellow">King Sejong, Admiral Yi Sun Shin...</font>

801
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,730
<font color="yellow">and Shin Saimdang.</font>

802
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,860
<font color="yellow">I got it!</font>

803
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,000
<font color="yellow">Do you get it?</font>

804
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,230
<font color="yellow">You think I wouldn't know that?</font>

805
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,660
<font color="yellow">They're all lead characters of historical dramas.</font>

806
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,330
<font color="yellow">I got it right.</font>

807
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,230
<font color="yellow">Is this reality or a dream?</font>

808
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,430
<font color="yellow">Is this for real or not?</font>

809
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,030
<font color="yellow">Who's your mum seeing these days?</font>

810
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,830
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

811
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,700
<font color="yellow">I need to do a secret investigation on her.</font>

812
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,560
<font color="yellow">Give her some freedom.</font>

813
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,760
<font color="yellow">She has a lot to do at work.</font>

814
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,430
<font color="yellow">Your mum doesn't handle freedom well.</font>

815
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,800
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo. You know I trust you, right?</font>

816
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,600
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

817
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,500
<font color="yellow">You can't make me angry like your mum.</font>

818
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,800
<font color="yellow">If I get into an argument with your mum, you have to take my side.</font>

819
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,560
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

820
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,200
<font color="yellow">Where were you going about?</font>

821
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,000
<font color="yellow">Listen to me while you're at my house being fed by me.</font>

822
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,400
<font color="yellow">Stop going around dating any fool.</font>

823
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,960
<font color="yellow">He's not a fool.</font>

824
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,600
<font color="yellow">He watches a lot of historical dramas. He knows a lot.</font>

825
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,860
<font color="yellow">He's a professor so he's different.</font>

826
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,300
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

827
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,130
<font color="yellow">Grandpa!</font>

828
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,560
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. My Ddol Ee.</font>

829
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,730
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

830
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,800
<font color="yellow">Didn't you miss me?</font>

831
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,000
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

832
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,530
<font color="yellow">Grandpa. Were you really sick?</font>

833
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,760
<font color="yellow">I'm all good now.</font>

834
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,830
<font color="yellow">I had this in my pocket. Do you want it?</font>

835
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,860
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

836
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,860
<font color="yellow">Are you close to your sisters? Are they nice to you?</font>

837
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,260
<font color="yellow">I'm not close to them. They hit me.</font>

838
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,600
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

839
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,300
<font color="yellow">They take my toys.</font>

840
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,660
<font color="yellow">You should take theirs, too.</font>

841
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,400
<font color="yellow">Don't let them hit you.</font>

842
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,830
<font color="yellow">Why would you? Hit them back.</font>

843
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,460
<font color="yellow">Mum cried.</font>

844
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,100
<font color="yellow">Why? Why did she cry?</font>

845
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,430
<font color="yellow">I don't know. She cries once in a while.</font>

846
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,760
<font color="yellow">There was no smoke.</font>

847
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:32,430
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

848
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,460
<font color="yellow">Is it Geum Sik?</font>

849
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,500
<font color="yellow">It's me, Joong Nyeon.</font>

850
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,700
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

851
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,630
<font color="yellow">Do you have time for dinner?</font>

852
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,460
<font color="yellow">Let's have soju together.</font>

853
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,100
<font color="yellow">I already have dinner plans.</font>

854
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,100
<font color="yellow">That won't work, then.</font>

855
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,330
<font color="yellow">Are you free any other time during the week?</font>

856
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,100
<font color="yellow">This week is a bit tough.</font>

857
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,600
<font color="yellow">I'll call you another time.</font>

858
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,530
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

859
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,460
<font color="yellow">I'll wait for your call.</font>

860
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,430
<font color="yellow">Talk to you later.</font>

861
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,130
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

862
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,360
<font color="yellow">- It's me. - Yes, Geum Sik.</font>

863
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,830
<font color="yellow">I changed my dinner plan. Let's meet today.</font>

864
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,560
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Geum Sik.</font>

865
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,530
<font color="yellow">I'll make an appointment at my favourite restaurant.</font>

866
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,430
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. We don't have to go to a Japanese restaurant.</font>

867
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,260
<font color="yellow">We don't have to go to an expensive restaurant.</font>

868
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,460
<font color="yellow">We can go somewhere I know well.</font>

869
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,660
<font color="yellow">Sure. See you later.</font>

870
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,500
<font color="yellow">It's a bit shabby, right?</font>

871
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,160
<font color="yellow">You don't belong to a place like this but their food is good.</font>

872
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,760
<font color="yellow">Your clothes might start smelling.</font>

873
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,660
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I like places like this.</font>

874
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,760
<font color="yellow">- Have a drink. - Let me pour you a drink.</font>

875
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,800
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

876
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,260
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me. - Thanks.</font>

877
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,160
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

878
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:25,530
<font color="yellow">They say businesses are difficult to run. You're incredible.</font>

879
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,830
<font color="yellow">You have to take care of your health for your family.</font>

880
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,000
<font color="yellow">Let me do that.</font>

881
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,560
<font color="yellow">There are ways of doing this right.</font>

882
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,900
<font color="yellow">You won't know if you haven't done it before.</font>

883
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,130
<font color="yellow">Here. It's ready. You can eat it now.</font>

884
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
<font color="yellow">Eat up too.</font>

885
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,360
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

886
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,030
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is a boy,</font>

887
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,260
<font color="yellow">so he might not get along well with the girls.</font>

888
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,200
<font color="yellow">When boys grow up,</font>

889
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,160
<font color="yellow">they tend to be more understanding.</font>

890
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,630
<font color="yellow">But he's young now.</font>

891
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,430
<font color="yellow">I think Ddol Ee is scared of his sisters.</font>

892
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,230
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Jang.</font>

893
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,230
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr Jo. What brings you here?</font>

894
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,200
<font color="yellow">I'm having dinner with someone.</font>

895
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,800
<font color="yellow">I'm a regular here since 30 years ago.</font>

896
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,800
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

897
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,230
<font color="yellow">Things got settled well last time thanks to you.</font>

898
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,460
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

899
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,700
<font color="yellow">How is your wife doing?</font>

900
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,200
<font color="yellow">I never saw her since the wedding.</font>

901
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,560
<font color="yellow">How many kids do you have?</font>

902
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,830
<font color="yellow">I have two girls.</font>

903
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,530
<font color="yellow">You should have a son.</font>

904
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, maybe.</font>

905
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,900
<font color="yellow">- We should get together soon. - Sure.</font>

906
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,460
<font color="yellow">- Go in. - Okay.</font>

907
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,430
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you sometime. - All right.</font>

908
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

909
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,560
<font color="yellow">He's an important client.</font>

910
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,400
<font color="yellow">It's all right. Don't mind me.</font>

911
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,430
<font color="yellow">What were you saying earlier?</font>

912
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,630
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

913
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,760
<font color="yellow">- Go on and eat. - Okay.</font>

914
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,060
<font color="yellow">Thank you for making time for me today.</font>

915
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,230
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it. Take care.</font>

916
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

917
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,600
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of...</font>

918
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,000
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee and Jae Soon.</font>

919
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,800
<font color="yellow">Would you like some fruit?</font>

920
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,530
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

921
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,200
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

922
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,000
<font color="yellow">Please don't report everything about our family.</font>

923
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,330
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

924
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,500
<font color="yellow">You must have said something for him to say it.</font>

925
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,430
<font color="yellow">He said Ddol Ee is scared of his sisters.</font>

926
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,400
<font color="yellow">Did you meet with Dad?</font>

927
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,060
<font color="yellow">If you have things to say, tell me directly.</font>

928
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,260
<font color="yellow">We should fix things together.</font>

929
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,030
<font color="yellow">I don't like the idea of getting other people involved.</font>

930
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,330
<font color="yellow">Put yourself in my shoes.</font>

931
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,130
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you feel the same?</font>

932
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry if it upset you.</font>

933
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not upset.</font>

934
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,060
<font color="yellow">I don't want others talking about our family.</font>

935
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,900
<font color="yellow">Dad is also our family.</font>

936
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,330
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

937
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,130
<font color="yellow">We haven't talked in days. I'm worried.</font>

938
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,130
<font color="yellow">Are you stuck at home?</font>

939
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,400
<font color="yellow">I'm grounded too.</font>

940
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,460
<font color="yellow">Did you get your phone taken too?</font>

941
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,630
<font color="yellow">Please text me.</font>

942
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,360
<font color="yellow">I miss you, Gab Dol.</font>

943
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,830
<font color="yellow">Are you busy, Mum?</font>

944
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,200
<font color="yellow">I miss you. Do you have time?</font>

945
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,660
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

946
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:53,160
<font color="yellow">Let's meet up.</font>

947
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,600
<font color="yellow">I'm going to see the kids.</font>

948
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,830
<font color="yellow">Is that what you had to say?</font>

949
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,160
<font color="yellow">Why are you not letting me see them?</font>

950
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,300
<font color="yellow">You even missed the open day. You're not doing it right.</font>

951
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,630
<font color="yellow">Things just happened.</font>

952
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,830
<font color="yellow">I won't make you worry. You stay out of it.</font>

953
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:30,860
<font color="yellow">They are my children. I have the right to see them.</font>

954
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,600
<font color="yellow">- What right? - Don't get worked up.</font>

955
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,730
<font color="yellow">- I'm their mother. - You're so shameless.</font>

956
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,730
<font color="yellow">Did you forget why we divorced?</font>

957
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,360
<font color="yellow">Did you forget what you did?</font>

958
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,730
<font color="yellow">What's that got to do with me seeing my children?</font>

959
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,700
<font color="yellow">I had no idea I'd get divorced.</font>

960
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,800
<font color="yellow">It became a trauma, I can't trust people any more.</font>

961
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,700
<font color="yellow">I got remarried for the kids,</font>

962
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,500
<font color="yellow">but nobody knows about my divorce or remarriage.</font>

963
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,960
<font color="yellow">I'm too embarrassed to even tell my friends.</font>

964
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,430
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you any more. Leave me alone.</font>

965
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,800
<font color="yellow">I know I did wrong.</font>

966
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,730
<font color="yellow">I admitted when we divorced.</font>

967
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,260
<font color="yellow">And I let you divorce me.</font>

968
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,260
<font color="yellow">But you made me like that.</font>

969
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,160
<font color="yellow">You left me lonely, busy with your work.</font>

970
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,560
<font color="yellow">I worked to make money.</font>

971
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,160
<font color="yellow">Was that for my sake?</font>

972
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,360
<font color="yellow">Money is just money. Don't make excuses.</font>

973
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,660
<font color="yellow">You stop making excuses.</font>

974
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,760
<font color="yellow">You drank and spent money like water because you were lonely?</font>

975
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,760
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to mention it.</font>

976
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,430
<font color="yellow">I was always like that.</font>

977
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,930
<font color="yellow">You were the one chasing around me. Why are you complaining now?</font>

978
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,400
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd change if we get married.</font>

979
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,360
<font color="yellow">I even suffered from postpartum depression.</font>

980
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,860
<font color="yellow">Is that why you did that?</font>

981
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,530
<font color="yellow">Jerk.</font>

982
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
<font color="yellow">Must you hurt me like this?</font>

983
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,760
<font color="yellow">Whatever you say, I'll meet them.</font>

984
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,060
<font color="yellow">- Don't. - I will.</font>

985
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,530
<font color="yellow">- Don't. - I will.</font>

986
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,630
<font color="yellow">Go on. Hit me.</font>

987
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,760
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a piece of advice.</font>

988
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:01,230
<font color="yellow">Don't forget I won't stay still.</font>

989
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,360
<font color="yellow">- You haven't changed a bit. - You think you have?</font>

990
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,830
<font color="yellow">Please leave me alone, and live quietly.</font>

991
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:12,630
<font color="yellow">You are a shameful mother to show my children.</font>

992
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,130
<font color="yellow">I beg you.</font>

995
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,030
<font color="yellow">How about dinner?</font>

01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,000

999
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,460
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Don't worry.</font>

<font color="yellow">I couldn't reach you for so long.</font>

1003
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,200
<font color="yellow">It was so hard to get out. They're keeping a close eye on me.</font>

1004
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,260
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?</font>

<font color="yellow">break up.</font>

1008
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,000
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

1009
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:48,860
<font color="yellow">You must be stressed.</font>

1010

1036
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:11,430
<font color="yellow">I mean it.</font>

1037

<font color="yellow">Can you forget about me?</font>

1040
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,900
<font color="yellow">You said you need me.</font>

1041
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,800
<font color="yellow">You said you can't live without me.</font>

1042
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,430
<font color="yellow">How can we break up?</font>

1043
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,160
<font color="yellow">We have so many memories.</font>

1044
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,330
<font color="yellow">We even lived together.</font>

1045
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,430

01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:16,800
<font color="yellow">Return them.</font>

1074
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,960
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to earn more money for my children's sake.</font>

1075
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,330
<font color="yellow">Si Nae!</font>

1076
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:23,130
<font color="yellow">Give the money back now.</font>

1077
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,330
<font color="yellow">You stole it.</font>

1078
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,830
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik invited us to his house.</font>

1079
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:30,060
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon didn't fall in love with the guy.</font>

1080
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,060
<font color="yellow">She married him for the money. There is no affection between them.</font>

1081
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,460
<font color="yellow">Why are you slacking off from work? Where have you been?</font>

1082
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,660
<font color="yellow">What if you get fired?</font>

1083
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,030
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're annoying!</font>

1084
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,330
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business. We don't need you. Get out!</font>
