00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,870
(Waiting for Godot)

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,200
(Episode 3)

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,100
We're ready. Please step out.

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,700
What is all this?

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,230
It's a building completion ceremony.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,670
Building completion ceremony?

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,500
A ceremony to celebrate the completion of a building.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,630
It's not even their house.

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,600
- Please take a photo of us.
 -  Okay.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,830
We will now begin the building completion ceremony ritual.

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,830
Due to time constraint,

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,070
we will skip the salute to national flag and national anthem.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,800
Go on.

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,330
We will now cut the tape.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,770
After we cut the tape, please give a big hand.

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,750
Let's begin.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,600
In 3, 2, 1.

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,600
That's not even funny.

19
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,300
Don't drink and come home early.

20
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,420
You should have used a pig's head.

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,270
It's not because of money issues.

22
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,570
We could buy twelve of those.

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,070
Don't get us wrong.

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,620
We don't belong in a house like this.

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,770
I used to...

26
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,500
We never used to belong in a house like this.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,000
Even my son's name is Geum Soo Jo,

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,530
which means he was born with a golden spoon.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,470
Do you remember my name? You saw it when I signed the contract.

30
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,370
Geum Do Geum.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,600
I have two characters that stand for gold in my name.

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,300
Whatever. Just make sure to pay your rent on time.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,500
We've already paid for the toilet fee.

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,030
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,630
Toilet fee.

36
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,000
She should have given me the money.

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,730
I think we made a mistake in letting them in.

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,980
What golden spoon?

39
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,460
What kind of a name is Geum Do Geum?

40
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,150
They're Geum Do Geum Soo Jo.

41
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,940
They don't seem like bad people.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,900
Don't you even talk to them. You belong in a different pool.

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,830
Don't you think things will work out?

44
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,230
I think we'll do well in this house.

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,000
The daughter in the main building seems great.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Women without money has no charm.

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,870
She seems tawdry.

48
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,320
- What are you waiting for?
 -  Godot.

49
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,470
What's Godot?

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,430
My goodness.

51
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,870
Let's tell our parents first.

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,730
No. You know how things are.

53
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,900
They'll be disappointed.

54
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Gab Dol needs to know. He's the father.

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,100
No. He'll run away.

56
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,970
Then what do you want to do? You must have a plan.

57
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,130
I don't know. I really don't know.

58
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,500
My mind has gone completely blank.

59
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,400
I can't think of anything. I don't want to think.

60
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,770
- What can we do?
 -  I think I might lose my mind.

61
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,870
Could you bring my phone from the house?

62
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,130
Don't get caught.

63
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,570
Is nobody home?

64
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,800
Okay, Mum.

65
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,030
No. I was just asking. Okay.

66
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,870
My goodness.

67
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,530
What?

68
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,430
Aunt.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,220
It's not what you think it is.

70
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,670
I've been through it all.

71
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,930
I'm living proof.

72
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,300
I can fix it.

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Hello.

74
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,800
Jae Soon.

75
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,370
Jae Soon.

76
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,570
What's becoming of her?

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,570
Why did she say hello?

78
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,470
Jae Soon.

79
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,450
- Mum.
 -  Why did you come?

80
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,880
I told you that I wasn't home.

81
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,820
I was in the area. I came to see what food you made.

82
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,830
Food?

83
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,420
Come to think of it, I need to make food for Gab Soon.

84
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,310
- When do you have time?
 -  Why would you go there?

85
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,390
Why not?

86
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,320
Don't go. I don't have time either.

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,280
Then I'll go on my own.

88
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,780
I said, don't go.

89
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,520
You'll only get in the way of her studying.

90
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,060
It's not like she can't study because she can't eat.

91
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,420
Why would the whole family go there? There's no point in going there.

92
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,900
Why do you think she chose to go?

93
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,490
You are no help. She doesn't need food.

94
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,700
Am I right or wrong?

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,180
You're suddenly so logical.

96
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,630
Did you take speech lessons?

97
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,560
I made such a scene to get this.

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,380
- Did you get caught?
 -  Who do you think I am?

99
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm good at things like this.

100
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,170
You must be hungry. Let's eat something.

101
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm not hungry.

102
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,790
Oh gosh. Hide.

103
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,800
Why?

104
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,670
Run!

105
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,110
Wait.

106
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,200
Gab Soon. Jae Soon.

107
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,970
Gab Soon.

108
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,130
- It hurts.
 -  Oh my.

109
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,170
Gab Soon.

110
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,900
What should we do?

111
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,160
Pretend you didn't see her.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,910
She saw us.

113
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,970
She's alone. We have each other.

114
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,330
Being stubborn will solve it all.

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,430
Think things out while staying here.

116
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,820
- Are you here to pay?
 -  I'll pay with card.

117
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,470
I'd like to pay for a week in advance.

118
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,140
(President Jo Geum Sik)

119
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,670
(Approved: 77 dollars at Fire Dry Sauna)

120
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm home.

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,470
You must be hungry. Go take a quick shower.

122
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,470
It smells good.

123
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,270
I made bulgogi.

124
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,430
Do you want to try?

125
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,620
How does it taste?

126
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,210
I made it a bit sweet for the kids.

127
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,230
It's tasty.

128
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,670
You're a great cook.

129
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,900
Did you go somewhere today?

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,220
No. Why?

131
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,870
Never mind. Let's eat dinner. I'm hungry.

132
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,900
What?

133
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,630
You're talking nonsense.

134
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,370
Say something.

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,930
Mal Nyeon. Are you going to keep like this?

136
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,720
I saw her.

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
She's in the temple studying. Why would she be in Seoul?

138
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,610
How would I know?

139
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,670
Gab Soon and Jae Soon ran away as soon as they saw me.

140
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,420
Don't be daft.

141
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,770
I'm not.

142
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,610
I guess Gab Soon couldn't handle the pressure here,

143
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,370
so she went to the temple.

144
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,030
But she couldn't concentrate on her studies over there either.

145
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,040
She couldn't concentrate in the first place.

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,970
I bet she came here because of Gab Dol.

147
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,990
How could she not? They dated for 10 years.

148
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,070
Jae Soon.

149
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,160
Did you see your aunt at the dry sauna today or not?

150
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,870
What are you talking about?

151
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,410
Why would I go there?

152
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,630
Your aunt insists that...

153
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,120
she saw you and Gab Soon at the dry sauna.

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,370
It's driving me crazy.

155
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,470
What's wrong with her?

156
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,130
Don't mind her. I didn't go.

157
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,500
Gab Soon's studying hard in the temple.

158
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,960
She says that she never went.

159
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,410
I thought you've gotten better.

160
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,500
What's wrong with you?

161
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,800
They can't fool me.

162
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,790
Go to the temple. I bet Gab Soon isn't there.

163
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,500
Do something with your sister.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,230
- Mal Nyeon.
 -  My goodness.

165
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,850
If you're like this, I'm really all on my own.

166
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,580
I'm the one on my own.

167
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,840
You wait and see.

168
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,200
We'll hear weeping soon.

169
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,300
Give up on Gab Soon.

170
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,750
I've seen plenty of parents weeping because of their child.

171
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,100
I've been through it all. I sure have.

172
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,770
Hey!

173
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,760
Please tell her to leave.

174
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,820
I don't need her money. Send her away.

175
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,260
Don't mind her. Just ignore her.

176
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,970
I can't ignore her.

177
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,700
It's not the first time she's made a fuss like this.

178
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,670
What she says comes true.

179
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm in Seoul. Let's meet.

180
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm pregnant.

181
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,030
- I thought you quit playing games.
 -  Starting tomorrow.

182
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,820
Have you quit studying?

183
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,900
I would love to but I can't.

184
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,370
Gab Soon went to the temple to study. What are you doing?

185
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,260
What if Gab Soon passes?

186
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,470
She'll break up with you instantly.

187
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,590
Don't you know her?

188
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,890
She's firm.

189
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,680
She can't break up with me.

190
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,560
There's no man like me.

191
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,030
She must have done good deeds in her past life.

192
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,700
How arrogant.

193
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,990
You look lively.

194
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,150
I'm so happy now that...

195
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,030
I don't have to hear Gab Soon's nagging.

196
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,600
Gab Dol's day without Gab Soon.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,270
What are you doing here?

198
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,630
I came to buy some books.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
Why did you come all the way here?

200
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,670
I could've sent you the books if you called.

201
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,570
I'm studying so hard.

202
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,870
I've quit everything else.

203
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,200
Have you gained weight?

204
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,890
What are you talking about?

205
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,530
I'm just kidding.

206
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,920
Why are you drinking milk?

207
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm fed up with coffee.

208
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,670
Don't you want something to drink?

209
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,610
Nobody's forcing us. Let's just stay with one drink.

210
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,700
I don't have any money.

211
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,530
What's the matter?

212
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm concerned about my friend that I met earlier.

213
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,500
- Which friend?
 -  Somebody.

214
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,730
She has a boyfriend.

215
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,230
They didn't even discuss about getting married,

216
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,500
but she's pregnant.

217
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,820
And her boyfriend is unemployed.

218
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,300
That sounds suffocating.

219
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,100
Look at the news.

220
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,330
Unemployed people are five times less likely to get married.

221
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,860
What's wrong with your friend?

222
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,560
She should have been careful.

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,730
Didn't they use contraceptives?

224
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,120
It was a mistake.

225
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,630
That's too big of a mistake.

226
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,100
What did you tell her?

227
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,690
I told her to talk it out.

228
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,070
There's nothing to talk about. They need to break up.

229
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,050
Break up? They have a baby.

230
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,130
- Would you if it were you?
 -  Of course.

231
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,530
I hate those kind of women who are inconsiderate of their men.

232
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,070
Think about it.

233
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,100
She's pregnant and asks him to be responsible when he has no job.

234
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,270
That's dragging him down.

235
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,430
All men will be aghast.

236
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,090
I don't even want to think about it.

237
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,430
How could you be exactly as I predicted you would be?

238
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,330
I was a fool to have wanted to talk with you.

239
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,100
Why are you like that?

240
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,520
You must feel too connected to your friend.

241
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,510
Can't you be more humane?

242
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,600
Aghast?

243
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,330
I'm being realistic.

244
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,600
Quit meeting friends like her.

245
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,670
Meet sophisticated friends.

246
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,630
I'm sorry I don't meet your standard.

247
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,530
You're going to finish your drink, right?

248
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,380
You're leaving?

249
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,070
My mum wants me to receive a parcel.

250
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,570
It's marinated crab. I need to put it in the refrigerator right away.

251
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,770
I'll go see you in the temple sometime.

252
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,970
You won't be able to see me.

253
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,130
You must be studying hard.

254
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,800
Don't you pass by yourself.

255
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,170
I'll be off.

256
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,370
Heo Gab Dol.

257
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,330
I wasn't talking about my friend. I was talking about me.

258
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Say it again.

259
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,290
It's about you?

260
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,620
Not me. It's about us.

261
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,670
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

262
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,300
I'm sorry that I'm a low-life...

263
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,800
who's pregnant when you are unemployed...

264
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,330
and dragging your life down.

265
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,570
What are we going to do?

266
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,970
Spend it well, Nae Shim.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,030
Do you mind transferring the money to my account from now on?

268
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,630
Transfer?

269
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,630
I meant money transfer. You can send it directly to my bank account.

270
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,700
I've never done it before.

271
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,670
This is inconvenient for both of us.

272
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,300
That's something you have to deal with.

273
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,230
I don't want your family to go hungry.

274
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,400
I'm just joking.

275
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,920
Isn't it nice that we get to meet each other once a month?

276
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,770
We can come out for a coffee and look elegant.

277
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,700
Hotel coffee tastes different, right?

278
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,270
I don't think this is my type. I'll get going.

279
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,430
Why don't you stay? I'm sure you don't get these chances often.

280
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,970
I don't have time lying around.

281
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,310
I have errands to run. Bye.

282
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,570
You must have been making kimchi before you came out.

283
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,500
Oh dear.

284
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,100
You're back.

285
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,170
What a bossy woman!

286
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,730
I made my son a doctor and look what I'm doing.

287
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,570
How much money did we pour into him during six years of medical school?

288
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,440
She gives me less than 2,000 dollars and she goes,

289
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,510
"Spend it well, Nae Shim."

290
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,100
"You must have been making kimchi before you came out."

291
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,700
She calls me by name and speaks low of me all the time.

292
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,540
She's years below me.

293
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,700
This is all your fault.

294
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,900
We wouldn't be in this situation if you took good care of the pension.

295
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,570
You should go and get the money from next month.

296
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,430
Nae Shim. Drink some cold water and cool down.

297
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,000
Here. Don't abuse your precious husband.

298
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,500
Why are you not speaking out for yourself?

299
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,310
You should speak to your in-law like when you talk to Joong Nyeon.

300
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,400
Mal Nyeon, don't say anything. She'll get more upset.

301
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Leave. Both of you, leave.

302
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,070
My goodness.

303
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,300
I have a headache.

304
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,430
Are you daydreaming?

305
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,930
Why do you do that once in a while?

306
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,600
You had stellar grades in school and you're very skilled,

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
but I don't understand you sometimes.

308
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,570
Tell me what the problem is.

309
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,900
There's nothing wrong.

310
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,900
How did you know to find me here?

311
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,800
I just had a hunch. You have something to say, right?

312
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,140
No, I don't.

313
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,570
I think you do.

314
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,470
Tell me what it is.

315
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,400
Let's have a drink later. It's on me.

316
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,400
What? What did you do?

317
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,270
I was clueless...

318
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,600
and I was crazy enough to do anything I can to support you.

319
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,370
Would you accept yourself as a son? You punk!

320
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,970
Why are you here, Relief Patch?

321
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,730
I don't have relief patch on me today.

322
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,050
I told you I don't need a caregiver.

323
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,620
Are you going to leave me up to the caregiver and roam around?

324
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,900
You do it. You!

325
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,870
But I can't give you a bath.

326
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,670
Do I have to give him a bath?

327
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,410
I'm just saying. He can do everything on his own.

328
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,730
He just gets anxious when nobody else is home.

329
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,240
- I see.
 -  I don't need her. Send her back.

330
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,150
Dad, you fired the housekeeper so imagine if I left for grocery.

331
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,500
What if something happens to you during that time?

332
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,280
What was it? Was it five minutes?

333
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,000
They can't save you after a certain time. You never know what'll happen.

334
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,610
- Did you do a background check?
 -  Sorry?

335
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,500
Is she trustworthy?

336
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,200
I did a check. She has no criminal record and she was never a spy.

337
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,720
Has she ever been a caregiver?

338
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,150
- I haven't...
 -  She's done it a lot, Dad.

339
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,200
- What about certification?
 -  I'm planning to get one.

340
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,740
Why would you trust a person who's not even certified?

341
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,170
If something goes wrong with me, will she take responsibility?

342
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,700
You can't trust people these days. Why would you bring a random person?

343
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,110
You are being too harsh right in front of my face.

344
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,070
I'm not just a random person.

345
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,830
Money doesn't give you the right to look down on others.

346
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,580
Fire her right away.

347
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,140
You can't fire me without hiring me.

348
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,270
I came all the way sacrificing my time.

349
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,230
Pay me for one hour at least!

350
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,670
What 1 hour? It hasn't even been 5 minutes.

351
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,990
- I'll sue you, then.
 -  You can't do this.

352
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,590
Tell her to sue me.

353
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,370
Dad, if this leaks out to the media, it's your loss. It's abuse of power.

354
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
Then,

355
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,330
make her work for an hour and send her home with 10 dollars.

356
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,730
Tell her to wash her hands first.

357
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,300
You know the disinfectant Se Gye uses for surgery?

358
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,370
Tell her to use that and wear a mask.

359
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,930
Yes, Professor.

360
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,040
I was busy training the new caregiver.

361
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,100
Of course.

362
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,100
Let's meet up next week.

363
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,540
I miss you, too.

364
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,570
Fix the angle of the television.

365
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,530
- Like this?
 -  It should be angled towards me.

366
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,540
The other way.

367
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,270
Can't you do it properly?

368
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,470
- Is this good?
 -  Open the blinds.

369
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,830
- Like this?
 -  What was that? Be gentle.

370
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,230
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,030
I'm sorry. What's wrong with this?

372
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,100
May I leave?

373
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,600
There's one minute left.

374
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,730
- What's this?
 -  Ouch.

375
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,790
Oh dear. I'm sorry.

376
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,930
- Put me upright.
 -  Oh dear.

377
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,000
It's been exactly an hour.

378
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,530
I'll leave, then.

379
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,170
Hey, woman! Relief Patch!

380
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,770
Ma'am. Here you go.

381
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,300
You can keep it. I don't need your 10 dollars.

382
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Bring her back. Now!

383
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,570
Oh gosh.

384
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,400
Doesn't this look good?

385
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,560
You should be the one cooking from now on.

386
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,190
Both Mum and I are busy.

387
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,370
Don't waste your time. You should be studying.

388
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,400
Don't worry, Mum. Once I pass next time...

389
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,630
There's no next time. It's this year. That's what you said.

390
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,670
Of course.

391
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,030
Once I pass this year, I'll tear this place down and build...

392
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,340
a second or a third-story house.

393
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,220
So 1st floor is for you, 2nd floor is for me and 3rd is for her.

394
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,210
- Keep me out of it.
 -  Why would you count her in?

395
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,270
I feel bad for her.

396
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,770
I feel more bad for you. And I...

397
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,870
can't live with her.

398
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,430
Just eat and study. Why are you being so chatty?

399
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,300
Mum.

400
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,030
You know my childhood friend who got married last time?

401
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,230
- The professor?
 -  Yes.

402
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,800
She got pregnant before they were married.

403
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,130
- I'm so envious.
 -  You're envious?

404
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,630
What if your daughter-in-law got pregnant...

405
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,100
That's only when you can support yourself.

406
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,780
Do you know how worried I was when you were dating Gab Soon?

407
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,250
I couldn't even sleep thinking that someone incompetent like her...

408
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,110
might get pregnant and drag you down with her.

409
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,580
If a woman is old enough, she should take proper care of herself.

410
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,710
You must have been out of your mind.

411
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,300
Why would you date a petty girl like her?

412
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,960
She speaks bluntly to you just because you're the same age.

413
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,800
She has no job, looks or money.

414
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,990
She has nothing.

415
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,640
She has guts, she's bold and she's loyal.

416
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,700
She can fight, too.

417
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,550
And why is her name Gab Soon?

418
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,270
Well, he's Gab Dol.

419
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,760
That's why I hate her even more.

420
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,370
It sounds like they're a pair.

421
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,020
You bossed her around.

422
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,830
She came here voluntarily so why not?

423
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,220
Only an idiot like you would date Gab Soon.

424
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,980
Men these days are shrewd so they're very picky with women.

425
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,130
They won't date a woman if they don't have a good job or a family.

426
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,260
It's not like he has money.

427
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,960
He's got the looks.

428
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,060
On top of that,

429
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,300
you've just turned 29 but she's already 29.

430
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,930
That's the same.

431
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,700
Age is different for men and women.

432
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,020
You're good for another 10 years.

433
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,770
Just pass the exam and you can date a woman who's 10 years younger.

434
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,330
She never did anything for me.

435
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,790
It's not like she ever got me a sock for my birthday...

436
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,590
or a piece of apple for any holiday.

437
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,670
They don't sell a sock on its own or a piece of apple.

438
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,120
Why are you talking about Gab Soon all of a sudden?

439
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,100
Don't ever mention her again. You're making me lose my appetite.

440
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,700
Is she pregnant?

441
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,570
What?

442
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,740
Hello, is it Seokbulsa Temple?

443
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,300
Please, speak up.

444
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,530
I have bad hearing.

445
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,210
What did you say?

446
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,400
There's a student named...

447
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,970
Shin Gab Soon in your temple.

448
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,070
May I speak to her?

449
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,100
What did he say?

450
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,370
Where did I leave my hearing aid?

451
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,920
Ma'am!

452
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,240
- Her name is Shin Gab Soon...
 -  Sorry?

453
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,320
Who is it again?

454
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,270
It's a student.

455
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,190
A student?

456
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,500
Yes.

457
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,730
Is she doing well?

458
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,080
My goodness.

459
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,590
She's busy studying with a band around her head.

460
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,690
Is that right?

461
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,270
Would you like to speak to her?

462
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,970
No, it's okay.

463
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,030
I shouldn't interrupt her.

464
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,670
Thank you.

465
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,500
You see.

466
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,130
She's spending her time studying.

467
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,110
She has a band around her head...

468
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,770
and she's solely focused on her studies.

469
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,430
- It's not true.
 -  Don't act up.

470
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,700
You're isolating me from my family.

471
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
This is between us...

472
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,900
but we weren't going to have her...

473
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,970
and guess what?

474
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,270
Gab Soon is the most thoughtful one out of our three children.

475
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,960
She hasn't made it yet but watch. She'll become somebody important.

476
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,620
Sure she will.

477
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,420
Don't speak so carelessly.

478
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,920
If you ever do that again...

479
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,200
What?

480
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,670
Are you going to rip my mouth?

481
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,800
It looks like you are.

482
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,470
It doesn't matter. Gab Soon is in Seoul.

483
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,370
- Shin Mal Nyeon!
 -  Mal Nyeon!

484
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,080
Have some. You wanted naengmyeon.

485
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,560
You didn't have to do this.

486
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,630
We could have gone to a snack bar.

487
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,400
- Do you want me to cut it up?
 -  Sure.

488
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,670
Should we order more suyuk?

489
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,770
You don't have money. This is enough.

490
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,070
It's delicious.

491
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,230
Aren't you going to eat?

492
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,530
I will.

493
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,330
Gab Soon.

494
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,300
Let's...

495
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,930
have a baby later.

496
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,130
Later? Later when? What are you trying to say?

497
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,870
It's exactly what I said. Let's have a baby later.

498
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,260
What about this one? What am I supposed to do with it?

499
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,670
You know how it is.

500
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,530
We're in no circumstance to have a baby.

501
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,290
I don't even have a job.

502
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,090
You wanted to sleep on it for a few days...

503
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,580
and this is what you come to?

504
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,900
What's your conclusion, then?

505
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,930
Don't just get upset. Let's be realistic.

506
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,470
Can you tell your parents?

507
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,570
I can't.

508
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,170
Even if I did, I'll never be able to convince my mum...

509
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,680
and I couldn't bring myself to tell her that you got pregnant...

510
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,020
when she prays for me every day.

511
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,270
You only care about your mum.

512
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,190
You don't care about me at all, right?

513
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,680
I'm not taking sides.

514
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,780
I thought you'd be a man and take responsibility for it.

515
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,760
I thought you'd at least say, "I'll take care of it. Don't worry."

516
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,300
Is it being a man to promise something you can't do?

517
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,450
Women are so weird.

518
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,040
It's not like you want a baby at this point either.

519
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,730
What do you want to hear from me?

520
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,640
It's not like we can handle a baby.

521
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,770
We can't event take care of ourselves.

522
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,200
You can blame me but be reasonable about it.

523
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,400
You should have been careful.

524
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,430
What?

525
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,120
If you were careful, this wouldn't have happened!

526
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,390
What did you say?

527
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,760
Don't pick at what I say.

528
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,220
You dragged me!

529
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,700
You never said no!

530
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,020
If you gave me the sign, I wouldn't have done that.

531
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,250
How could you...

532
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,590
To put it bluntly, you're old enough to take care of yourself.

533
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,720
Why would you make the man take all the responsibility?

534
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,100
Aren't you responsible?

535
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,000
Would you be happy if I was miserable because of you?

536
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,700
I take that back.

537
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,770
I won't drag you down.

538
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,570
I'll go to the hospital so come when I call you.

539
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,330
What a jerk.

(Foetal Growth Process)

542
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,510
This is your first time, right?

543
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,100
- Yes.
 -  Please fill out this form.

(Department Gynaecology Questionnaire)

545
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,970
Are you the dad?

546
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,430
- Yes.
 -  You should have been careful.

547
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,670
You probably lived together without your parents' consent and did this.

548
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,070
I can tell whether you are a married couple or not.

549
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,770
You know abortion is illegal, right?

550
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,600
You should get married at any cost if you get pregnant.

551
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,100
You'll regret it later for doing this to your body.

552
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,510
You might become infertile.

553
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,340
You have to get tested...

554
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,370
so write down when your last period was...

555
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,740
and the date of your sexual intercourse.

556
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,470
Then, get a urine sample.

557
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,180
The baby is healthy, right?

558
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,440
Yes, the baby has a strong heartbeat, too.

559
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,330
I'm so happy for you. You couldn't get pregnant for a while.

560
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,350
You'll finally see the baby next month.

561
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,570
Yes.

562
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,890
Thank you.

563
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,470
- Take care.
 -  See you.

564
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,600
Be careful.

565
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,170
You have to watch it.

566
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,140
Mind your own business.

567
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,500
I'll raise the baby on my own.

568
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,200
Don't ever call me.

569
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,500
Consider it again.

570
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
No.

571
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,330
Being stubborn won't get you anything.

572
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm not being stubborn.

573
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,350
Let's tell Mum, then.

574
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,310
You know what she's going to make me do.

575
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,910
She'll drag me to the hospital.

576
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,500
This is impossible.

577
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,110
How are you going to do it all by yourself?

578
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,290
I always wanted to get married like every other people...

579
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,200
and raise my own kids.

580
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,550
My career is important to me,

581
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,300
but I always dreamed of having a happy family with Gab Dol.

582
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,830
But...

583
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,190
this happened.

584
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,200
That's what I mean.

585
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,860
I want you to get married like other people,

586
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,930
have babies and have a happy family.

587
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,030
This is not the right time.

588
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,320
- Like Gab Dol said...
 -  Stop it, Jae Soon.

589
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,400
You get so stubborn with strange things.

590
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,870
Do you know what it means to be a single mum?

591
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,160
Do you know how hard it is to raise a kid on your own?

592
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,730
Nobody in this world wants to be a single mum.

593
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,500
When I saw those women, I wondered why they'd do that to themselves.

594
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
But...

595
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,000
it's a living thing that came to me.

596
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,170
How could I betray it so that I can survive?

597
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,170
Let it go this once.

598
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,770
This one mistake might ruin your whole life.

599
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,700
Your baby's life, too.

600
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,770
You can say anything,

601
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,770
but please don't call it a mistake.

602
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,570
You should be on my side.

603
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,370
- You're good.
 -  I love babies.

604
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,370
I'll have many children.

605
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,130
With whom?

606
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,570
Gab Soon. Let's have a baby.

607
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
Stop it.

608
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,570
What's the matter? They all know we're together.

609
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,250
Gab Soon. Let's have...

610
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,940
a baby who looks like you, a baby who looks like me...

611
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,970
and a baby who looks like us. Let's have three children.

612
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,470
- Promise me.
 -  I promise you.

613
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,870
I'll raise the baby on my own. You should stay out of it.

614
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,100
Don't ever look for me. You jerk.

615
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,770
Gab Soon!

616
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,530
You fool. You can't do it alone.

617
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,700
I want to take my responsibility.

618
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,300
Let's have this baby.

619
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,590
Live together?

620
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,950
Let's live together until the baby comes.

621
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,920
That's absurd. We should get married first.

622
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
I don't want to just live together. I won't.

623
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,540
There is no other way.

624
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,070
You know what our parents are going to say.

625
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,420
Still, I don't want that.

626
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Can you tell other people that we live together proudly?

627
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,200
Can you tell our parents and friends that we live together?

628
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,680
People are not used to that idea yet.

629
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,500
They talk about living together before marriage on media,

630
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,700
but it's different in reality.

631
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,350
I don't want people to point a finger at us.

632
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,190
I'm scared and embarrassed.

633
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,940
Then convince your parents.

634
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,800
I'll convince my mum.

635
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,470
You're not confident, right? I don't want to do this either,

636
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,730
but this is the only option we have.

637
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,570
I don't want you to hide somewhere and have a baby alone.

638
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,470
I should be there with you.

639
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,130
I have nothing,

640
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,800
but I'll be there until the end.

641
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,000
Let's do this together.

642
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,170
Let's get a place first, and convince our parents later.

643
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,030
At the worst, they will only beat us up.

644
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,940
Stop sighing,

645
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,100
and stop crying.

646
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,170
You're with a baby.

647
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,730
- Trust me.
 -  How can I trust you?

648
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,940
Why can't you?

649
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,090
Just trust me this once.

650
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,000
How can I trust you? I can't.

651
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,670
I'll be your precious husband. From now on, do as I say.

652
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,970
Da Hae.

653
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,830
Don't ask for money. I'm not the person you should come to.

654
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,210
Money?

655
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,200
I promise I'll pay you back.

656
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,940
We should get a place to stay.

657
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,770
I'll try.

658
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,600
What is this?

659
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,170
I sent her that, but she refused to take it and sent it back.

660
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,970
Okay.

661
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,670
Hello?

662
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,200
- Don't send things like that.
 -  It's nothing big.

663
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,070
- It's just some meat.
 -  I don't need it.

664
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,570
You don't have to send me food. I'm eating just fine.

665
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,900
I missed my grandchildren, but I tried not to.

666
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,570
I'll have to reconsider things.

667
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,070
They're my grandchildren. Why should I try not to miss them?

668
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,530
I'm hanging up now.

669
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,670
Cho Rong, Da Rong.

670
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,900
You're home.

671
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,600
You should do it on a side. Why do you have to do it here?

672
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,770
You're here.

673
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,630
Make him do it on a side.

674
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,830
Play here.

675
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,300
It hurts when people step on them.

676
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,470
Aren't kids home?

677
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,830
They are. They must be playing with their smartphones.

678
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,200
It's not good to play with it for a long time, but they won't listen.

679
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,400
What are you doing?

680
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,500
Why won't you greet me at the door?

681
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,940
Cho Rong.

682
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,910
- Dad.
 -  I heard you always play with this.

683
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll take it away for a while.

684
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,700
I don't always play with it. It was only two hours.

685
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,940
Da Rong, let's go.

686
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,150
What's the matter with you? Do you want me to scold you?

687
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,470
Dad, you know what?

688
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,270
- You feel like a stepfather to us.
 -  She's right. You're different.

689
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,900
What did you want to say?

690
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,770
Nothing. I'll tell you later.

691
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,500
You told me to come home early because you have something to say.

692
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,830
I'll tell you later.

693
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Jae Soon.

694
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,770
I want you to stop lying to me.

695
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,500
I lied to you?

696
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,770
Cho Rong says she plays with her phone for only two hours.

697
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,600
- That's...
 -  You lied about going to dry sauna.

698
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,300
- That's...
 -  I hate people lying to me.

699
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,440
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

700
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,170
How did you know I went to the dry sauna?

701
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,830
Did you see me?

702
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,730
Was it...

703
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,070
the credit card?

704
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,170
You might lose it, so I got the notification service.

705
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,400
I didn't do it to check where you spend the money on.

706
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,940
Don't mind it, and use it. As you always did.

707
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,370
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

708
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,630
Pick one.

709
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,400
That's not right.

710
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,030
Watch.

711
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,940
Walk to the hotel lobby.

712
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,090
Push the revolving door. Don't do it frivolously.

713
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,730
Watch the speed of the rotation,

714
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,630
and calculate the number of steps.

715
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,600
The girl is sitting over there.

716
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,130
Take off your sunglasses and run your fingers through your hair.

717
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,000
The girl will fall in love with you.

718
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,500
Sit across from her,

719
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,870
and throw your car key carelessly.

720
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,070
Act like you don't care about it.

721
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,330
Put down your cell phone naturally,

722
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,630
and say, "I'm sorry. My meeting ran late."

723
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,400
For the first time, look her in the eyes.

724
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,930
Okay?

725
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,700
You should look classy and natural when you do this.

726
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,870
Be natural.

727
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,100
Don't forget to be nonchalant.

728
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,170
You're sometimes too nice. That's not charming.

729
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,150
Also, when you move to another place...

730
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,030
It was such a long meeting.

731
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,030
Let's take your car.

732
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,430
Find a good timing when you pay.

733
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,730
I was in a hurry and I forgot to bring my wallet.

734
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,470
I can't call my secretary over this.

735
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,170
I'll buy you a nice meal next time.

736
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,770
Let's do a final check.

737
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,670
I'm sorry I'm late.

738
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,930
My meeting ran late.

739
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,700
To make it up to you,

740
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,540
let me settle the bills today.

741
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,310
No. I just got here.

742
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,530
Order something.

743
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,500
Let's go to somewhere else.

744
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,930
I'll go wash my hands first.

745
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,330
(Deposit: 45,000 dollars)

746
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,300
How many zeros is that?

747
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,940
10,000... Oh, my.

748
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,990
(Deposit: 32,000 dollars)

749
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,470
My gosh.

750
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,330
Grandpa is still asleep, right?

751
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,580
Go upstairs now.

752
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,270
You're driving me crazy.

753
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,470
If he finds out, both of us will...

754
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,340
You know that, right?

755
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,400
Mum, I'm sorry.

756
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,000
Se Gye. You're still awake.

757
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,210
You shouldn't stay out until so late.

758
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,930
I just had fun to relieve stress.

759
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,100
You're hardly at home when I come home from work.

760
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,600
You sneak out after your grandfather goes to sleep.

761
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,270
If you keep doing this, I'll have to tell him.

762
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,120
What do you want me to do?

763
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,790
I have to relieve stress.

764
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,360
What stresses you?

765
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,090
This is what stresses me out.

766
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,930
You don't let me do what I want.

767
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,000
Be quiet.

768
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Ms Yeo.

769
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,220
Do you want my father to wake up and kick us out?

770
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,270
What's the matter?

771
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,990
I told her not to stay out until late.

772
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,470
Gong Joo is only 24 years old.

773
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,050
It must stress her out that she got married so young.

774
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,870
All her friends are still students.

775
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,070
Let her have fun.

776
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,600
Stop crying and come out.

777
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,870
You're old enough. Why can't you soothe a young girl?

778
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,800
Here is 1,000 dollars.

779
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,700
I knew it. You saved up some money.

780
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,220
I saved it up for an emergency.

781
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,170
This is an emergency.

782
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,630
1,000 dollars for deposit and 100 dollars for monthly rent?

783
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,020
Even a small room that only 1 person can fit is 200 dollars.

784
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,100
I can pitch in 100 dollars per month.

785
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,190
Please find a place that rents for 200.

786
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,570
We can get a good place, right?

787
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,390
A good place?

788
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,470
It'd be better if it has big windows,

789
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,790
gets a lot of sun and faces south.

790
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:25,970
I don't want a basement.

791
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,330
Right. It must have mould.

792
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,890
Water should come out well and drain well.

793
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,490
Thieves mustn't easily come in.

794
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:33,130
It should be close to bus stops and subway station.

795
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,290
It should be three minutes' walk.

796
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,490
Shouldn't the kitchen be separated from the room?

797
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,230
Of course. Otherwise, the room will smell bad.

798
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,830
We will cook fish and pork.

799
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,960
The room should be big.

800
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,330
The kitchen should be big.

801
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,450
I want built-in furniture like a desk and a bed.

802
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,190
It'd be better if it has a sink, a cooking table and a fridge.

803
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,330
Right. Built-in furniture.

804
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,400
Also, it should be clean.

805
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,400
It shouldn't have cockroaches or mould.

806
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,990
It shouldn't leak rain, and it must have clean wallpaper.

807
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,170
If it's a new apartment, we'll sign the paper today.

808
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:07,500
The place you just mentioned...

809
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,600
is at least 1,000 dollars per month.

810
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,670
Let's be realistic.

811
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,270
You don't need a bathroom, right?

812
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,260
Water would stop running once in a while.

813
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,050
You should heat up the water yourselves.

814
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,520
They have built-in furniture, but it won't be clean.

815
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,700
Even if it is, the room won't be vacant for long.

816
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,570
Are you newly-weds?

817
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,430
When is your wedding?

818
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:28,870
We haven't set the date yet.

819
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,290
If you register your marriage, you can get loans.

820
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,400
- We can't do that.
 -  We can't do that.

821
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,930
Are you just going to live together?

822
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,520
You should get married first,

823
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,140
register your marriage and then live together.

824
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,400
Young people always want to live together first. You'll regret it.

825
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,070
Look, young lady.

826
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,740
What if you live together,

827
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,020
he gets tired of you and leaves you?

828
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,630
What kind of person do you think I am?

829
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,490
I'm not like that.

830
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,670
You never know what will happen.

831
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,400
I'm saying this because you're my daughter's age.

832
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,100
Think again carefully.

833
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,100
Let's go to another place.

834
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,030
Take a look.

835
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,600
Gab Soon.

836
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,730
What is it?

837
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,070
(My friends forever)

838
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,330
(This is my lovely house. Visit me soon!)

839
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,500
Why are you looking at this?

840
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,730
They're the enemies of this country. They give you sense of deprivation.

841
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,970
They just want to feel superior.

842
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,830
I hope they get struck by lightening.

843
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,970
This would make Gab Soon upset.

844
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:48,170
Aren't you hungry?

845
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,230
Let's go and eat.

846
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:56,780
What do you want to eat?

847
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,060
Gimbap? Tteokbokki, too?

848
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,100
I'll pay.

849
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,130
(Prime Rib)

850
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,130
Hey, Gab Soon! This isn't right!

851
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:10,010
- This isn't right.
 -  Why not?

852
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,700
This will cost us a month's rent.

853
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,700
So?

854
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,120
Five servings of beef ribs, please.

855
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,770
No. Just one serving, please.

856
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,020
You can't order one serving.

857
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,760
You should order at least two servings.

858
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,600
Then just two servings, please.

859
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,230
You can eat it all. I won't even smell it.

860
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,500
Just give us five servings.

861
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,100
What now?

862
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,710
You were eating just fine.

863
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,980
People are looking.

864
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,510
So what?

865
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,070
- Miss.
 -  I'm so sorry.

866
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,060
Let's go to the restroom.

867
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,840
Go by yourself.

868
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,120
This is my seat.

869
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,100
This is my seat until I finish my meal.

870
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,830
Who can say anything to me?

871
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,790
I don't have any place I can stay, but this is my seat.

872
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,790
We have other customers. You shouldn't do this here.

873
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,840
She says you shouldn't do this here.

874
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,900
Let's go out.

875
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,520
Let's talk outside.

876
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,970
You're acting like a drunken person.

877
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,180
Let me go.

878
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,530
I have nothing to say to you.

879
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,370
I can't stand this squalid life with you any more.

880
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,940
Go. I said go!

881
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,930
Bring me more lettuce.

882
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,730
You will have a hoarse throat. Stop crying.

883
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,230
I'll get a place no matter what.

884
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:08,900
Don't cry.

885
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,800
It's not good for our baby.

886
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,570
You have a hoarse throat.

887
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,700
Cho Rong.

888
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,730
This is mine.

889
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,390
- Just for today.
 -  That's the newest one I have.

890
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,170
I have a business meeting today.

891
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,460
You won't be taking off your pants.

892
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,730
A gentleman should always be prepared.

893
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,730
Goodness. I can't believe you're my son.

894
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,200
What is it?

895
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,530
Gosh.

896
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,330
Is someone in there?

897
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,000
A resident of the main building.

898
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,370
It's urgent.

899
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,870
It's urgent for me, too.

900
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,600
Please, hurry.

901
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,470
Let me give you a piece of advice.

902
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,940
Don't talk to me while I'm taking a shower.

903
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,940
Excuse me. Can I close my eyes and use the restroom?

904
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,530
I promise I won't look.

905
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:48,870
Use the public bathroom down the hill.

906
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,330
I paid the toilet fee!

907
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,200
I can't go as far as the public bathroom.

908
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,370
We live under the same roof so we should say hi to each other.

909
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,730
What are you saying?

910
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:18,170
Return my toilet fee.

911
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,770
Welcome.

912
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,400
Hello.

913
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,330
- Go on.
 -  Come in.

914
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:37,870
Hello, we're here to light up the mood.

915
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,730
Let's enjoy our time, guys!

916
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,070
Hey, let's pair up first.

917
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:49,670
Guys, we'll pick you today.

918
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,630
- That sounds good. Pick me.
 -  Pick me.

919
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,770
I choose...

920
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,830
him right there.

921
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,330
Don't mess with him. He's mine.

922
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,700
I choose him, then.

923
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,300
- I choose him.
 -  Come over.

924
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,300
Excellent!

925
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,380
Say it again.

926
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,900
I'm quitting. I can't do this any more.

927
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,540
You're funny.

928
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,370
You walked in here voluntarily but you can't just walk out.

929
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,700
You! I'm not letting go of you until you pay off your debt.

930
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,870
It's hot. Don't touch it.

931
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,400
Mum, can you lend me some money?

932
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,500
You lunatic. I don't have a penny for myself.

933
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:24,470
Can you lend me just 5,000 dollars?

934
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,930
You must be joking.

935
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,430
I'll pay you off right away.

936
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,700
Get your act together. Aren't you embarrassed to face your children?

937
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,120
Why are you talking about them?

938
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,770
You know I hate talking about them.

939
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:37,900
Act like a mum.

940
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,970
You have no reason to be in debt.

941
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,110
I never raised you guys like that.

942
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:44,970
I fed you, clothed you and sent you to school all on my own.

943
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,700
- But you...
 -  Forget it!

944
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,170
Geum Sik got remarried.

945
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:54,270
Whether he gets remarried or not doesn't have anything to do with me.

946
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,530
Let me give you a piece of advice.

947
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,570
Don't ever speak of him again.

948
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:24,230
(Karaoke)

949
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,070
My goodness.

950
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,230
One tiger swallowtail

951
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:06,470
Landed in a flower field

952
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,970
Not one person

953
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:16,700
Was there to look at it

954
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:21,170
Fly, tiger swallowtail

955
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,670
Fly, tiger swallowtail

956
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,870
Above the sky

957
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,070
You can't slip so I'll go on my own.

958
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:01,370
Would you be okay? You have the deposit on you, right?

959
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,800
I do.

960
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,830
- Be careful.
 -  Don't worry, Your Highness.

961
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,330
That's the restroom.

962
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:24,870
Look around.

963
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,430
It's vacant so we can move in right away. What do you think?

964
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,570
Don't sign the contract, yet.

965
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:41,400
Let's go back tomorrow.

966
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:05,530
This station is Oksu Station.

967
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,770
The door is on your right.

968
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,330
Excuse me. I'm getting off. Give me a second.

969
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,130
(Our Gab Soon)

970
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,520
How are you going to take responsibility?

971
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,120
Forget the baby. I'm sick of everything.

972
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,310
I won't have it.

973
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,890
Gab Soon is roaming about in Seoul.

974
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:06,100
Do you keep seeing things?

975
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,490
Take her to the hospital. She must've gone out of her mind.

976
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,230
Where is Ddol Ee? Ddol Ee!

977
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,890
Mum.

978
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,020
You've been doing well since school. Hang in there.

979
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,030
Hey.

980
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:16,650
I'm sorry.

981
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,190
She's not fit for our family.

982
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,420
She's the only one who didn't try to flatter me.

983
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,430
I have a good feeling.

984
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,460
How could you be so annoying every time?

985
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,260
Live properly.

986
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,520
I told you not to come!

987
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,740
I don't need a mum.

988
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,350
Don't lose it.

989
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:31,920
I'll protect it with my life.

990
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,120
Is he not here yet? He must have run away.

991
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,570
He would never do that.
