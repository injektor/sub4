<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

4
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:12,538
<font color="yellow">Is the result out?</font>

<font color="yellow">What is it? Did you fail?</font>

8
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:38,638
<font color="yellow">Mum. Thank you.</font>

9
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,168

16
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:01,878
<font color="yellow">How could this happen? You brat.</font>

17
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:04,008
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

18
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,868
<font color="yellow">You did a great job. You really did.</font>

19
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:21,068
<font color="yellow">It's all good now. All the hard time is over now.</font>

00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,608
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Oh, dear.</font>

24
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:38,538
<font color="yellow">Why are you in such a hurry?</font>

25
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:40,668
<font color="yellow">Do you want to eat meat that badly?</font>

26
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:42,538
<font color="yellow">Tell me about it.</font>

27
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:45,408
<font color="yellow">We just got nice and cheap pork.</font>

28
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:49,238
<font color="yellow">I don't want cheap pork. Give me the finest rib eye you have.</font>

29
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:51,768
<font color="yellow">If you have something better, that'd be good, too.</font>

30
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:52,938
<font color="yellow">Rib eye?</font>

31
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:56,068
<font color="yellow">You don't even eat pork that often.</font>

32
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:59,708
<font color="yellow">I would buy enough beef for the whole neighbourhood if I could.</font>

33
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:02,608
<font color="yellow">My dear Gab Dol passed his exam.</font>

34
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:06,308
<font color="yellow">My goodness. He finally did it.</font>

35
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,368
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy for you.</font>

36
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:12,938
<font color="yellow">You've been working so hard to raise your children without a husband.</font>

37
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,008
<font color="yellow">It finally pays off.</font>

38
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:18,308
<font color="yellow">You should eat anything you want to eat from now on,</font>

39
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,938
<font color="yellow">and get your knee treated.</font>

40
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:23,008
<font color="yellow">After I found out Gab Dol passed,</font>

41
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:26,208
<font color="yellow">I ran all the way here without feeling any pain in my knee.</font>

42
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,508
<font color="yellow">I guess this is what you raise your kids for.</font>

43
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:30,668
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

46
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,668
<font color="yellow">Does everyone get free dumplings?</font>

47
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:43,038
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol passed his exam.</font>

48
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:46,768
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol's mum is here to buy rib eye because he passed.</font>

49
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:50,368
<font color="yellow">It's not like he became a minister. It's just a public official.</font>

50
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:51,468
<font color="yellow">Just a public official?</font>

51
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:53,508
<font color="yellow">He should get a good scolding.</font>

52
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,068
<font color="yellow">You should go and ask Gab Dol to teach you.</font>

53
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:59,738
<font color="yellow">You said it's only a part-time job. Are you going to do that forever?</font>

54
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,508
<font color="yellow">You've been a delivery man for years now.</font>

55
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:04,038
<font color="yellow">When is the last time you studied?</font>

56
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:06,468
<font color="yellow">Quit your job and study!</font>

57
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:07,838
<font color="yellow">I already quit studying.</font>

58
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,968
<font color="yellow">That brat.</font>

59
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:11,838
<font color="yellow">- Just give me the rib eye. - Okay.</font>

60
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:19,638
<font color="yellow">You said you'd propose to me with 100 roses on the day you pass.</font>

61
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,808
<font color="yellow">Keep your word like a man.</font>

62
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,568
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

63
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:31,238
<font color="yellow">How much are 100 roses?</font>

64
00:03:31,238 --> 00:03:32,508
<font color="yellow">- 100 roses? - Yes.</font>

65
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:33,608
<font color="yellow">Is it going to be a present?</font>

66
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:41,038
<font color="yellow">It's a newly opened gym. You can get a discount with this.</font>

67
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,668
<font color="yellow">It's a newly opened gym. You can get...</font>

68
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,708
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Don't greet me.</font>

69
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:53,108
<font color="yellow">You said you'd become a teacher. Do you give out flyers now?</font>

70
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,668
<font color="yellow">Don't come near my house ever again.</font>

71
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,708
<font color="yellow">My son passed his exam after he broke up with you.</font>

72
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:02,138
<font color="yellow">Really? Did Gab Dol pass?</font>

73
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:04,308
<font color="yellow">Why does that make you happy?</font>

74
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:06,568
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol and you are on different paths now.</font>

75
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,438
<font color="yellow">Don't even greet him on streets.</font>

76
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:11,938
<font color="yellow">If it makes an unsavoury rumour, it'll be a problem for his marriage.</font>

77
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:14,638
<font color="yellow">Why don't you move?</font>

78
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,738
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live in the same neighbourhood as you.</font>

79
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:18,578
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

80
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,438
<font color="yellow">Let me go. I said let me go!</font>

85
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,568
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations. - Are you going to get married?</font>

86
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,508
<font color="yellow">Your friends are making a big fuss, right? Are they jealous?</font>

87
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:48,538
<font color="yellow">Eat first. Your sister will eat it all.</font>

88
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,538
<font color="yellow">I haven't even eaten any.</font>

89
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,008
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol. You finally hit a home run.</font>

90
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:56,168
<font color="yellow">It's not just a home run.</font>

91
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,038
<font color="yellow">It's like passing a state exam.</font>

92
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,908
<font color="yellow">In the old days, he'd be a royal inspector.</font>

93
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:03,608
<font color="yellow">Go on and eat. Eat before Da Hae eats it all.</font>

94
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:06,308
<font color="yellow">You're mean like a stepmother.</font>

95
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:09,738
<font color="yellow">I even saved your name as "stepmother" in my phone.</font>

96
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,368
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

97
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:15,868
<font color="yellow">Thank you for being a good son.</font>

98
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,208
<font color="yellow">Look how happy Mum is.</font>

99
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:21,668
<font color="yellow">I told you. You're like the pillar of our family.</font>

100
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:23,508
<font color="yellow">You saved us.</font>

101
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,238
<font color="yellow">Of course he did.</font>

102
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,338
<font color="yellow">I knew a day like this would come.</font>

103
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:34,138
<font color="yellow">If your father was alive, he would be so happy.</font>

104
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:40,138
<font color="yellow">We should pay him a visit later.</font>

105
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:44,608
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying on a happy day like this?</font>

106
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,608
<font color="yellow">Hey. Give her a piggyback ride.</font>

107
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:50,838
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

108
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:55,108
<font color="yellow">- Get on. - You'll hurt your back.</font>

109
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:58,708
<font color="yellow">Go on. If he gets married, he will have to carry his mother-in-law.</font>

110
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:00,008
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

111
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:04,608
<font color="yellow">Right. I should get on his back while I can.</font>

112
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:09,608
<font color="yellow">You're strong.</font>

113
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,408
<font color="yellow">- Are you happy? - Of course, I am.</font>

114
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,938
<font color="yellow">I can't believe such a great thing happened in my life.</font>

115
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,138
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

116
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,308
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

117
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:36,208
<font color="yellow">Let me down. You may hurt your back.</font>

118
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,608
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing? Take me back.</font>

119
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:46,808
<font color="yellow">Why do you see him when you have to hear that?</font>

120
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:48,938
<font color="yellow">I'm showing the bottom of myself to you.</font>

121
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,638
<font color="yellow">I'm not even ashamed because you've seen so many terrible things.</font>

122
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,238
<font color="yellow">Just don't be with him, then.</font>

123
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:59,208
<font color="yellow">Do you know love requires loyalty, too?</font>

124
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:00,568
<font color="yellow">I don't know that.</font>

125
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:02,238
<font color="yellow">Although I don't know,</font>

126
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,608
<font color="yellow">I just know that one should not let his mum...</font>

127
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:07,908
<font color="yellow">say something horrible like that to his girlfriend.</font>

128
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:09,938
<font color="yellow">If you're his girl,</font>

129
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:14,708
<font color="yellow">he should not let you hear those words.</font>

130
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:19,668
<font color="yellow">A woman's love lies in the time she spent together.</font>

131
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:21,538
<font color="yellow">That's how women are.</font>

132
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,238
<font color="yellow">Though you dated a guy for 10 years, you can fall in love just in a day.</font>

133
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,108
<font color="yellow">Please go out with me.</font>

134
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:33,038
<font color="yellow">You're so sweet.</font>

135
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:35,108
<font color="yellow">I want to be swayed.</font>

136
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:36,968
<font color="yellow">Then, be swayed.</font>

137
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,008
<font color="yellow">No, I won't.</font>

138
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:41,868
<font color="yellow">I know you don't belong to me no matter how sweet you are.</font>

139
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,008
<font color="yellow">I'm not too young to believe what you say.</font>

140
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,038
<font color="yellow">I'm almost 30 years old now.</font>

141
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,568
<font color="yellow">If you're tired of your toy, you're going to leave, aren't you?</font>

142
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:54,508
<font color="yellow">I thought you were smart but I don't think you really are.</font>

143
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,238
<font color="yellow">I already have a lot of toys.</font>

144
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:02,608
<font color="yellow">I don't need to play with you.</font>

145
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,608
<font color="yellow">I must be a different toy.</font>

146
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:09,338
<font color="yellow">A strange toy that you've never seen so far.</font>

147
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,968
<font color="yellow">Give me a ride. Otherwise, I'll take a bus.</font>

148
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,138
<font color="yellow">Stay there.</font>

149
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,838
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, block me. I'll play offense.</font>

150
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:22,738
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

151
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,178
<font color="yellow">- Take it. - I will.</font>

152
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,408
<font color="yellow">Take the ball from me.</font>

153
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:27,508
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

154
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,008
<font color="yellow">I scored.</font>

155
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:32,068
<font color="yellow">- You play offense now. - Offense.</font>

156
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,178
<font color="yellow">Try to score.</font>

157
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:43,768
<font color="yellow">You played very well.</font>

158
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,968
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo, please take this.</font>

159
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,038
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

160
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:54,608
<font color="yellow">If it's not about our children, don't talk to me.</font>

161
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:57,538
<font color="yellow">What did you want to say when you asked me to come out?</font>

162
00:09:58,308 --> 00:09:59,308
<font color="yellow">I'll talk later.</font>

163
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:00,738
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

164
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,938
<font color="yellow">Is it about money? Did you make trouble?</font>

165
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:08,338
<font color="yellow">What do you have to say outside the house?</font>

166
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:10,268
<font color="yellow">It's not something like that. Don't worry.</font>

167
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:11,678
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about it later.</font>

168
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:14,038
<font color="yellow">You ask me to come out only when you make a trouble.</font>

169
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:16,338
<font color="yellow">Just like when you lost your retirement pay.</font>

170
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,908
<font color="yellow">Is it something about our house?</font>

171
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,768
<font color="yellow">If you do something with this house, you'll be dead.</font>

172
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,008
<font color="yellow">How are you doing?</font>

173
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:40,678
<font color="yellow">Is your family doing okay since you don't have Ddol Ee?</font>

174
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:42,438
<font color="yellow">You'll be punished.</font>

175
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,308
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

176
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:47,438
<font color="yellow">- Where is Mum? - She is sick in bed.</font>

177
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:51,738
<font color="yellow">We're getting sick since we have to play with Ddol Ee.</font>

178
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,838
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee doesn't have time to put his feet on the ground.</font>

179
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,338
<font color="yellow">Everyone takes turns to hold him and to give him a piggy back ride.</font>

180
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,468
<font color="yellow">He's enjoying a wonderful life.</font>

181
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:01,738
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

182
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:04,668
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

183
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:09,168
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with other kids. But I get so upset...</font>

184
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,738
<font color="yellow">when you say something like that.</font>

185
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,138
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

186
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,608
<font color="yellow">Did you come to let out your anger again?</font>

187
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,468
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

188
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:21,868
<font color="yellow">You must have let it out to your own mum since you were suffering a lot.</font>

189
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,108
<font color="yellow">Speak frankly.</font>

190
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:27,238
<font color="yellow">When did I mistreat you?</font>

191
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:30,568
<font color="yellow">Did I mistreat you and make you feel uncomfortable because you were here?</font>

192
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,938
<font color="yellow">Frankly, you did a little bit.</font>

193
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:36,608
<font color="yellow">I felt uncomfortable while eating, too.</font>

194
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:39,108
<font color="yellow">When I took out some fruits, you said...</font>

195
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:41,268
<font color="yellow">"The fridge gets empty as soon as I fill it."</font>

196
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:42,668
<font color="yellow">And when Ddol Ee cried, you said...</font>

197
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,538
<font color="yellow">"Why do you make him cry? It'll drive good luck away."</font>

198
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:47,968
<font color="yellow">It's no use to be nice to daughters.</font>

199
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:50,368
<font color="yellow">You guys are happy only when I treat you well.</font>

200
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,868
<font color="yellow">I was upset back then but now, I understand how you'd feel.</font>

201
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:59,308
<font color="yellow">When I got divorced and came back with my child,</font>

202
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:03,968
<font color="yellow">you must have felt ashamed to your friends and had a hard time.</font>

203
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:05,838
<font color="yellow">It was as if the whole world collapsed.</font>

204
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:08,368
<font color="yellow">I thought, "What did I do wrong to experience this?"</font>

205
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,538
<font color="yellow">"She must be suffering more with her child."</font>

206
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,368
<font color="yellow">I was hopeless.</font>

207
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,438
<font color="yellow">You'll never understand how miserable I was.</font>

208
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,238
<font color="yellow">What did Geum Sik say about Ddol Ee staying here?</font>

209
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,208
<font color="yellow">He told me to bring him back right away.</font>

210
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,808
<font color="yellow">He said so even though he doesn't mean it.</font>

211
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:27,108
<font color="yellow">He must've thought a lot about this.</font>

212
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,738
<font color="yellow">I also have a lot to fix.</font>

213
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:34,268
<font color="yellow">I tried to think of the girls as my own children, but it wasn't easy.</font>

214
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:38,008
<font color="yellow">If they were mean, I got annoyed and hated them.</font>

215
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,668
<font color="yellow">I had doubts about living like that.</font>

216
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:45,068
<font color="yellow">Your own children get hateful often.</font>

217
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:46,968
<font color="yellow">If they're not your own, it's even worse.</font>

218
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:51,338
<font color="yellow">You can hang in there because it's you.</font>

219
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:52,568
<font color="yellow">Moreover,</font>

220
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:55,038
<font color="yellow">the girls are extremely difficult to deal with.</font>

221
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:58,238
<font color="yellow">Above all, their mum is the problem.</font>

222
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:00,208
<font color="yellow">She was divorced because of her fault, wasn't she?</font>

223
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,668
<font color="yellow">Since she has nowhere to go...</font>

224
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:04,708
<font color="yellow">and Geum Sik has a lot of money,</font>

225
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,738
<font color="yellow">she must be wanting to come back with the help of her kids.</font>

226
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,738
<font color="yellow">Watch out for her.</font>

227
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,038
<font color="yellow">- We're back. - Ddol Ee must be back.</font>

228
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:16,008
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

229
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,938
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - My dear child.</font>

230
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,868
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good time?</font>

231
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:26,008
<font color="yellow">You're tanned.</font>

232
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:28,038
<font color="yellow">I played basketball with Uncle.</font>

233
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,608
<font color="yellow">He had so much fun.</font>

234
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,938
<font color="yellow">He was very good at basketball. He could make a professional player.</font>

235
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,608
<font color="yellow">Are you a good basketball player?</font>

236
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:36,638
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, did you have a great time?</font>

237
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:38,908
<font color="yellow">Where is Gong Joo?</font>

238
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:40,768
<font color="yellow">She went home to wash up.</font>

239
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,268
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo said she called you yesterday.</font>

240
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,808
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Tell her never to call me.</font>

241
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:48,768
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

242
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,668
<font color="yellow">Does she trade stocks?</font>

243
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,108
<font color="yellow">Stocks? No.</font>

244
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,168
<font color="yellow">All of a sudden, she talked about some DAQ...</font>

245
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,138
<font color="yellow">and a lot of thing regarding stocks.</font>

246
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:02,668
<font color="yellow">I had a hard time listening to all the words I don't understand.</font>

247
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:06,008
<font color="yellow">She must have read newspaper because she didn't have anything to say.</font>

248
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:07,908
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

249
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:09,508
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

250
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:13,438
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof.</font>

251
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,708
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

252
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,008
<font color="yellow">Hey, Shin Mal Nyeon.</font>

253
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:23,168
<font color="yellow">I didn't teach him. He learned on his own.</font>

254
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,138
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is a genius.</font>

255
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,038
<font color="yellow">I'll get going, Mum.</font>

256
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,168
<font color="yellow">Can we talk for a minute?</font>

257
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:44,938
<font color="yellow">There is nothing special.</font>

258
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,068
<font color="yellow">Didn't he say anything when you went to Sokcho?</font>

259
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:50,168
<font color="yellow">Like he made trouble or something.</font>

260
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,508
<font color="yellow">- No, he didn't. - Then, what's wrong?</font>

261
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,638
<font color="yellow">I think there is something for sure...</font>

262
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,308
<font color="yellow">but he doesn't tell me.</font>

263
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,568
<font color="yellow">He doesn't talk to me.</font>

264
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,108
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's going on as he gets older.</font>

265
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,638
<font color="yellow">He gets upset easily and cries a lot.</font>

266
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,968
<font color="yellow">He used to be annoyed when I cried,</font>

267
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:11,708
<font color="yellow">but he's the one who cries everyday now.</font>

268
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,908
<font color="yellow">He also gets teary while watching a TV show.</font>

269
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:15,638
<font color="yellow">Men change like that as they get older.</font>

270
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:18,008
<font color="yellow">It's a fact medically proven.</font>

271
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,838
<font color="yellow">Other men look still young at the age of 63.</font>

272
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,308
<font color="yellow">He's the only one who's like that.</font>

273
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:25,538
<font color="yellow">People don't believe that we're of the same age.</font>

274
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,138
<font color="yellow">That's because you look so young and pretty.</font>

275
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:30,338
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

276
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:33,168
<font color="yellow">Some think I'm in my early 50s.</font>

277
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:38,008
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

278
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,608
<font color="yellow">Dad is severely sick.</font>

279
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,538
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

280
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,268
<font color="yellow">His heart.</font>

281
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,068
<font color="yellow">Who is not?</font>

282
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,268
<font color="yellow">All my body and heart are sick.</font>

283
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,208
<font color="yellow">I'm like a general hospital.</font>

284
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,068
<font color="yellow">Think of Dad as a patient.</font>

285
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,638
<font color="yellow">I'm a patient, too.</font>

286
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:57,568
<font color="yellow">I wish I could stay in your hospital for a few months.</font>

287
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,438
<font color="yellow">In my opinion as a doctor, you're healthy.</font>

288
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:04,608
<font color="yellow">You talk about your feelings and have friends to meet.</font>

289
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,968
<font color="yellow">Since you've taken good care of your heart, you're okay.</font>

290
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,208
<font color="yellow">But Dad has never done that before.</font>

291
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:12,038
<font color="yellow">Please understand Dad.</font>

292
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,908
<font color="yellow">You've been living with him for 40 years.</font>

293
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:16,938
<font color="yellow">Nobody asked him to live like that.</font>

294
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:20,468
<font color="yellow">He stays at home all the time after he retired.</font>

295
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:23,968
<font color="yellow">He said he didn't meet his friends because he didn't have enough money.</font>

296
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:26,168
<font color="yellow">He wanted to save money.</font>

297
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,108
<font color="yellow">You're having fun, too.</font>

298
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:36,938
<font color="yellow">I'm having more fun than Ddol Ee.</font>

299
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,908
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol has passed the test.</font>

300
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,538
<font color="yellow">Really? Has he really passed the test?</font>

301
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:46,938
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

302
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:48,308
<font color="yellow">He must have tried hard.</font>

303
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,908
<font color="yellow">After trying for about 10 years, he finally succeeded.</font>

304
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,508
<font color="yellow">Bring him over sometime.</font>

305
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:59,108
<font color="yellow">How can you change your attitude so easily?</font>

306
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:03,968
<font color="yellow">You used to tell her to dump him because he's unlucky.</font>

307
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:06,108
<font color="yellow">The situation has changed.</font>

308
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,968
<font color="yellow">Don't count your chickens before they're hatched.</font>

309
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,238
<font color="yellow">Their daughter-in-law has to be a teacher, right?</font>

310
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,338
<font color="yellow">Give him up already.</font>

311
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:17,668
<font color="yellow">If he finds another girl, you'll be miserable.</font>

312
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,338
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all. I sure have.</font>

313
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:22,738
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof.</font>

314
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:23,968
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

315
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:28,038
<font color="yellow">That's right. You know what I'm saying.</font>

316
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:42,768
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

317
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,538
<font color="yellow">Your son, Gab Dol, is here.</font>

318
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,408
<font color="yellow">I passed the civil service exam.</font>

319
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,138
<font color="yellow">I did a good job, right?</font>

320
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:58,908
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

321
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:02,708
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

322
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,668
<font color="yellow">I'll be a better son for Mum.</font>

323
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:11,138
<font color="yellow">I'll do better for you, too.</font>

324
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:15,538
<font color="yellow">Watch me how I'm doing.</font>

325
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,268
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best to live well.</font>

326
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,138
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dad.</font>

327
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,738
<font color="yellow">(Gab Soon)</font>

328
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,108
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, I passed...</font>

329
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:16,238
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Gab Dol.</font>

330
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,878
<font color="yellow">I thought you would tell me first.</font>

331
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,738
<font color="yellow">I heard it from your mum.</font>

332
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,468
<font color="yellow">Are you still mad at me?</font>

333
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:25,838
<font color="yellow">Let's not argue any more because of our family stuff.</font>

334
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:29,768
<font color="yellow">You know how hard we've been trying to keep our love.</font>

335
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,738
<font color="yellow">Come out. Let's celebrate with a drink.</font>

336
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:38,378
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like going out tonight.</font>

337
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,708
<font color="yellow">- It's me, Gab Soon. - Hi.</font>

338
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:51,168
<font color="yellow">Congratulations. I'm really happy for you.</font>

339
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:54,608
<font color="yellow">Your family and friends must be very happy, right?</font>

340
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:55,838
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

341
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:57,838
<font color="yellow">Can't you come out tonight?</font>

342
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,138
<font color="yellow">Can we meet up just for a while later?</font>

343
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:03,408
<font color="yellow">- Where are you right now? - I'm at home.</font>

344
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:05,538
<font color="yellow">Did you not work today?</font>

345
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,438
<font color="yellow">I came home from work a while ago. What time can we meet?</font>

346
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:12,968
<font color="yellow">I think I have an upset stomach from eating meat.</font>

347
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:15,268
<font color="yellow">You should've eaten slowly.</font>

348
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:19,378
<font color="yellow">I'm not feeling well right now. Let me call you back later.</font>

349
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:22,238
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's meet up later then.</font>

350
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,538
<font color="yellow">Call me back, okay?</font>

351
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:29,308
<font color="yellow">I don't think he has a feeling for you any more.</font>

352
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,938
<font color="yellow">Stop begging him for his love.</font>

353
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,968
<font color="yellow">You better make up your mind before you get dumped.</font>

354
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:40,378
<font color="yellow">Now that he passed the exam, he wouldn't care about you any more.</font>

355
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:44,378
<font color="yellow">If you devote yourself, you'll get abandoned like an old shoe.</font>

356
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,968
<font color="yellow">I've seen many girls getting dumped after they devote themselves to men.</font>

357
00:20:48,968 --> 00:20:51,878
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol wouldn't do that. You don't know anything about it.</font>

358
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:55,038
<font color="yellow">What do I not know?</font>

359
00:20:57,878 --> 00:20:59,568
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all. I sure have.</font>

360
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:04,608
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

361
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,838
<font color="yellow">My good boy.</font>

362
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:25,968
<font color="yellow">You're such a good son.</font>

363
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:29,668
<font color="yellow">I'm sure this is what children do for their parents.</font>

364
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:39,378
<font color="yellow">Honey, thank you...</font>

365
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:41,538
<font color="yellow">for grating my wish after all.</font>

366
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:45,308
<font color="yellow">Please bless him...</font>

367
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:48,608
<font color="yellow">and send him a good wife soon.</font>

368
00:21:57,468 --> 00:21:58,908
<font color="yellow">I'll call you back later.</font>

369
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,608
<font color="yellow">He's playing hard to get already.</font>

370
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:04,638
<font color="yellow">He passed the exam. Why would he want someone like you with no job?</font>

371
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:51,608
<font color="yellow">Like the whisky slopping</font>

372
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:55,638
<font color="yellow">In a glass</font>

373
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,638
<font color="yellow">You look so excited. Do you need a microphone or something?</font>

374
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:00,968
<font color="yellow">Do you think I would stop singing?</font>

375
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:03,408
<font color="yellow">I can even dance in front of the big crowd as well.</font>

376
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:06,808
<font color="yellow">I'm not jealous of you being rich at all today.</font>

377
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,438
<font color="yellow">Your son should know about it.</font>

378
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:13,538
<font color="yellow">He could pass the exam because of your great devotion.</font>

379
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:16,368
<font color="yellow">I just want him to live well and happily. That's all.</font>

380
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:17,908
<font color="yellow">That's not all.</font>

381
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:21,238
<font color="yellow">You may feel bad sometimes like other parents do.</font>

382
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:25,308
<font color="yellow">Take this and...</font>

383
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,808
<font color="yellow">buy your son a nice suit.</font>

384
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:30,938
<font color="yellow">I think he'll need a suit for work.</font>

385
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:36,368
<font color="yellow">Take it.</font>

386
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:39,508
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I can take this.</font>

387
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,738
<font color="yellow">I'd better listen to you while I'm working for you.</font>

388
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:48,108
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Sir. No, Mr Yeo.</font>

389
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,368
<font color="yellow">If he failed again,</font>

390
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:52,638
<font color="yellow">I was going to offer him a security job at my company.</font>

391
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:54,408
<font color="yellow">What do you take him for?</font>

392
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:57,268
<font color="yellow">He had studied for the bar exam before.</font>

393
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:59,708
<font color="yellow">If things had gone well,</font>

394
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:01,068
<font color="yellow">he would have become a judge or prosecutor. And what?</font>

395
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,568
<font color="yellow">I don't need it.</font>

396
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:07,968
<font color="yellow">Don't be so hard on me. You scared me.</font>

397
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,808
<font color="yellow">My bad. Please take it.</font>

398
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:16,708
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam.</font>

399
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,208
<font color="yellow">Why? What's the matter?</font>

400
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,708
<font color="yellow">Why don't you keep your voice down?</font>

401
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:23,038
<font color="yellow">People may think that you're the boss in this house.</font>

402
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:25,308
<font color="yellow">You always speak so loud.</font>

403
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:28,268
<font color="yellow">Dad, why do you stay in the kitchen so often these days?</font>

404
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:30,238
<font color="yellow">You never came around the kitchen before.</font>

405
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:31,908
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

406
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:35,968
<font color="yellow">What's up with your lips?</font>

407
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:37,908
<font color="yellow">What about it?</font>

408
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:40,538
<font color="yellow">I asked her, but why are you answering me?</font>

409
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,268
<font color="yellow">Her lips look too much. It's not like she works in the kitchen.</font>

410
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:45,838
<font color="yellow">Wipe it off right away.</font>

00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:53,508
<font color="yellow">I just want you to get back together with Geum Sik...</font>

457
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:56,138
<font color="yellow">and live happily with your kids.</font>

458
00:27:58,838 --> 00:27:59,868
<font color="yellow">Was she lying?</font>

459
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:01,538
<font color="yellow">She didn't marry a rich guy.</font>

460
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,168
<font color="yellow">She was putting on a show.</font>

461
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,038
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'm glad I listened to you.</font>

462
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:18,538
<font color="yellow">My nephew really liked it.</font>

463
00:28:20,138 --> 00:28:21,908
<font color="yellow">I'm never wrong, you know.</font>

464
00:28:23,808 --> 00:28:25,438
<font color="yellow">I follow your advice too much.</font>

465
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,268
<font color="yellow">I broke up following your advice.</font>

466
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:34,768
<font color="yellow">How can you joke about that?</font>

467
00:28:37,238 --> 00:28:38,238
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

468
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:48,368
<font color="yellow">So what did you do?</font>

469
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:50,568
<font color="yellow">We played basketball.</font>

470
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,468
<font color="yellow">I was having more fun than my nephew.</font>

471
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:56,268
<font color="yellow">It felt like my mind was being healed.</font>

472
00:28:56,638 --> 00:28:58,338
<font color="yellow">Playing with kids can heal you.</font>

473
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:02,768
<font color="yellow">Won't you have kids?</font>

474
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:06,808
<font color="yellow">Isn't it about time to have one?</font>

475
00:29:11,238 --> 00:29:12,268
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

476
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:17,368
<font color="yellow">Let's go to your room. It's time for a check up.</font>

477
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:19,208
<font color="yellow">I'm totally fine.</font>

478
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,808
<font color="yellow">Your patient is over there. Go check.</font>

479
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,968
<font color="yellow">I felt like my blood pressure was rising.</font>

480
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:28,368
<font color="yellow">Don't get worked up.</font>

481
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:32,568
<font color="yellow">Mum hasn't had anything to eat all day.</font>

482
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:33,808
<font color="yellow">Does your stomach hurt?</font>

483
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:37,538
<font color="yellow">Her stomach is fine. She just doesn't have any appetite.</font>

484
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:39,738
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get an IV?</font>

485
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:41,268
<font color="yellow">Mum hates needles.</font>

486
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:42,508
<font color="yellow">Leave me.</font>

487
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:50,408
<font color="yellow">She never starved like that before.</font>

488
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,268
<font color="yellow">Did you read news articles to my mum?</font>

489
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:54,438
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

490
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:57,368
<font color="yellow">- I did. - Did you thought she'd get angry...</font>

491
00:29:57,668 --> 00:29:59,808
<font color="yellow">and say "Don't call again."</font>

492
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:02,638
<font color="yellow">- Did your mum tell you to do that? - Yes.</font>

493
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,238
<font color="yellow">I'm scared of Mother.</font>

494
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,938
<font color="yellow">My mother isn't scary. She's really nice.</font>

495
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:12,668
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo.</font>

496
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:16,968
<font color="yellow">I want you to be nice to my mother, like you want me to be nice...</font>

497
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,268
<font color="yellow">to your mother and grandpa.</font>

498
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:21,768
<font color="yellow">You don't need to call her if you don't want to.</font>

499
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:24,108
<font color="yellow">What about the sticker?</font>

500
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:25,708
<font color="yellow">Call her if you want a sticker.</font>

501
00:30:27,238 --> 00:30:28,708
<font color="yellow">Call her when you want to.</font>

502
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,838
<font color="yellow">But no more newspapers.</font>

503
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:32,338
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

504
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:36,738
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be nice if we had a baby?</font>

505
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:49,808
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

506
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:51,668
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

507
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:56,938
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

508
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:58,668
<font color="yellow">I just don't have any appetite.</font>

509
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,268
<font color="yellow">I have no strength because I'm starved.</font>

510
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:03,668
<font color="yellow">You'll lose all the weight you gained.</font>

511
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:06,638
<font color="yellow">Don't think anything stupid.</font>

512
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:10,938
<font color="yellow">I've observed him for over a year. He's a good guy.</font>

513
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,608
<font color="yellow">He has no other interests.</font>

514
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:14,368
<font color="yellow">You don't know that.</font>

515
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,808
<font color="yellow">I won't pass it on to him right away. I'm not that easy.</font>

516
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:21,038
<font color="yellow">He's your son-in-law. Think of him as your son.</font>

517
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,968
<font color="yellow">That's how he'll become your family. Will you leave Gong Joo on her own?</font>

518
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,568
<font color="yellow">She has me.</font>

519
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:28,968
<font color="yellow">I have a long life ahead of me. I don't need to rely on him.</font>

520
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:41,268
<font color="yellow">It's me. Are you looking into it?</font>

521
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:44,638
<font color="yellow">I know it's difficult, but you have to find it...</font>

522
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:46,008
<font color="yellow">as fast as possible.</font>

523
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:49,008
<font color="yellow">I'll pay any price if you find it.</font>

524
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,468
<font color="yellow">You can't think of it as just an absence.</font>

525
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:57,408
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong is sending a sign that she's having a hard time.</font>

526
00:31:57,538 --> 00:31:58,938
<font color="yellow">A sign?</font>

527
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,808
<font color="yellow">She might end up running away from home, right?</font>

528
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:03,538
<font color="yellow">Some kids do that.</font>

529
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:05,938
<font color="yellow">I told you. This is a start.</font>

530
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:09,438
<font color="yellow">You have to pay closer attention because she's an adolescent.</font>

531
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:11,438
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

532
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,108
<font color="yellow">kids with divorced parents go through a tough time.</font>

533
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:17,468
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong was mad at us for that.</font>

534
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:19,268
<font color="yellow">Give her more love...</font>

535
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,138
<font color="yellow">and don't let her see you two fight.</font>

536
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:23,368
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

537
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:26,438
<font color="yellow">She remembered us fighting when she was little.</font>

538
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:29,708
<font color="yellow">We bought her toys whenever she saw us fight.</font>

539
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,538
<font color="yellow">She remembered that, too.</font>

540
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:35,238
<font color="yellow">What shall we do now?</font>

541
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,308
<font color="yellow">When parents get a divorce, kids resent them...</font>

542
00:32:38,408 --> 00:32:41,808
<font color="yellow">or feel guilty thinking it was their fault.</font>

543
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:45,738
<font color="yellow">It sounded like her relationship with her step mum wasn't great.</font>

544
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,868
<font color="yellow">You will have to solve this problem wisely.</font>

545
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:53,338
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

546
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,408
<font color="yellow">It's all because of her step mum.</font>

547
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,538
<font color="yellow">How can you interpret it that way?</font>

548
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,538
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to rush?</font>

549
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:04,008
<font color="yellow">You should've asked the kids for permission first.</font>

550
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,438
<font color="yellow">- Be quiet. - I won't argue with you.</font>

551
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,108
<font color="yellow">The teacher told us not to fight.</font>

552
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:10,468
<font color="yellow">- Get in. I'll drive you. - I'll call a taxi.</font>

553
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:11,838
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

554
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:17,608
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

555
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,708
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to drop by and say hi.</font>

556
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:22,668
<font color="yellow">I bought this for you.</font>

557
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,168
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

558
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,768
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some tea? - No, I just had some.</font>

559
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:29,508
<font color="yellow">- Sit down. - Okay.</font>

560
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:33,208
<font color="yellow">I want to buy you lunch,</font>

561
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:34,938
<font color="yellow">but I've been so busy.</font>

562
00:33:35,568 --> 00:33:37,438
<font color="yellow">I know you're busy.</font>

563
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:41,068
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask you.</font>

564
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:43,068
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

565
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,968
<font color="yellow">I think my sister's feeling a little unsettled.</font>

566
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:47,608
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is home.</font>

567
00:33:49,938 --> 00:33:53,268
<font color="yellow">I think you and my sister are similar.</font>

568
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:54,908
<font color="yellow">You don't say what's on your mind.</font>

569
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,108
<font color="yellow">Even though she doesn't express her feelings,</font>

570
00:33:58,908 --> 00:33:59,968
<font color="yellow">my sister...</font>

571
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,238
<font color="yellow">likes you a lot.</font>

572
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,908
<font color="yellow">I believe she's trying very hard.</font>

573
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:10,278
<font color="yellow">I want you to know that.</font>

574
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:14,138
<font color="yellow">I always feel sorry because I should take care of her.</font>

575
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:16,138
<font color="yellow">It's hard to do that with my personality.</font>

576
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,708
<font color="yellow">I hope you're not upset because I told you this.</font>

577
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:22,208
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I made you worry.</font>

578
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:24,868
<font color="yellow">I want to be good friends with you.</font>

579
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:31,638
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you came in.</font>

580
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,008
<font color="yellow">Take a shower and come out for dinner.</font>

581
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,038
<font color="yellow">Da Rong's kindergarten is...</font>

582
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:38,278
<font color="yellow">doing an annual family camping. Let's go together.</font>

583
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,968
<font color="yellow">- With me? - The whole family.</font>

584
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:42,538
<font color="yellow">Let's take Cho Rong and Ddol Ee, too.</font>

585
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:45,408
<font color="yellow">Can I go?</font>

586
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:48,208
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong and Da Rong won't like it.</font>

587
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:50,208
<font color="yellow">You can't walk on eggshells forever.</font>

588
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:51,938
<font color="yellow">We have to go through it...</font>

589
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,038
<font color="yellow">so let's not avoid it.</font>

590
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:58,778
<font color="yellow">Then, let's not take Ddol Ee.</font>

591
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:05,038
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

592
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,238
<font color="yellow">Your son is almost dying.</font>

593
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:10,908
<font color="yellow">I'm almost dying, too.</font>

594
00:35:11,638 --> 00:35:13,368
<font color="yellow">I feel like I will die early.</font>

595
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:17,338
<font color="yellow">Meet my son and persuade him, please.</font>

596
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:21,108
<font color="yellow">How can I stay put when I know he'll ruin his life?</font>

597
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:23,468
<font color="yellow">Please tell him to marry.</font>

598
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:33,138
<font color="yellow">He said he'll return if you marry.</font>

599
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:34,938
<font color="yellow">There's no other way.</font>

600
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:37,738
<font color="yellow">That's the only way you two will live.</font>

601
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:39,838
<font color="yellow">What will you do to make a living?</font>

602
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:42,468
<font color="yellow">Listen to your dad.</font>

603
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,038
<font color="yellow">You should follow your dad's orders.</font>

604
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:47,338
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how he raised you?</font>

605
00:35:47,908 --> 00:35:49,738
<font color="yellow">Your dad has gotten so old.</font>

606
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:51,778
<font color="yellow">He's aged so much.</font>

607
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:06,708
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mum. What is it?</font>

608
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:09,778
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Ddol Ee!</font>

609
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:12,278
<font color="yellow">Mum, why aren't you coming?</font>

610
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,008
<font color="yellow">I've been busy today.</font>

611
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,108
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, did you miss me?</font>

612
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:19,778
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've been waiting for you all day.</font>

613
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,738
<font color="yellow">It's only been a day, but he misses you so much.</font>

614
00:36:24,338 --> 00:36:25,908
<font color="yellow">I can't raise him without you.</font>

615
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,108
<font color="yellow">He asks for his mum only.</font>

616
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:30,778
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right there.</font>

617
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:39,778
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

618
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,308
<font color="yellow">- Mum! - Goodness.</font>

619
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,368
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, were you playing nice?</font>

620
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:47,508
<font color="yellow">Did you miss me?</font>

621
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:50,938
<font color="yellow">You're being so dramatic.</font>

622
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:53,338
<font color="yellow">He was looking for you all day.</font>

623
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,908
<font color="yellow">He woke up from his sleep several times.</font>

624
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:04,868
<font color="yellow">He never left your side when he was little.</font>

625
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:11,138
<font color="yellow">I'm going camping with Geum Sik and his kids. I want to take him.</font>

626
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,608
<font color="yellow">Leave him.</font>

627
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,968
<font color="yellow">He's finally getting better. He shouldn't see them again.</font>

628
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:18,808
<font color="yellow">How did you decide to go camping?</font>

629
00:37:19,138 --> 00:37:21,538
<font color="yellow">They go from Da Rong's kindergarten every year.</font>

630
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:24,038
<font color="yellow">Did they say they'll go with you instead of their mum?</font>

631
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:26,138
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik said so.</font>

632
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:29,308
<font color="yellow">That's good. That's how things are supposed to be.</font>

633
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:33,068
<font color="yellow">What should I do about Ddol Ee? I'll be gone overnight.</font>

634
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,138
<font color="yellow">You can take care of him once you get back.</font>

635
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:38,538
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense. Why would you do that?</font>

636
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,668
<font color="yellow">- Let's do that. - No, I'm not going.</font>

637
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:44,408
<font color="yellow">I thought we were going with Mum for sure.</font>

638
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,138
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go either. I want to go with Mum.</font>

639
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,008
<font color="yellow">Mum hurt her leg. She can't come.</font>

640
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:52,168
<font color="yellow">Don't be a rebel. We're going with Ms Shin tomorrow.</font>

641
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,138
<font color="yellow">Mum, did you hurt your leg?</font>

642
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:06,068
<font color="yellow">Yes, I pulled some muscles.</font>

643
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:09,368
<font color="yellow">You hurt your leg so we're going camping with Ms Shin.</font>

644
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:10,938
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

645
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:14,438
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if your leg or back hurts. You have to go.</font>

646
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:16,168
<font color="yellow">They're going overnight.</font>

647
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:18,968
<font color="yellow">Call Geum Sik and tell him you're coming.</font>

648
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:22,438
<font color="yellow">The girls dislike her. What is he trying to do?</font>

649
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:25,278
<font color="yellow">I don't understand Geum Sik sometimes.</font>

650
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:28,638
<font color="yellow">He heard what the teacher said but he would never change.</font>

651
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,038
<font color="yellow">He has to think of the kids first.</font>

652
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:38,868
<font color="yellow">You don't have to come. You hurt your leg so get some rest.</font>

653
00:38:38,938 --> 00:38:41,508
<font color="yellow">All right. Go by yourself.</font>

654
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:43,068
<font color="yellow">I'll go on my own.</font>

655
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:46,068
<font color="yellow">I don't want to argue with you so I'm hanging up.</font>

656
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,108
<font color="yellow">Hey. Da Hae.</font>

657
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:06,368
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you need anything?</font>

658
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:07,968
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

659
00:39:07,968 --> 00:39:09,538
<font color="yellow">I packed some fruits.</font>

660
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:12,508
<font color="yellow">We have snacks to eat in the car, too.</font>

661
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:13,738
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to.</font>

662
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:16,438
<font color="yellow">It's more than an hour away. We might get bored.</font>

663
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,208
<font color="yellow">Did I forget anything?</font>

664
00:39:18,408 --> 00:39:20,808
<font color="yellow">Your running shoes. You need running shoes.</font>

665
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:44,838
<font color="yellow">Wash up and go to bed. We have to wake up early tomorrow.</font>

666
00:39:48,278 --> 00:39:49,308
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

667
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:54,008
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I offered and now I have to take it up.</font>

668
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:56,468
<font color="yellow">Can you forgive me just this one time?</font>

669
00:39:58,368 --> 00:40:00,008
<font color="yellow">Da Hae is going to follow us.</font>

670
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:03,168
<font color="yellow">Knowing her, she'll come for sure.</font>

671
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,738
<font color="yellow">I don't know what will happen.</font>

672
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,308
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

673
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,538
<font color="yellow">I'll say hi to everybody and get back home right away.</font>

674
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:20,208
<font color="yellow">I won't lie.</font>

675
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:22,168
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

676
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:29,308
<font color="yellow">- We're leaving. - These are snacks for the girls.</font>

677
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:33,438
<font color="yellow">These are clothes. This is yours and that's for the kids.</font>

678
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:41,638
<font color="yellow">I don't need extra clothes. I'll be back before dinner.</font>

679
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:42,778
<font color="yellow">I look forward to good food.</font>

680
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:45,068
<font color="yellow">Let's spend some time alone.</font>

681
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:46,968
<font color="yellow">Choose a movie.</font>

682
00:40:55,208 --> 00:41:02,208
<font color="yellow">- The bird sings in the forest - The bird sings in the forest</font>

683
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:03,608
<font color="yellow">- You want one? - Yes.</font>

684
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,038
<font color="yellow">That house is still there.</font>

685
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,108
<font color="yellow">That was so long ago.</font>

686
00:41:34,508 --> 00:41:37,638
<font color="yellow">I think we finish with dinner. I'll go back tonight.</font>

687
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:39,668
<font color="yellow">I'll come in the morning to pick you up.</font>

688
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:41,208
<font color="yellow">That's not fair.</font>

689
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:42,708
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Let him leave.</font>

690
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:44,778
<font color="yellow">We'll have fun on our own.</font>

691
00:41:48,368 --> 00:41:49,408
<font color="yellow">Everybody!</font>

692
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,938
<font color="yellow">- Yes! - Yes!</font>

693
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:54,308
<font color="yellow">We have a barbecue party planned for dinner..</font>

694
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:57,838
<font color="yellow">but the grill is not ready, yet.</font>

695
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:00,338
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

696
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:03,308
<font color="yellow">So before dinner is ready,</font>

697
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:05,908
<font color="yellow">we'll play a game for an hour.</font>

698
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:08,668
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of prizes you can win.</font>

699
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:15,138
<font color="yellow">Let's start with a three-legged race.</font>

700
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:18,338
<font color="yellow">Parents, come forward with your child.</font>

701
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:22,738
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for my injury, I would have won all the prizes.</font>

702
00:42:22,738 --> 00:42:23,968
<font color="yellow">We have Dad.</font>

703
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:44,278
<font color="yellow">You can do it, Da Rong!</font>

704
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:48,508
<font color="yellow">- You can do it! - You can do it!</font>

705
00:42:48,738 --> 00:42:50,838
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - Let's go!</font>

706
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,738
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - One, two.</font>

707
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,368
<font color="yellow">- You can do it! - Hurry. Stand up.</font>

708
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:04,338
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - One, two. One, two. Good job.</font>

709
00:43:09,908 --> 00:43:11,808
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - One, two.</font>

710
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:15,708
<font color="yellow">- One, two. - Hurry!</font>

711
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:26,638
<font color="yellow">We won!</font>

712
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:43,868
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

713
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,068
<font color="yellow">We're siblings...</font>

714
00:43:46,738 --> 00:43:49,308
<font color="yellow">but I don't know what Joong Nyeon has in mind.</font>

715
00:43:50,668 --> 00:43:52,168
<font color="yellow">What if he got himself in trouble?</font>

716
00:43:52,768 --> 00:43:54,268
<font color="yellow">You would know.</font>

717
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:58,868
<font color="yellow">I can't say even if I know and I won't even if I know.</font>

718
00:43:58,868 --> 00:44:00,908
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you know.</font>

719
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:04,668
<font color="yellow">You're good at predicting other things. What about your brother?</font>

720
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,268
<font color="yellow">It's one or the other.</font>

721
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:08,738
<font color="yellow">It's either money or women problem.</font>

722
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:11,568
<font color="yellow">He's not tall and ugly.</font>

723
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:14,938
<font color="yellow">He's short and good looking.</font>

724
00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:16,938
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

725
00:44:17,038 --> 00:44:21,438
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim, you should watch yourself. You might be wailing soon.</font>

726
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:24,938
<font color="yellow">You know you have to take good care of your husband, right?</font>

727
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:28,838
<font color="yellow">It's not a one way route. He has to take good care of me, too.</font>

728
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:32,808
<font color="yellow">You still have to be good to him. Don't mistreat him because he's old.</font>

729
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,268
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

730
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:39,468
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

731
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,708
<font color="yellow">Do you have time for dinner?</font>

732
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:02,808
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to meet up with my high school friends.</font>

733
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,638
<font color="yellow">Can we meet some other time?</font>

734
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:06,368
<font color="yellow">I'll call you.</font>

735
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,238
<font color="yellow">Okay. Have fun.</font>

736
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:27,468
<font color="yellow">It's been a week since we started dating.</font>

737
00:45:32,038 --> 00:45:35,068
<font color="yellow">You can use me for a day. You can do whatever you want.</font>

738
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:38,508
<font color="yellow">- Can you get out of the way? - You have me all day.</font>

739
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:41,008
<font color="yellow">I don't usually do this.</font>

740
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,738
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this, too? Don't bother me and leave.</font>

741
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:46,538
<font color="yellow">Stop mocking me.</font>

742
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:48,868
<font color="yellow">I'm not mocking you.</font>

743
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,038
<font color="yellow">I'll get you flowers. Hit him with it.</font>

744
00:45:57,138 --> 00:45:58,268
<font color="yellow">Let me use you.</font>

745
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:00,268
<font color="yellow">Any time.</font>

746
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,938
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Cheers!</font>

747
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:17,008
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous, Gab Dol.</font>

748
00:46:18,268 --> 00:46:21,408
<font color="yellow">You'll pass, too. Watch me.</font>

749
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:24,468
<font color="yellow">I persevered through it all.</font>

750
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:28,208
<font color="yellow">Let's drink until we die. It's on me!</font>

751
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:55,668
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

752
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:58,508
<font color="yellow">Can you go by yourself?</font>

753
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:01,068
<font color="yellow">I'm heavyweight.</font>

754
00:47:07,668 --> 00:47:10,068
<font color="yellow">I'll be back. Order more sides.</font>

755
00:48:23,008 --> 00:48:24,008
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

756
00:48:35,308 --> 00:48:37,668
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you have met many girls like me.</font>

757
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:40,468
<font color="yellow">Girls who would go crazy about your money.</font>

758
00:48:44,108 --> 00:48:45,368
<font color="yellow">Did you get rid of all the girls?</font>

759
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:47,168
<font color="yellow">I showed you a proof already.</font>

760
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,668
<font color="yellow">Do you like me?</font>

761
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:56,838
<font color="yellow">Fine. It's not a big deal. Let's go out.</font>

762
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:23,838
<font color="yellow">Da Rong and I ran a three-legged race.</font>

763
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,268
<font color="yellow">We won the first place.</font>

764
00:49:25,908 --> 00:49:27,338
<font color="yellow">Dinner will be a barbecue party,</font>

765
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,408
<font color="yellow">but I'll skip it and go home.</font>

766
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:36,238
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy.</font>

767
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:40,068
<font color="yellow">- Ouch. - Oh, my.</font>

768
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:41,468
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - Mum!</font>

769
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:45,708
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

770
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:47,238
<font color="yellow">- I'm fine. - Really?</font>

771
00:49:47,238 --> 00:49:48,268
<font color="yellow">Try to get up.</font>

772
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,908
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

773
00:49:58,008 --> 00:49:59,008
<font color="yellow">What is it, Cho Rong?</font>

774
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:01,938
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

775
00:50:02,638 --> 00:50:05,908
<font color="yellow">Da Hae hurt her leg, so I stayed for the dinner.</font>

776
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:07,908
<font color="yellow">I'm still here with the girls.</font>

777
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:09,868
<font color="yellow">I'll text you when I head out.</font>

778
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,068
<font color="yellow">I just put the kids to bed. I'm coming home now.</font>

779
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:57,268
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I had to stay longer. Please wait for me.</font>

780
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:35,108
<font color="yellow">The girls are asleep.</font>

781
00:51:36,408 --> 00:51:38,138
<font color="yellow">I'll come back in the morning to pick them up.</font>

782
00:51:45,338 --> 00:51:46,338
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

783
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:50,608
<font color="yellow">Being here reminds me of the old days.</font>

784
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,308
<font color="yellow">I saw...</font>

785
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:57,238
<font color="yellow">the resort that we spent our first night together...</font>

786
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,268
<font color="yellow">on the way here.</font>

787
00:52:07,808 --> 00:52:09,968
<font color="yellow">It was our 100th days anniversary.</font>

788
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:14,108
<font color="yellow">I invited you to a trip because I wanted to spend a night with you.</font>

789
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:16,508
<font color="yellow">That day,</font>

790
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,038
<font color="yellow">I hid your car key on purpose.</font>

791
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:22,408
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be with you.</font>

792
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:24,808
<font color="yellow">I knew.</font>

793
00:52:29,408 --> 00:52:30,468
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you did.</font>

794
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:52,168
<font color="yellow">After I gave birth to Da Rong, I had such a hard time.</font>

795
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:54,868
<font color="yellow">I found out later that...</font>

796
00:52:55,608 --> 00:52:57,308
<font color="yellow">it was postpartum depression.</font>

797
00:52:59,538 --> 00:53:01,408
<font color="yellow">Why did you make me feel so lonely?</font>

798
00:53:03,408 --> 00:53:04,468
<font color="yellow">You said you loved me.</font>

799
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:10,838
<font color="yellow">Did you really love me?</font>

800
00:53:15,438 --> 00:53:16,938
<font color="yellow">I had never met a girl like you.</font>

801
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:20,968
<font color="yellow">My parents passed away, and I was left with my baby sister.</font>

802
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:24,368
<font color="yellow">I just tried to move forward without a break.</font>

803
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:29,438
<font color="yellow">I worked so hard, so people wouldn't look down on us.</font>

804
00:53:31,038 --> 00:53:33,508
<font color="yellow">I always tried to do the right thing. To me, you were...</font>

805
00:53:37,068 --> 00:53:38,068
<font color="yellow">a shock.</font>

806
00:53:38,938 --> 00:53:41,008
<font color="yellow">A model student and a delinquent girl.</font>

807
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:43,468
<font color="yellow">I fell for you instantly.</font>

808
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:46,208
<font color="yellow">I really did.</font>

809
00:53:49,338 --> 00:53:50,868
<font color="yellow">I let you lead me as you like.</font>

810
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:58,208
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say you were sick?</font>

811
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:03,938
<font color="yellow">You didn't give me a chance to say it.</font>

812
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:07,438
<font color="yellow">I didn't even get to see you.</font>

813
00:54:08,468 --> 00:54:10,308
<font color="yellow">You were always working late or on business trips.</font>

814
00:54:10,468 --> 00:54:12,368
<font color="yellow">My company was starting off, so I was busy and tired.</font>

815
00:54:13,608 --> 00:54:16,208
<font color="yellow">I thought making a lot of money was what I could do for you.</font>

816
00:54:16,308 --> 00:54:17,508
<font color="yellow">It was my dream...</font>

817
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:20,668
<font color="yellow">to make a lot of money and buy you everything you wanted.</font>

818
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:22,968
<font color="yellow">That's not what I really wanted.</font>

819
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:28,668
<font color="yellow">When you came home, you didn't even look at me.</font>

820
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:32,138
<font color="yellow">You only looked down on me and got your dander up.</font>

821
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:37,538
<font color="yellow">That made me act perverse.</font>

822
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:40,638
<font color="yellow">Taking pills for depression didn't help, too.</font>

823
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:43,408
<font color="yellow">After a while,</font>

824
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:46,038
<font color="yellow">I started not to care about anything, even the girls.</font>

825
00:54:47,338 --> 00:54:48,968
<font color="yellow">That doesn't justify your betrayal.</font>

826
00:54:49,408 --> 00:54:50,738
<font color="yellow">I could put up with it...</font>

827
00:54:51,408 --> 00:54:52,868
<font color="yellow">when you abandoned the kids,</font>

828
00:54:53,808 --> 00:54:55,308
<font color="yellow">spent all the money I gave you...</font>

829
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:58,038
<font color="yellow">and fell into debt. I could put up with all of that.</font>

830
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:02,468
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard I tried to forget about it?</font>

831
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:05,368
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

832
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:07,738
<font color="yellow">You were...</font>

833
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:11,538
<font color="yellow">the first woman I loved.</font>

834
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:14,068
<font color="yellow">It was nothing. I don't even remember the guy.</font>

835
00:55:15,168 --> 00:55:17,808
<font color="yellow">I don't remember his name or face.</font>

836
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:19,408
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

837
00:55:20,308 --> 00:55:23,668
<font color="yellow">met him a few times because I was lonely and bored.</font>

838
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:26,208
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

839
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:43,808
<font color="yellow">Frankly,</font>

840
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:45,968
<font color="yellow">I still had feelings about you.</font>

841
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:48,968
<font color="yellow">I was jealous.</font>

842
00:55:49,368 --> 00:55:50,968
<font color="yellow">Then why did you get married so fast?</font>

843
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:52,168
<font color="yellow">It was for the kids.</font>

844
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:53,808
<font color="yellow">I was so busy with my work.</font>

845
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:56,338
<font color="yellow">I was always working late that I couldn't take care of them.</font>

846
00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:58,508
<font color="yellow">- You could hire a nanny. - I did.</font>

847
00:55:58,508 --> 00:56:00,168
<font color="yellow">I tried hiring different nannies.</font>

848
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:02,808
<font color="yellow">That didn't help. It only made things worse for the girls.</font>

849
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:05,038
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even work any more.</font>

850
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:06,708
<font color="yellow">Still, you should've put your children first.</font>

851
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,338
<font color="yellow">I got married because I put them first!</font>

852
00:56:09,768 --> 00:56:10,838
<font color="yellow">It's not an excuse.</font>

853
00:56:12,008 --> 00:56:14,008
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have gotten married if it hadn't been for the girls.</font>

854
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:17,408
<font color="yellow">I was sick of women.</font>

855
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:21,568
<font color="yellow">You traumatised me. I couldn't trust women.</font>

856
00:56:22,408 --> 00:56:25,168
<font color="yellow">People told me to marry an unmarried person,</font>

857
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:28,068
<font color="yellow">but I chose someone with a kid on purpose.</font>

858
00:56:29,538 --> 00:56:33,038
<font color="yellow">I thought someone with a kid would be better for Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

859
00:56:33,968 --> 00:56:36,538
<font color="yellow">But after we started to live together...</font>

860
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,908
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it would be this hard.</font>

861
00:57:10,308 --> 00:57:11,508
<font color="yellow">Are you going home?</font>

862
00:57:14,008 --> 00:57:16,538
<font color="yellow">- I should. - It's past 3am already.</font>

863
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:19,338
<font color="yellow">Will you come back?</font>

864
00:57:21,968 --> 00:57:24,008
<font color="yellow">If you are, then why?</font>

865
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:26,168
<font color="yellow">It's not as if it's urgent.</font>

866
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:28,438
<font color="yellow">The kids are both here as well.</font>

867
00:57:29,308 --> 00:57:31,238
<font color="yellow">I think it's best if I sleep before we set off.</font>

868
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:32,908
<font color="yellow">Go back in.</font>

869
00:57:37,638 --> 00:57:38,938
<font color="yellow">Sleep comfortably indoors.</font>

870
00:57:40,568 --> 00:57:41,708
<font color="yellow">If that feels strange,</font>

871
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:44,208
<font color="yellow">let's have some beer.</font>

872
00:57:52,908 --> 00:57:55,868
<font color="yellow">I need to drive. I can't drink. Go back in.</font>

873
00:58:17,738 --> 00:58:19,438
<font color="yellow">(Jae Soon)</font>

874
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:56,868
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

875
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:58,968
<font color="yellow">Dad, Mum disappeared.</font>

876
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:01,768
<font color="yellow">- What? - She left her phone.</font>

877
00:59:01,868 --> 00:59:02,968
<font color="yellow">Did you have a fight again?</font>

878
00:59:02,968 --> 00:59:04,908
<font color="yellow">Wait here. I'll go find her.</font>

879
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:07,738
<font color="yellow">Da Rong.</font>

880
00:59:09,608 --> 00:59:10,608
<font color="yellow">Da Rong.</font>

881
00:59:11,938 --> 00:59:13,068
<font color="yellow">Da Hae.</font>

882
00:59:17,038 --> 00:59:18,438
<font color="yellow">Da Hae.</font>

883
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,138
<font color="yellow">I brought jjamppong. Eat up.</font>

884
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:42,238
<font color="yellow">What did Gab Soon say? Didn't she love it?</font>

885
00:59:42,338 --> 00:59:44,238
<font color="yellow">I didn't see her. I was busy.</font>

886
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:47,268
<font color="yellow">What? Did you change your mind already?</font>

887
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:50,238
<font color="yellow">- What? - I'm disappointed in you.</font>

888
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:51,468
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be like that.</font>

889
00:59:52,038 --> 00:59:54,038
<font color="yellow">Now that you've become a civil servant, did you change your mind?</font>

890
00:59:54,538 --> 00:59:57,508
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't breakup with someone you've been going out for 10 years,</font>

891
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:58,568
<font color="yellow">It's nothing like that.</font>

892
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:00,838
<font color="yellow">Beware.</font>

893
01:00:01,968 --> 01:00:03,908
<font color="yellow">- What? - Girls change their minds easily.</font>

894
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:07,168
<font color="yellow">If you're like this, Gab Soon will change her mind.</font>

895
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,008
<font color="yellow">She still has feelings for you.</font>

896
01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:12,808
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you see her after you knew you passed the exam?</font>

897
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,508
<font color="yellow">She should have been the first person you saw.</font>

898
01:00:15,368 --> 01:00:16,868
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, if you don't know anything.</font>

899
01:00:17,438 --> 01:00:18,568
<font color="yellow">Goodness me.</font>

900
01:00:22,968 --> 01:00:24,508
<font color="yellow">Hey! Bae Dal Tong!</font>

901
01:00:27,008 --> 01:00:31,008
<font color="yellow">She was with us till last night. Then she went inside to sleep.</font>

902
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:33,068
<font color="yellow">When the kids woke up in the morning...</font>

903
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:34,138
<font color="yellow">- Mum! - Mum!</font>

904
01:00:37,108 --> 01:00:40,308
<font color="yellow">I apologise. She's here. I'm really sorry for this.</font>

905
01:00:40,468 --> 01:00:41,608
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Bye.</font>

906
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:43,608
<font color="yellow">Sorry again.</font>

907
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:05,768
<font color="yellow">(Service area)</font>

908
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:14,438
<font color="yellow">(Insert cash)</font>

909
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:15,638
<font color="yellow">Is this right?</font>

910
01:01:19,768 --> 01:01:20,808
<font color="yellow">Let's do this.</font>

911
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:33,438
<font color="yellow">What took you so long? Why didn't you answer your phone? Get in!</font>

912
01:01:35,568 --> 01:01:37,968
<font color="yellow">Why are you in such a hurry?</font>

913
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:40,838
<font color="yellow">Who are you rushing off to see?</font>

914
01:01:41,008 --> 01:01:42,268
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, the kids will hear.</font>

915
01:01:42,268 --> 01:01:44,868
<font color="yellow">If you want to go home, go by yourself.</font>

916
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,438
<font color="yellow">We'll take a taxi.</font>

917
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:47,938
<font color="yellow">If you won't come, go by yourself.</font>

918
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:53,338
<font color="yellow">You're impossible to talk to.</font>

919
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:55,538
<font color="yellow">Stop it, the kids are here.</font>

920
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:58,908
<font color="yellow">- We were told not to fight. - You're picking a fight.</font>

921
01:01:58,908 --> 01:02:00,708
<font color="yellow">You made me annoyed.</font>

922
01:02:02,068 --> 01:02:03,408
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

923
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:07,608
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, don't cry.</font>

924
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:09,538
<font color="yellow">You made everyone worried.</font>

925
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:12,838
<font color="yellow">If you're that old, you should be predictable.</font>

926
01:02:12,968 --> 01:02:14,638
<font color="yellow">How could you be like that?</font>

927
01:02:14,638 --> 01:02:17,168
<font color="yellow">Were you scared that I might have died?</font>

928
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:20,468
<font color="yellow">It's not like I have life insurance. Why would you want that?</font>

929
01:02:20,468 --> 01:02:21,868
<font color="yellow">Why are you like that?</font>

930
01:02:22,408 --> 01:02:24,138
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make Da Rong like me?</font>

931
01:02:24,768 --> 01:02:26,538
<font color="yellow">Mum and Dad, grow up!</font>

932
01:02:26,938 --> 01:02:28,868
<font color="yellow">Why did you call the police?</font>

933
01:02:30,368 --> 01:02:31,468
<font color="yellow">The kids want to go shopping.</font>

934
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:35,338
<font color="yellow">They don't like the clothes the woman buys for them.</font>

935
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:37,838
<font color="yellow">Drop me off at the department store and give me a credit card.</font>

936
01:02:38,068 --> 01:02:40,208
<font color="yellow">You said your legs hurt. Go next time.</font>

937
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:41,808
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

938
01:02:43,868 --> 01:02:46,568
<font color="yellow">I can do anything to go shopping.</font>

939
01:02:56,668 --> 01:02:57,808
<font color="yellow">Buy only the kids' clothes.</font>

940
01:02:58,338 --> 01:03:00,068
<font color="yellow">Don't even think of buying yours.</font>

941
01:03:00,308 --> 01:03:01,508
<font color="yellow">Don't make a scene.</font>

942
01:03:04,138 --> 01:03:05,168
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

943
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:36,808
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

944
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:40,338
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

945
01:03:40,738 --> 01:03:43,738
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since I've been here. I can't resist it.</font>

946
01:04:05,638 --> 01:04:07,168
<font color="yellow">I have no excuse.</font>

947
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:10,368
<font color="yellow">I wanted to put the kids to sleep and come home straight away.</font>

948
01:04:10,368 --> 01:04:11,368
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

949
01:04:15,308 --> 01:04:16,308
<font color="yellow">Let's...</font>

950
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:18,668
<font color="yellow">stop this here.</font>
