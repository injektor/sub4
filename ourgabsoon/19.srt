00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:17,171
<font color="yellow">You haven't been eating or sleeping for several days. What's wrong?</font>

3
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:19,471
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid that you won't pass?</font>

4
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:22,901
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

5
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:26,701
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You'll get it this time for sure.</font>

6
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:29,471
<font color="yellow">I even prayed to your father.</font>

7
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,571
<font color="yellow">I prayed that you would pass this time.</font>

8

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,401
<font color="yellow">I can't bare to watch you worry so much.</font>

11
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,001
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep now that you've taken medicine.</font>

12
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:44,571

16
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,001

<font color="yellow">What are you doing here so late?</font>

21
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:43,841
<font color="yellow">I want to see Gab Dol.</font>

22
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,171
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to see him?</font>

23
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,901
<font color="yellow">I have to tell him something.</font>

24
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,401
<font color="yellow">He's sleeping.</font>

25
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:51,201
<font color="yellow">Please let me see him just this once.</font>

26
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:53,171
<font color="yellow">I must tell him something.</font>

27
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,941
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

28
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:57,101
<font color="yellow">What could you possibly say to him?</font>

29
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,001
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

30
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:01,971
<font color="yellow">Why can't you let him go?</font>

31
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:06,101
<font color="yellow">I've said it again and again. You and Gab Dol are on different paths.</font>

32
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:08,801
<font color="yellow">If you have something to tell him, just tell me. I will tell him.</font>

33
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,771
<font color="yellow">Please let me just see him for a minute.</font>

34
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,941
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to get back together.</font>

35
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,901
<font color="yellow">I really have something to tell him. Let me just tell him that.</font>

36
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:18,001
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want to say?</font>

37
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,301
<font color="yellow">I am not pleased about you being like this.</font>

38
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,471
<font color="yellow">Why don't you listen when elders talk to you?</font>

39
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,871
<font color="yellow">Why are you so stubborn and talking back to me?</font>

40
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:27,401
<font color="yellow">Dad, I feel bad for Gab Soon.</font>

41

<font color="yellow">I am mending my underwear.</font>

42
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,141

43
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,101
<font color="yellow">- Just this one time, please. - What's wrong with you?</font>

44

<font color="yellow">Go back now. I'm have things to do.</font>

45
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,501
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you're here,</font>

46
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,871
<font color="yellow">but don't ruin my son's future.</font>

47
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,471
<font color="yellow">He's just waiting for the good news.</font>

48
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,301
<font color="yellow">How dare you show your face here so late at night?</font>

49
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,971
<font color="yellow">What if this causes bad luck?</font>

50
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:53,341
<font color="yellow">Go back now.</font>

51
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,341
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

52
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:10,871
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

53
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,141
<font color="yellow">Evil spirits, go away.</font>

54

56
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,241
<font color="yellow">Do not tell what you just saw and heard to Gab Dol.</font>

57
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,071
<font color="yellow">I will neither relay nor deliver.</font>

58
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,741

<font color="yellow">Isn't that right, Soo Jo?</font>

60
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,501
<font color="yellow">That's right. We are not loud mouths.</font>

61
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,341
<font color="yellow">We didn't hear anything because we were busy mending our underwear.</font>

62
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:57,001
<font color="yellow">I think I know why Gab Dol's father passed away so early.</font>

63
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,641
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

64
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:08,071
<font color="yellow">Hear me out before you go.</font>

65
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,801
<font color="yellow">No, I won't.</font>

66
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:12,571

70
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,941

<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say to him?</font>

75
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,571

76
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,741
<font color="yellow">Let's talk since you're here.</font>

77
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:21,771
<font color="yellow">I've wanted to ask you about this for a while.</font>

78
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,071
<font color="yellow">The money for our living expenses.</font>

79
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,771
<font color="yellow">We always get it from your mother-in-law.</font>

80
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:29,271
<font color="yellow">Can she just make a bank transfer from now on?</font>

81
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,541
<font color="yellow">I feel like she's meeting me just to rub it in.</font>

82
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,671
<font color="yellow">"You should go out more often."</font>

83
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,201
<font color="yellow">"Were you making kimchi?"</font>

84
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,301
<font color="yellow">She always shows off.</font>

85
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:43,671
<font color="yellow">My pride doesn't allow me to listen to that.</font>

86
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:47,671
<font color="yellow">I made you a doctor, not her.</font>

87
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:51,841
<font color="yellow">Why must I get your hard earned money through her?</font>

88
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,041
<font color="yellow">I will talk to her.</font>

89
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:55,701
<font color="yellow">It should have been like that from the beginning.</font>

90
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:57,671
<font color="yellow">It's all your father's fault.</font>

91
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,101
<font color="yellow">He doesn't think through things.</font>

92
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:05,571
<font color="yellow">He insists that a wife needs to manage husband's salary.</font>

93
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,541
<font color="yellow">You were like that, too.</font>

94
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,041
<font color="yellow">How are your wife and I alike?</font>

95
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,401
<font color="yellow">He's here.</font>

96
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,071
<font color="yellow">- Jae Soon. - When did you get here?</font>

97
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,701
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

98
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:21,771
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep, so I came after kids went to bed.</font>

99
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:23,301
<font color="yellow">I bought some fruit.</font>

100
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,241
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

101
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,271
<font color="yellow">No reason.</font>

102
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,441
<font color="yellow">Does he need a reason to be here?</font>

103
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:30,871
<font color="yellow">He's here to see me.</font>

104
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:32,871
<font color="yellow">We ate dinner.</font>

105
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:36,601
<font color="yellow">Is Dad sleeping?</font>

106
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:39,301
<font color="yellow">He went to look for Se Bang. He hasn't returned.</font>

107
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,371
<font color="yellow">He went to the homeless yesterday.</font>

108
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:46,541
<font color="yellow">Today, he's meeting some of his business associates.</font>

109
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:50,041
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's going on. What if he's completely bankrupt?</font>

110
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:54,641
<font color="yellow">Man should always have backup plans.</font>

111
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:57,301
<font color="yellow">He was overspending his money.</font>

112
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,701
<font color="yellow">Are you sad because he was once your husband?</font>

113
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:06,071
<font color="yellow">I am not happy. I wish he was doing well.</font>

114
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:07,571
<font color="yellow">That'd would be nice.</font>

115
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,071
<font color="yellow">If he is completely bankrupt, that would have been something.</font>

116
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:13,841
<font color="yellow">You would have been out on the streets with Ddol Ee.</font>

117
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,741
<font color="yellow">Nothing is certain. Don't say such things.</font>

118
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,471
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving. I'll see you later.</font>

119
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,801
<font color="yellow">Eat this before you go.</font>

120
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:25,301
<font color="yellow">I got rid of your dad's stuff before he found out.</font>

121
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,041
<font color="yellow">Without his permission?</font>

122
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,101
<font color="yellow">Why do I need his permission?</font>

123
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,301
<font color="yellow">I gave it all to the salvage and cleaned everything out.</font>

124
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,401
<font color="yellow">I feel so great.</font>

125
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,041
<font color="yellow">He will be so angry.</font>

126
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:39,041
<font color="yellow">I don't care if he's angry. It's better to hear him complain.</font>

127
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,641
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live with that junk.</font>

128
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:42,971
<font color="yellow">I will be able sleep well from now on.</font>

129
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,201
<font color="yellow">You should have gotten his permission first.</font>

130
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,601
<font color="yellow">He will be very upset.</font>

131
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,441
<font color="yellow">We should deliver the news, right?</font>

132
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,441
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Let's betray her one time.</font>

133
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:00,241
<font color="yellow">He's suffering so much.</font>

134
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:04,701

136
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:39,841

00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,071
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, Gab Soon was here.</font>

138
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,401
<font color="yellow">I think she came to beg for your forgiveness, Gab Dol.</font>

139
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:50,441
<font color="yellow">Turn on the light.</font>

140
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,741

142
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,071

146
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,071
<font color="yellow">The medicine is effective. I wonder what it is.</font>

147
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:32,141
<font color="yellow">I wish I could sleep like him.</font>

148
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:35,271
<font color="yellow">Me, too. I guess when you're wealthy, you can sleep like that.</font>

149
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,371
<font color="yellow">Should we spray water on him?</font>

150
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,871
<font color="yellow">No, let him be. This is his fate.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why are you all here? Is something wrong?</font>

155
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:27,771
<font color="yellow">Nothing's wrong. It just happened.</font>

156
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,301
<font color="yellow">Se Gye had dinner already.</font>

157
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:34,371
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon couldn't sleep so she brought some fruit.</font>

158
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,741
<font color="yellow">Are you banding together?</font>

159
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,111
<font color="yellow">To kick us out?</font>

160
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,471
<font color="yellow">You're quick-witted. Did you find him?</font>

161
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,971
<font color="yellow">No, I need to go again tomorrow.</font>

162
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,611
<font color="yellow">You should go. It's late.</font>

163
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,501
<font color="yellow">- Okay, good night. - Okay, good night.</font>

164
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,571
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

165
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:50,441
<font color="yellow">- I'll go, Mum. - Okay. See you.</font>

166
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,541
<font color="yellow">I cleaned the room.</font>

167
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,141
<font color="yellow">What a surprise.</font>

168
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,071
<font color="yellow">What's this? Where is everything?</font>

169
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:10,971
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

170
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:16,501
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

171
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,741
<font color="yellow">She's gone and done it.</font>

172
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,641
<font color="yellow">Can't you hear me?</font>

173
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,271
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

174
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:27,871
<font color="yellow">Come here now.</font>

175
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,941
<font color="yellow">There's no need. A thank you will be fine.</font>

176
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,271
<font color="yellow">In Nae Shim.</font>

177
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:39,341
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Dad.</font>

178
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,301
<font color="yellow">Who told you to clear that?</font>

179
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,271
<font color="yellow">- Who told you to? - Don't get angry.</font>

180
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,701
<font color="yellow">How could you not even ask me? You know what that means to me.</font>

181
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,101
<font color="yellow">Why are you like this?</font>

182
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:52,771
<font color="yellow">You did wrong.</font>

183
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,471
<font color="yellow">Tell him you're sorry.</font>

184
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,371
<font color="yellow">- I haven't done anything wrong. - What?</font>

185
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,741
<font color="yellow">She must have put it away since it bothered her.</font>

186
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,341
<font color="yellow">It's already done.</font>

187
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:03,641
<font color="yellow">Why are you like this as well?</font>

188
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:05,201
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

189
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:08,241
<font color="yellow">Even my children aren't on my side.</font>

190
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:12,741
<font color="yellow">How could you do as you wish? Who do you think you are?</font>

191
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:14,571
<font color="yellow">I'm nothing.</font>

192
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:16,601
<font color="yellow">Look at you talk.</font>

193
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:18,271
<font color="yellow">Stop. The kids are watching.</font>

194
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:22,001
<font color="yellow">Why would you put that in the house? It looks haunted.</font>

195
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,271
<font color="yellow">- I put it away as I had bad dreams. - You...</font>

196
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,301
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Dad.</font>

197
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:28,001
<font color="yellow">Leave him. Let's see what he does.</font>

198
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,001
<font color="yellow">Do you think that little of me?</font>

199
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:32,001
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a pushover?</font>

200
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,401
<font color="yellow">- Oh. my. - How could you not ask me?</font>

201
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:37,471
<font color="yellow">If you had 3 children with me and lived with me for 40 years,</font>

202
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:40,501
<font color="yellow">isn't it time that you took interest in how I feel,</font>

203
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:43,041
<font color="yellow">what I think and why I'm like this?</font>

204
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,541
<font color="yellow">Are you even interested?</font>

205
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,571
<font color="yellow">Your only interest is money.</font>

206
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,871
<font color="yellow">Say that after you've given some money.</font>

207
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:49,971
<font color="yellow">Have I not earned money?</font>

208
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,401
<font color="yellow">Have I not given you 10 dollars or 50 dollars?</font>

209
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,971
<font color="yellow">From a dollar to pennies, I brought home all the money there is.</font>

210
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:58,371
<font color="yellow">What have I not brought home?</font>

211
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:00,301
<font color="yellow">You brought home all your wage.</font>

212
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,401
<font color="yellow">As if that was much.</font>

213
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,541
<font color="yellow">It's not even funny.</font>

214
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,201
<font color="yellow">Just because I put away some garbage.</font>

215
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:08,801
<font color="yellow">Does that look like garbage to you?</font>

216
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,841
<font color="yellow">Yes. Then what is it?</font>

217
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,401
<font color="yellow">Right, junk.</font>

218
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,171
<font color="yellow">They don't even pay much for that.</font>

219
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,701
<font color="yellow">Here. Here's the money.</font>

220
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:20,501
<font color="yellow">Are you like this because of this?</font>

221
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:24,771
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

222
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,801
<font color="yellow">Do you even understand me?</font>

223
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,871
<font color="yellow">Did I live with you for 40 years?</font>

224
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,071
<font color="yellow">How could you be worse than a stranger?</font>

225
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,271
<font color="yellow">How could you not understand me?</font>

226
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:37,471
<font color="yellow">Do you understand me then?</font>

227
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,801
<font color="yellow">How I felt every time I picked those...</font>

228
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:43,601
<font color="yellow">out from the trash can.</font>

229
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,701
<font color="yellow">Look at him lost for words.</font>

230
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:51,641
<font color="yellow">He's such a brilliant talker.</font>

231
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:55,941
<font color="yellow">He must be so frustrated that he can't even talk.</font>

232
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,001
<font color="yellow">When he was young,</font>

233
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,241
<font color="yellow">he used to compete in speech contests.</font>

234
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:04,641
<font color="yellow">You used to scold me for crying.</font>

235
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,771
<font color="yellow">Now you're the one crying.</font>

236
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,071
<font color="yellow">You cry so often now that you've aged. What's gotten into you?</font>

237
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:13,441
<font color="yellow">If you have nothing to do, clean the house.</font>

238
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,701
<font color="yellow">What use is garbage?</font>

239
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,401
<font color="yellow">Why are you angry?</font>

240
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:21,171
<font color="yellow">I can't walk around the streets because I'm embarrassed.</font>

241
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:24,071
<font color="yellow">Who cares if our children live well or not?</font>

242
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,341
<font color="yellow">You shame the kids.</font>

243
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:31,071
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon's future husband will come by tomorrow. You should be ashamed.</font>

244
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,571
<font color="yellow">Do I embarrass you?</font>

245
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,101
<font color="yellow">Yes, you embarrass me so much.</font>

246
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,741
<font color="yellow">Is that all you have to say?</font>

247
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,771
<font color="yellow">I feel so alone.</font>

248
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,771
<font color="yellow">Don't regret this.</font>

249
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,501
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Dad.</font>

250
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,571
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.</font>

251
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,401
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

252
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:19,041
<font color="yellow">You went too far. You have no regard for him.</font>

253
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,801
<font color="yellow">You should have asked him first.</font>

254
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:24,201
<font color="yellow">He collected it for years.</font>

255
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,771
<font color="yellow">Don't point the finger at me.</font>

256
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:30,441
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon needs to marry this year.</font>

257
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,741
<font color="yellow">We have no money saved up and I felt frustrated so I sold it off.</font>

258
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,801
<font color="yellow">Mum. He won't come. We won't get married.</font>

259
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,271
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

260
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,801
<font color="yellow">Is it because of the money? Don't worry.</font>

261
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:43,341
<font color="yellow">I'll apply a mortgage and get the money ready.</font>

262
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,541
<font color="yellow">Don't be discouraged and go with it.</font>

263
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:47,501
<font color="yellow">It's not that. I'm not getting married.</font>

264
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:48,771
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

265
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,201
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

266
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,271
<font color="yellow">I'm frustrated already. Just do as I say.</font>

267
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,041
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

268
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:58,141
<font color="yellow">I won't get married. I can't.</font>

269
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,071
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

270
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:04,971
<font color="yellow">- Did he find out? - What?</font>

271
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:07,201
<font color="yellow">A historical night.</font>

272
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,771
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm sorry.</font>

273
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:13,241
<font color="yellow">He didn't go out with me because he liked me.</font>

274
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,301
<font color="yellow">He was just playing with me.</font>

275
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:20,071
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

276
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,601
<font color="yellow">How could you meet him without knowing that?</font>

277
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:28,801
<font color="yellow">Let me get my hands on him.</font>

278
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:33,771
<font color="yellow">It's not his fault. It's mine.</font>

279
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:35,501
<font color="yellow">I'm the crazy one.</font>

280
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,541
<font color="yellow">I thought I got lucky when I met him when working at the cafe.</font>

281
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,601
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to see in me.</font>

282
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,941
<font color="yellow">Even Gab Dol's mum looks down on me.</font>

283
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,271
<font color="yellow">I didn't know myself.</font>

284
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:48,601
<font color="yellow">I thought my Prince Charming had finally come.</font>

285
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:52,571
<font color="yellow">My goodness. A Prince Charming.</font>

286
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,641
<font color="yellow">What did you do all this time not knowing that?</font>

287
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:57,141
<font color="yellow">You're so smart.</font>

288
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,971
<font color="yellow">Didn't you realise whether he was joking with you or not?</font>

289
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:04,971
<font color="yellow">And you come home crying, annoyed that a man broke up with you?</font>

290
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:05,971
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Mum.</font>

291
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:08,371
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon's the most hurt. Stop, Mum.</font>

292
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:11,571
<font color="yellow">How could all the guys you meet have nothing good about them...</font>

293
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,871
<font color="yellow">or just play with you?</font>

294
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,871
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

295
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,841
<font color="yellow">I'm not crying because he broke up with me.</font>

296
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,871
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm disappointed in myself. I'm angry at myself.</font>

297
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,101
<font color="yellow">Being so poor is the problem.</font>

298
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,041
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

299
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:34,641
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

300
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:45,001
<font color="yellow">Have you ever taken my side?</font>

301
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:48,771
<font color="yellow">If we met after a divorce, we should try harder to make it work.</font>

302
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,401
<font color="yellow">Are you happy to make me that woman that looks through your phone?</font>

303
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:57,141
<font color="yellow">I thought you hated liars. You're the liar.</font>

304
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:01,201
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

305
00:19:03,771 --> 00:19:05,141
<font color="yellow">If I could explain myself,</font>

306
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,311
<font color="yellow">I lied because I didn't want you to worry.</font>

307
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:16,501
<font color="yellow">Nothing that you're worried about ever happened.</font>

308
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:18,141
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

309
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,311
<font color="yellow">I won't make you worry about that ever again.</font>

310
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,541
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

311
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,371
<font color="yellow">for putting up with this...</font>

312
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:37,771
<font color="yellow">and waiting for me.</font>

313
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:23,001
<font color="yellow">This phone is turned off. You will be directed to voicemail.</font>

314
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,741
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. - Can you sleep?</font>

315
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,941
<font color="yellow">How could you sleep after kicking him out?</font>

316
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,741
<font color="yellow">- I didn't sleep. - Look at you lie.</font>

317
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,471
<font color="yellow">He went out because of you.</font>

318
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:56,871
<font color="yellow">What if something happens to him?</font>

319
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:58,871
<font color="yellow">Don't even say that.</font>

320
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:04,071
<font color="yellow">Where is he till this hour?</font>

321
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,601
<font color="yellow">He has nowhere to go.</font>

322
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:08,971
<font color="yellow">What if he had stupid thoughts?</font>

323
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,501
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

324
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,041
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

325
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:19,241
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

326
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:31,001
<font color="yellow">This phone is turned off.</font>

327
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,401
<font color="yellow">Mum, why?</font>

328
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:49,101
<font color="yellow">Your dad hasn't come home yet. What should I do?</font>

329
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,301
<font color="yellow">Not yet?</font>

330
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,271
<font color="yellow">He still hasn't come back?</font>

331
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,571
<font color="yellow">Why would he go about and make people worried?</font>

332
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,471
<font color="yellow">What if he got into an accident?</font>

333
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,271
<font color="yellow">If that happened, we would have been contacted.</font>

334
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:02,801
<font color="yellow">I'll find out.</font>

335
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,641
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Nothing's wrong.</font>

336
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:19,101
<font color="yellow">This phone is turned off. You will be directed to voicemail.</font>

337
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,371
<font color="yellow">Please speak after the beep.</font>

338
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:23,971
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

339
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:27,541
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't call Mum, at least call me.</font>

340
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,871
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting.</font>

341
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,041
<font color="yellow">Does it work?</font>

342
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:43,941
<font color="yellow">It doesn't? Are you sure?</font>

343
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:45,871
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

344
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,671
<font color="yellow">You haven't gone to work yet.</font>

345
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:56,201
<font color="yellow">I will in a moment. You can use the toilet.</font>

346
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,741
<font color="yellow">I didn't come to use the toilet.</font>

347
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:00,371
<font color="yellow">- I came because of this. - What's that?</font>

348
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,201
<font color="yellow">As you can see, it's mandarin.</font>

349
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,441
<font color="yellow">One wouldn't be enough, so I bought 2 for each 6 in total.</font>

350
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,171
<font color="yellow">Since you have 3 people, it's 6, right?</font>

351
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,001
<font color="yellow">Are you asking for an extension on your monthly rent?</font>

352
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,571
<font color="yellow">No. It has nothing to do with my rent.</font>

353
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,401
<font color="yellow">- I'll have to see. - What?</font>

354
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:17,671
<font color="yellow">You're asking me to stay quiet when we go to the Yeo house.</font>

355
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:19,701
<font color="yellow">I'm moved.</font>

356
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,941
<font color="yellow">You are incredible,</font>

357
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,601
<font color="yellow">instantly understanding what I mean.</font>

358
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,601
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop with the scam.</font>

359
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:28,401
<font color="yellow">I'll come clean soon. Please give me some time before then.</font>

360
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:32,371
<font color="yellow">I'm terrified that you might tell the truth.</font>

361
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,571
<font color="yellow">I spent big money.</font>

362
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,071
<font color="yellow">You did.</font>

363
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:39,401
<font color="yellow">Am I allowed to receive that?</font>

364
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,171
<font color="yellow">What's the name of the law again?</font>

365
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:43,271
<font color="yellow">I heard that it's strong. So everyone's cautious.</font>

366
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:44,571
<font color="yellow">Kim Young Ran Act.</font>

367
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,971
<font color="yellow">Kim Young Ran. My first lover's name is Kim Young Ran.</font>

368
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:49,101
<font color="yellow">I thought it was Baek Suk.</font>

369
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:51,841
<font color="yellow">Take it with you. I don't want to get caught.</font>

370
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:53,241
<font color="yellow">This is all right.</font>

371
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:55,871
<font color="yellow">I asked Sam Sik just now. He knows everything.</font>

372
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,071
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

373
00:23:57,841 --> 00:23:59,601
<font color="yellow">I will eat it as you brought it.</font>

374
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:02,101
<font color="yellow">I can't make promises as I can't keep things to myself.</font>

375
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:03,601
<font color="yellow">I'll have to ask my mouth.</font>

376
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:06,601
<font color="yellow">That's why I brought mandarins. To please your mouth.</font>

377
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:10,501
<font color="yellow">Or else I have no other choice but to tell Gab Dol about what I saw...</font>

378
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:13,241
<font color="yellow">- last night about Gab Soon. - Are you threatening me?</font>

379
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:15,241
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

380
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:19,571
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying, but I was surprised when I went to their house.</font>

381
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:23,101
<font color="yellow">It felt like the house belonged to you.</font>

382
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:27,071
<font color="yellow">Do you know the halo that shines behind you?</font>

383
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:31,141
<font color="yellow">I heard from when I was little that I looked elegant.</font>

384
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:34,641
<font color="yellow">Even when I worked at restaurants, people thought I was the owner.</font>

385
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,141
<font color="yellow">I'll try to keep my mouth shut.</font>

386
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,971
<font color="yellow">Madam. Thank you. Bless you.</font>

387
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,501
<font color="yellow">When Gab Dol wakes up, give him some porridge that I made.</font>

388
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:00,971
<font color="yellow">Give him his medicine.</font>

389
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:03,571
<font color="yellow">Today's unlucky again.</font>

390
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:07,041
<font color="yellow">If you have time for that, go meet your ex-husband.</font>

391
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:08,301
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

392
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,971
<font color="yellow">Use your brains.</font>

393
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,871
<font color="yellow">What brains do I have?</font>

394
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,771
<font color="yellow">Can't you realise that he has feelings for you?</font>

395
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:17,141
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

396
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:18,541
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even eat it,</font>

397
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,171
<font color="yellow">but he sat in front of you till you finished your rice soup.</font>

398
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:24,071
<font color="yellow">Who would wait for that?</font>

399
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,141
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say, Mother?</font>

400
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:31,001
<font color="yellow">You know. Why are you pretending to be clueless...</font>

401
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,271
<font color="yellow">when you have the brains for this?</font>

402
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:36,501
<font color="yellow">It's not possible.</font>

403
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,741
<font color="yellow">He's married and living well. What is there for me to do?</font>

404
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:43,141
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

405
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:47,541
<font color="yellow">Quickly. Do it once.</font>

406
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:50,201
<font color="yellow">It feels awkward. I've never done it.</font>

407
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:52,001
<font color="yellow">Copy me.</font>

408
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,941
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

409
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,471
<font color="yellow">I will, in due time.</font>

410
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:58,971
<font color="yellow">Let's use the familiar form.</font>

411
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,701
<font color="yellow">I think we should stop using the honorific. It makes us feel distant.</font>

412
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:05,001
<font color="yellow">Once I started using the familiar form,</font>

413
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,501
<font color="yellow">I began to talk bluntly and swear.</font>

414
00:26:07,871 --> 00:26:09,071
<font color="yellow">That won't happen to us.</font>

415
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:13,301
<font color="yellow">Then I'll use the familiar form first.</font>

416
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:16,771
<font color="yellow">I thought you said I can have one wish.</font>

417
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:20,171
<font color="yellow">I want us to use familiar form and call each other "Honey".</font>

418
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,201
<font color="yellow">- All right. - You're using it again.</font>

419
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:25,641
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

420
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,041
<font color="yellow">Will you come home late?</font>

421
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:34,171
<font color="yellow">I'll come home early.</font>

422
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:35,871
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

423
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:37,571
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

424
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:39,501
<font color="yellow">I have to talk with A Young about...</font>

425
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:41,071
<font color="yellow">the wedding gifts so I'll have dinner at home.</font>

426
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,671
<font color="yellow">- At home. - What do you want to eat?</font>

427
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,201
<font color="yellow">I like everything you cook.</font>

428
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,741
<font color="yellow">- How about spicy seafood stew? - That sounds great.</font>

429
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,941
<font color="yellow">Spicy seafood stew and soju.</font>

430
00:26:51,771 --> 00:26:54,541
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I've never done that before.</font>

431
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:57,601
<font color="yellow">You can do that?</font>

432
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,501
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed.</font>

433
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,501
<font color="yellow">I've never done this either.</font>

434
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:10,871
<font color="yellow">I'll be off.</font>

435
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,571
<font color="yellow">Mum. What's the matter?</font>

436
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:26,741
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

437
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:32,441
<font color="yellow">This phone is turned off. You will be directed to voicemail.</font>

438
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:34,741
<font color="yellow">Please speak after the beep.</font>

439
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:36,401
<font color="yellow">He won't pick up.</font>

440
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,841
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

441
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:40,741
<font color="yellow">What if something happened to him?</font>

442
00:27:40,941 --> 00:27:42,241
<font color="yellow">Wait till he comes back.</font>

443
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:45,741
<font color="yellow">I don't understand him? Does he understand me?</font>

444
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,201
<font color="yellow">He's not a kid. Why would he make us worry like this?</font>

445
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,571
<font color="yellow">He said he'll go looking for your ex-husband.</font>

446
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:53,571
<font color="yellow">Then he needs to find him soon to help you out.</font>

447
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:55,571
<font color="yellow">Is that important now?</font>

448
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,171
<font color="yellow">We don't even know if Joong Nyeon is alive.</font>

449
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:16,301
<font color="yellow">This phone is turned off. You will be directed to voicemail.</font>

450
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:18,801
<font color="yellow">Please speak after the beep.</font>

451
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:23,941
<font color="yellow">Come home. Stop making your children worried. Come home.</font>

452
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,601
<font color="yellow">Come home and let's talk.</font>

453
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:35,001
<font color="yellow">He would be fine.</font>

454
00:28:35,301 --> 00:28:37,101
<font color="yellow">I'll look into it. Don't worry.</font>

455
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:39,241
<font color="yellow">All right, Mum.</font>

456
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,141
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font>

457
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:46,771
<font color="yellow">I'll tell the chief and go out to find him.</font>

458
00:28:46,871 --> 00:28:48,171
<font color="yellow">Do you know where he might be?</font>

459
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:51,401
<font color="yellow">I bet you didn't have time to talk about yourself.</font>

460
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,341
<font color="yellow">He took a day off?</font>

461
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,001
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

462
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:17,241
<font color="yellow">(Gong Joo)</font>

463
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:23,071
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

464
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:25,401
<font color="yellow">Where are you? I heard you took a day off.</font>

465
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:29,201
<font color="yellow">Yes. Something came up. Did you come by the hospital?</font>

466
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,801
<font color="yellow">To pick up Grandpa's medicine.</font>

467
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,671
<font color="yellow">Mum wants to speak to you.</font>

468
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,301
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

469
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:36,171
<font color="yellow">What do you mean "no"?</font>

470
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,701
<font color="yellow">How could you go on a vacation without asking for my permission?</font>

471
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,371
<font color="yellow">- It's not vacation. - Didn't you go on a trip?</font>

472
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:44,701
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to a wedding of my teacher's son.</font>

473
00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:46,871
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I couldn't mention it earlier.</font>

474
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:48,741
<font color="yellow">I just received the invitation.</font>

475
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:50,641
<font color="yellow">You must be out of your mind.</font>

476
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:52,271
<font color="yellow">What about my father?</font>

477
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,071
<font color="yellow">I'll call him and tell him.</font>

478
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,001
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

479
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,401
<font color="yellow">Your face and body are all wrinkly.</font>

480
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:11,471
<font color="yellow">Did you think clothes would make you younger?</font>

481
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:25,501
<font color="yellow">You're going to break your bone.</font>

482
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,771
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

483
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:29,601
<font color="yellow">Do you think it can smooth out your wrinkles?</font>

484
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:30,841
<font color="yellow">Give it a rest.</font>

485
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:32,171
<font color="yellow">You can't even do it.</font>

486
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:50,101
<font color="yellow">You'll see. I'll become muscular in a month.</font>

487
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:52,641
<font color="yellow">Easier said than done.</font>

488
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:56,671
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to make a bet? - Whatever.</font>

489
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,101
<font color="yellow">How about 100 dollars?</font>

490
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,341
<font color="yellow">I guess I'll get some easy money. You can pay me in advance.</font>

491
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:03,441
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

492
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:07,041
<font color="yellow">If you say I'm wrinkly one more time, I won't stand it.</font>

493
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,241
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? Can you survive without my food?</font>

494
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:16,501
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam. The professor will come, so prepare some fruits.</font>

495
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,071
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm doing it already.</font>

496
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:21,071
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

497
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,171
<font color="yellow">I just took a guess.</font>

498
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:24,441
<font color="yellow">Call me "ma'am".</font>

499
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:28,171
<font color="yellow">- Sure, Ma'am. - Why would she call you "ma'am"?</font>

500
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:30,041
<font color="yellow">Of course she should.</font>

501
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,541
<font color="yellow">Ignore her.</font>

502
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:36,771
<font color="yellow">How can I ignore her?</font>

503
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:38,641
<font color="yellow">She keeps telling me to call her "ma'am".</font>

504
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,441
<font color="yellow">Just listen to what I say.</font>

505
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:45,841
<font color="yellow">Flowers.</font>

506
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,341
<font color="yellow">I didn't prepare any.</font>

507
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:50,571
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it just for the first day?</font>

508
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:51,941
<font color="yellow">You still don't get it.</font>

509
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,941
<font color="yellow">You have to be consistent.</font>

510
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:55,871
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to get it next time.</font>

511
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:02,071
<font color="yellow">Get off and give me a bow. She's watching us.</font>

512
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,501
<font color="yellow">Call me if anything comes up.</font>

513
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,301
<font color="yellow">I already took care of it. It cost me a lot of money.</font>

514
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,571
<font color="yellow">Keep your head down.</font>

515
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,871
<font color="yellow">Welcome, Professor.</font>

516
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,641
<font color="yellow">My lecture ran late, so I couldn't buy the flowers.</font>

517
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:30,571
<font color="yellow">You don't have to do that every time.</font>

518
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:33,141
<font color="yellow">My father is taking a bath after working out.</font>

519
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:35,271
<font color="yellow">Taking a bath?</font>

520
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:37,201
<font color="yellow">My family often take baths.</font>

521
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:40,941
<font color="yellow">- Let me show you my room. - Your room?</font>

522
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,571
<font color="yellow">- Come this way. - Don't do this.</font>

523
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:46,601
<font color="yellow">- Don't you want to see my room? - No, I don't.</font>

524
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,141
<font color="yellow">It won't take long.</font>

525
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:50,841
<font color="yellow">Those are the words that scare me the most.</font>

526
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,801
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? Please don't do this.</font>

527
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,841
<font color="yellow">Please spare me. Ma'am!</font>

528
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,271
<font color="yellow">Why don't you give it a rest?</font>

529
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:01,001
<font color="yellow">Hello, Professor.</font>

530
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,701
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ma'am. It's good to see you.</font>

531
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:06,271
<font color="yellow">Is it? You saw me this morning.</font>

532
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:07,701
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

533
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,971
<font color="yellow">Just ignore me.</font>

534
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,671
<font color="yellow">You're here, Professor.</font>

535
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:15,371
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Sir. - Have a seat.</font>

536
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:17,071
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat, Professor.</font>

537
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:25,841
<font color="yellow">Si Nae.</font>

538
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:38,071
<font color="yellow">What happened to the renter who looks like him?</font>

539
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:41,871
<font color="yellow">He came back, begged for my forgiveness.</font>

540
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:45,441
<font color="yellow">I couldn't do anything, so I just let him stay.</font>

541
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:46,841
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

542
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:51,741
<font color="yellow">- Ms Nam. - All right.</font>

543
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:55,001
<font color="yellow">He creeps and crawls everyday now,</font>

544
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:57,641
<font color="yellow">but who knows he won't run away again?</font>

545
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:01,741
<font color="yellow">He bought some mandarins for us. He could've bought a box,</font>

546
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:05,471
<font color="yellow">but he only bought 6, so each of us can have 2.</font>

547
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:06,801
<font color="yellow">He still says it cost him a lot.</font>

548
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,601
<font color="yellow">That's why he's just a renter.</font>

549
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:11,841
<font color="yellow">He must look so petty.</font>

550
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:15,741
<font color="yellow">He doesn't. He looks quite neat.</font>

551
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:18,741
<font color="yellow">Professor. You look very neat today.</font>

552
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:29,301
<font color="yellow">- "Oh, my. Don't do this to me." - Goodness.</font>

553
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:32,371
<font color="yellow">"A girl's heart is like a reed."</font>

554
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:35,271
<font color="yellow">"No. Why are you doing this?"</font>

555
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:37,371
<font color="yellow">"You shouldn't do this."</font>

556
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:40,711
<font color="yellow">Oh my, don't do this to me</font>

557
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:44,301
<font color="yellow">A girl's heart is like a reed</font>

558
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:48,071
<font color="yellow">"I'm not a great heroine of a novel or a movie,"</font>

559
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:52,341
<font color="yellow">"but I'll give my all to you."</font>

560
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:55,971
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

561
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,971
<font color="yellow">You must know a lot about women.</font>

562
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,641
<font color="yellow">He knows everything, Dad.</font>

563
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,471
<font color="yellow">I should learn from him.</font>

564
00:35:07,141 --> 00:35:10,241
<font color="yellow">Professor. Have you dated a lot of women?</font>

565
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:14,101
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - You shouldn't ask him that.</font>

566
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,871
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik has feelings for you, silly.</font>

567
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:34,301
<font color="yellow">Can't you take the hint?</font>

568
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,601
<font color="yellow">Display them well so women can easily buy them.</font>

569
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:49,171
<font color="yellow">Sir. Did you come to inspect us?</font>

570
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:51,471
<font color="yellow">I came here to buy you a treat.</font>

571
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:55,141
<font color="yellow">If you have any problems, report to me right away.</font>

572
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:56,301
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir.</font>

573
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,541
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

574
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:13,971
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner tonight.</font>

575
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:17,241
<font color="yellow">How about the seafood stew restaurant we used to go?</font>

576
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:19,471
<font color="yellow">That place is shabby, but the food is good.</font>

577
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:20,871
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

578
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:23,871
<font color="yellow">Hey. Go easy.</font>

579
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,941
<font color="yellow">I should go home early, and I'm also busy.</font>

580
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:29,401
<font color="yellow">- If you want to talk, talk now. - Are you playing hard to get?</font>

581
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:32,841
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk. Bye.</font>

582
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:37,801
<font color="yellow">Stop making noises.</font>

583
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,171
<font color="yellow">It's so annoying.</font>

584
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:51,571
<font color="yellow">Mum. Don't worry.</font>

585
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:53,671
<font color="yellow">It won't be anything serious.</font>

586
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:55,741
<font color="yellow">You haven't eaten, right?</font>

587
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:58,941
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik will be home early today.</font>

588
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:01,041
<font color="yellow">I'll come over after dinner.</font>

589
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:02,571
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later, Mum.</font>

590
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,271
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin. What is this?</font>

591
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:09,241
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

592
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,101
<font color="yellow">I forgot to tell you.</font>

593
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,641
<font color="yellow">I was washing it, and other clothes left a stain.</font>

594
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,301
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you a new dress.</font>

595
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:17,971
<font color="yellow">Why would you ruin my dress?</font>

596
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:20,301
<font color="yellow">You did it on purpose because my mum bought me this, right?</font>

597
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,971
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

598
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:24,971
<font color="yellow">- I'll buy you... - Forget it.</font>

599
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,671
<font color="yellow">Can't you wash clothes properly?</font>

600
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,441
<font color="yellow">I haven't even worn it yet.</font>

601
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:34,301
<font color="yellow">All you do is cringe to my dad.</font>

602
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:36,071
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

603
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:38,671
<font color="yellow">How dare you speak to her that way?</font>

604
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,211
<font color="yellow">Apologise to her.</font>

605
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:43,871
<font color="yellow">No. I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I apologise?</font>

606
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,711
<font color="yellow">She ruined my dress.</font>

607
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,001
<font color="yellow">That's enough!</font>

608
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,971
<font color="yellow">Don't. I made a mistake when I was washing it.</font>

00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,271
<font color="yellow">It's her favourite dress. I understand.</font>

610
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:53,771
<font color="yellow">I'm putting up with this because of her.</font>

611
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:56,071
<font color="yellow">If you do it again, I won't let it slide.</font>

612
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:58,001
<font color="yellow">You're betraying us.</font>

613
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:03,441
<font color="yellow">- Cho Rong, please... - Let me go!</font>

614
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:06,941
<font color="yellow">- Cho Rong! - I'm fine.</font>

615
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:10,001
<font color="yellow">She didn't do it on purpose. Go to your room.</font>

616
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:11,441
<font color="yellow">I'll go to Mum.</font>

617
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:15,071
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

618
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:17,641
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

619
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:20,671
<font color="yellow">- I should teach you a lesson. - No!</font>

620
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:22,271
<font color="yellow">Stay in there.</font>

621
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:26,771
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

622
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,641
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Stop crying.</font>

623
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,641
<font color="yellow">How much do you need?</font>

624
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:48,101
<font color="yellow">Should I ask him?</font>

625
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:50,711
<font color="yellow">It may be impolite to ask how much they want.</font>

626
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,601
<font color="yellow">Maybe we should just offer them a proper amount.</font>

627
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:54,971
<font color="yellow">Still, we should have an estimate.</font>

628
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,801
<font color="yellow">The more, the better.</font>

629
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,071
<font color="yellow">He's from a rich family.</font>

630
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:02,941
<font color="yellow">For A Young's sake, we should offer them as much as we can.</font>

631
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:06,171
<font color="yellow">It will help her be more confident.</font>

632
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:09,241
<font color="yellow">Of course. You're smarter than I thought, Jae Soon.</font>

633
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:11,871
<font color="yellow">Since I was little, people often told me that...</font>

634
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:13,671
<font color="yellow">I'm smarter than I look.</font>

635
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:17,071
<font color="yellow">(Dad)</font>

636
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:25,271
<font color="yellow">The person you're trying to reach is not available.</font>

637
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,341
<font color="yellow">Come out and eat.</font>

638
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,801
<font color="yellow">I don't want to eat. I have no appetite.</font>

639
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,341
<font color="yellow">Don't make me feel worse.</font>

640
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,101
<font color="yellow">I haven't eaten yet. Let's eat together.</font>

641
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:44,771
<font color="yellow">He's not answering my calls.</font>

642
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,741
<font color="yellow">He's mad at all of us. Of course he wouldn't answer.</font>

643
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,371
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have anywhere to go.</font>

644
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:54,571
<font color="yellow">He will come home if he runs out of money.</font>

645
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:56,501
<font color="yellow">What about Aunt?</font>

646
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:59,771
<font color="yellow">She had lunch and went out to look for your dad.</font>

647
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,271
<font color="yellow">I should pour some water so I can swallow.</font>

648
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,241
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mum.</font>

649
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,301
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

650
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,241
<font color="yellow">You should've checked before you date him.</font>

651
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:17,041
<font color="yellow">There's no one to blame. It's all because we're poor.</font>

652
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:19,101
<font color="yellow">If we were well-off,</font>

653
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,071
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't have fallen for someone like him.</font>

654
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:23,941
<font color="yellow">We're so poor...</font>

655
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,871
<font color="yellow">that you were blinded by greed.</font>

656
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,471
<font color="yellow">Just consider yourself unlucky and move on.</font>

657
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:33,341
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

658
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:37,441
<font color="yellow">How can you be eating?</font>

659
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:40,841
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon might be...</font>

660
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:43,711
<font color="yellow">starving or even dead.</font>

661
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:47,601
<font color="yellow">How can you be eating in peace right now?</font>

662
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:51,771
<font color="yellow">That's right. We are eating in peace.</font>

663
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:55,101
<font color="yellow">I have such a good appetite today. This is my second helping.</font>

664
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:56,471
<font color="yellow">You'll be punished.</font>

665
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:00,711
<font color="yellow">You threw out your husband. How could you have an appetite?</font>

666
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:05,141
<font color="yellow">Yes. I strangely have an appetite as if this is the last food we have.</font>

667
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:09,771
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Mum hasn't eaten anything all day until now.</font>

668
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:11,301
<font color="yellow">How could you do this?</font>

669
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,771
<font color="yellow">If your dad has gone missing, you should be out looking for him.</font>

670
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:20,071
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you're eating at home right now.</font>

671
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:25,641
<font color="yellow">Children are useless.</font>

672
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,441
<font color="yellow">You're useless.</font>

673
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:31,241
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon and Se Gye are the same.</font>

674
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:34,401
<font color="yellow">He worked so hard to raise you, but you all side with your mum.</font>

675
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:36,941
<font color="yellow">Who made all the money...</font>

676
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,671
<font color="yellow">to get you food, clothes and education?</font>

677
00:41:40,271 --> 00:41:41,271
<font color="yellow">Who did?</font>

678
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:48,471
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim. What's so great about you?</font>

679
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:50,871
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can look down on Joong Nyeon?</font>

680
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:55,271
<font color="yellow">You should've gotten his permission to get rid of his stuff.</font>

681
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:57,771
<font color="yellow">You can't do that as you please.</font>

682
00:41:58,241 --> 00:41:59,771
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Aunt.</font>

683
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,371
<font color="yellow">You couldn't say anything to him when he worked and got you money.</font>

684
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:06,301
<font color="yellow">Do you realise that you've changed?</font>

685
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,211
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do that.</font>

686
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:11,871
<font color="yellow">Your children will become just like you.</font>

687
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:14,841
<font color="yellow">It will all come back to you someday.</font>

688
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:17,871
<font color="yellow">It will bring you great pain.</font>

689
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:24,741
<font color="yellow">All right. Go on and take it all out on me.</font>

690
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:27,941
<font color="yellow">It has brought me pain a long time ago.</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't you dare do anything silly.</font>

715

739
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:24,771

<font color="yellow">I'm so relieved.</font>

743
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:33,741
<font color="yellow">Why would he worry his children like this?</font>

744
00:47:39,471 --> 00:47:41,141
<font color="yellow">Grandpa wouldn't wake up, right?</font>

745
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:43,641

749
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:55,401
<font color="yellow">He can't come home? Has he forgotten that he's married?</font>

750
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,341
<font color="yellow">I emphasised it so many times.</font>

751
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:01,341

772
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:54,441

773
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:56,201

775
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,341
<font color="yellow">I bumped into her while I was on delivery and I told her everything.</font>

776
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:03,801
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

777
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:06,971
<font color="yellow">I told her about you going to the police station and what he said.</font>

778
00:51:08,501 --> 00:51:11,741
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about her and don't talk to her about me.</font>

779
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:13,601
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to say hi to her any more.</font>

780
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,071
<font color="yellow">You should forget about her, too. She's high maintenance.</font>

781
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:18,871
<font color="yellow">- Eat. - Can you set me up a blind date?</font>

782
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:22,201
<font color="yellow">You're serious, right? I got it.</font>

783
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:27,271
<font color="yellow">I have one.</font>

784
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:30,641
<font color="yellow">She's from a rich family and is the only child. She drives a luxury car.</font>

785
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:34,201
<font color="yellow">Let's do it before it's too late.</font>

786
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,441
<font color="yellow">Why would she date me?</font>

787
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:38,541
<font color="yellow">She has a peculiar taste.</font>

788
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:41,701
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's Dal Tong.</font>

789
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:49,301
<font color="yellow">You can leave your wallet.</font>

790
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:52,101

792

793
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:16,671
<font color="yellow">When I study, I get game withdrawal symptoms...</font>

794
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:19,571
<font color="yellow">and when I play games, I get studying withdrawal...</font>

795
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,671
<font color="yellow">I guess I had no studying withdrawal symptoms.</font>

796
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,871
<font color="yellow">So you took the examination to be a public servant?</font>

797
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:27,771
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll pass?</font>

798
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:31,101
<font color="yellow">It's 3,000 percent. I have false hope.</font>

799
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:36,471
<font color="yellow">You're so funny.</font>

800
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:38,171
<font color="yellow">I don't see anything else in men.</font>

801
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:41,401
<font color="yellow">I don't care about your family, education or occupation.</font>

802
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,201
<font color="yellow">I just want you to be mentally stable and humorous.</font>

803
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:47,041
<font color="yellow">I look at their faces, too.</font>

804
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:49,371
<font color="yellow">I like small faces.</font>

805
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:51,341
<font color="yellow">That's my complaint.</font>

806

831
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:49,841
<font color="yellow">I'm anxious and restless.</font>

832
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:54,371
<font color="yellow">There's no joy of living.</font>

833
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:08,671
<font color="yellow">After I stopped working,</font>

834
00:59:09,741 --> 00:59:12,771
<font color="yellow">there was nowhere for me to go once I stepped outside.</font>

835

<font color="yellow">All day, I'd be sitting at one place...</font>

838
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:29,401

853
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:31,801
<font color="yellow">It felt like my own space.</font>

854
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:38,401
