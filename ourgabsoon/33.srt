1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:05,023
<font color="yellow">BioskopKeren</font>

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,300
<font color="yellow">He bought meat, fish and fruit.</font>

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,140
<font color="yellow">He even bought toys for Ddol Ee. How amazing.</font>

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,500
<font color="yellow">You're still the same.</font>

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,400
<font color="yellow">You are known for your generosity.</font>

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,670
<font color="yellow">You seem to have bought the whole store.</font>

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,270
<font color="yellow">I should bow to you properly.</font>

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,140
<font color="yellow">Don't bother.</font>

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,240
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do now that you're here all of a sudden.</font>

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
<font color="yellow">What are you going through everything?</font>

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,570
<font color="yellow">Whenever he came to visit,</font>

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,870
<font color="yellow">it was as if Santa Claus came to us.</font>

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,370
<font color="yellow">That's why we all used to wait for him.</font>

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,240
<font color="yellow">I didn't prepare separate gifts for you two.</font>

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,070
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare them next time. Yours too, Aunt.</font>

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,570
<font color="yellow">Are you going to buy me a fur coat?</font>

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,570
<font color="yellow">You just bought one for your mother-in-law but not for me.</font>

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,570
<font color="yellow">You look healthier now.</font>

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,200
<font color="yellow">It's because I led a well-regulated life there.</font>

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,770
<font color="yellow">You don't lead a well-regulated life.</font>

21
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,540
<font color="yellow">You always come home late at night and drink a lot.</font>

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,800
<font color="yellow">- I'm not like that any more. - Are you...</font>

23
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,670
<font color="yellow">well now?</font>

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, since I lived a well-regulated life.</font>

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,740
<font color="yellow">Where have you been? You didn't contact us at all.</font>

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,000
<font color="yellow">I was not able to because Jae Soon told me not to.</font>

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,270
<font color="yellow">It seems like you earned a lot of money,</font>

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,770
<font color="yellow">seeing that you even have your own driver.</font>

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,140
<font color="yellow">You look much better now.</font>

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,040
<font color="yellow">My business is going very well now.</font>

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,370
<font color="yellow">What do you do?</font>

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,570
<font color="yellow">(Jeon Se Bang, CEO)</font>

33
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I'm watching a noble CEO...</font>

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,070
<font color="yellow">sitting right in front of me.</font>

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,870
<font color="yellow">Se Bang, you're going to give me some allowance, right?</font>

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,440
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon.</font>

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,370
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,170
<font color="yellow">How kind of you.</font>

39
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,140
<font color="yellow">You brought me lunch. I should do at least this much.</font>

40
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,070
<font color="yellow">This is delicious.</font>

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want to get interrupted while we're alone.</font>

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,070
<font color="yellow">You'll be directed to voicemail.</font>

43
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,540
<font color="yellow">Please speak after the beep.</font>

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,140
<font color="yellow">- You haven't changed at all. - Of course.</font>

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,170
<font color="yellow">What kind of a business does Sebang Company do?</font>

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,500
<font color="yellow">We do construction, imports and many other things.</font>

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,840
<font color="yellow">What do you import?</font>

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking so many questions?</font>

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,700
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious.</font>

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,800
<font color="yellow">Did you get married again?</font>

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,770
<font color="yellow">Would he have come here if he got married?</font>

53
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,940
<font color="yellow">You're quick-witted as usual.</font>

54
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,770
<font color="yellow">I had no chance to meet a woman there.</font>

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,500
<font color="yellow">- Where is that? - Pardon?</font>

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,740
<font color="yellow">He was in China.</font>

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was in China.</font>

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,670
<font color="yellow">Then how did you get Ddol Ee's paperwork done there?</font>

59
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,200
<font color="yellow">Father came to see me.</font>

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,770
<font color="yellow">When did he go to China?</font>

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,170
<font color="yellow">He came to Korea briefly,</font>

62
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,570
<font color="yellow">and I met him at the airport to talk about that.</font>

63
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,670
<font color="yellow">You try to know too much.</font>

64
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,140
<font color="yellow">It's time that Jae Soon came home. Give her a call.</font>

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,270
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

66
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,000
<font color="yellow">You should get going.</font>

67
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry we had to meet at a convenience store. Just wait.</font>

68
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,540
<font color="yellow">If my business gets better, let's go to a fancy place.</font>

69
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,500
<font color="yellow">A date at a convenience store is not so bad.</font>

70
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,300
<font color="yellow">- I'll text you later. - You'll be in trouble if you don't.</font>

71
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,970
<font color="yellow">Please get going.</font>

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,040
<font color="yellow">I'd like to go far away with you today.</font>

73
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,000
<font color="yellow">My heart is fluttering.</font>

74
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,370
<font color="yellow">Let's go to a ski resort someday to see snow and have a snow fight.</font>

75
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,300
<font color="yellow">- Sure. When the kids go on... - Be quiet.</font>

76
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,540
<font color="yellow">We don't have kids, do we? We didn't even get married yet.</font>

77
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,840
<font color="yellow">When did you get out?</font>

78
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,570
<font color="yellow">I got out of there a month after you visited me.</font>

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,240
<font color="yellow">How could you come to my house? What were you thinking?</font>

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,570
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you and Mother.</font>

81
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,940
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't.</font>

82
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,870
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to see the parents of your ex-wife?</font>

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,540
<font color="yellow">It's not like we bumped into each other on the street.</font>

84
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,570
<font color="yellow">I met Ddol Ee.</font>

85
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,070
<font color="yellow">He told me that Jae Soon works at a supermarket...</font>

86
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,370
<font color="yellow">and that he is living at your house.</font>

87
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,940
<font color="yellow">- Did she get divorced? - Yes, she did.</font>

88
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,670
<font color="yellow">Then what happened to Ddol Ee's family registration?</font>

89
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,210
<font color="yellow">They got divorced right before they registered.</font>

90
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,070
<font color="yellow">That's great. Why did they get divorced?</font>

91
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,770
<font color="yellow">There are various reasons why a married couple gets divorced.</font>

92
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,340
<font color="yellow">They had a hard time because of the kids from both families.</font>

93
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,710
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Ddol Ee from now.</font>

94
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,440
<font color="yellow">I'll come to see him as well.</font>

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,670
<font color="yellow">I can't stop you from seeing your own child,</font>

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,570
<font color="yellow">but if they find out that you were in jail...</font>

97
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,970
<font color="yellow">Are you saying a man with a criminal record doesn't deserve to be a dad?</font>

98
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,440
<font color="yellow">I'm not a shameless, petty criminal. I ended up like that doing business.</font>

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,770
<font color="yellow">Whatever the case,</font>

100
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,770
<font color="yellow">it is true that you were punished because you violated the law.</font>

101
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,570
<font color="yellow">It's already the second time and you can't guarantee the future.</font>

102
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,700
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is still young. You can't take care of him.</font>

103
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,470
<font color="yellow">If Jae Soon finds out, she'll go mad.</font>

104
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,640
<font color="yellow">They say your attitude changes after urgent things are taken care of.</font>

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,700
<font color="yellow">You're not the exception.</font>

106
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,500
<font color="yellow">When you visited me to talk about Ddol Ee's registration,</font>

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,140
<font color="yellow">you didn't turn a cold shoulder like this.</font>

108
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,800
<font color="yellow">You broke your promise. That's why.</font>

109
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,270
<font color="yellow">You said you won't come to see Ddol Ee.</font>

110
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,140
<font color="yellow">It was you who told me to come to see him any time.</font>

111
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,970
<font color="yellow">I have a right to see my own child.</font>

112
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,570
<font color="yellow">I don't want to become uncomfortable with you any more.</font>

113
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,400
<font color="yellow">Please be nice to me next time.</font>

114
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,070
<font color="yellow">What did he say? Why did he say he came?</font>

115
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,870
<font color="yellow">He said he came to see Ddol Ee. Don't have any false hope.</font>

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,700
<font color="yellow">He says he came for Ddol Ee, but I think he thought of Jae Soon, too.</font>

117
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,540
<font color="yellow">He didn't even get remarried.</font>

118
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,340
<font color="yellow">Don't get ahead of yourself. You don't even look nice from behind.</font>

119
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,400
<font color="yellow">Since he looks rich, has a driver...</font>

120
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,400
<font color="yellow">and is a CEO, do you now see him differently?</font>

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,340
<font color="yellow">- That's not what I was saying. - What's wrong with that?</font>

122
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,900
<font color="yellow">Who would hate money?</font>

123
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,170
<font color="yellow">By the way, even though she doesn't, I look pretty from behind.</font>

124
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,670
<font color="yellow">There were many guys who followed me after watching me from behind.</font>

125
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,200
<font color="yellow">But they all ran away after looking at your face. Don't criticise me.</font>

126
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,570
<font color="yellow">- Didn't he say anything else? - No, he didn't.</font>

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,000
<font color="yellow">You guys are so materialistic. You go crazy about money.</font>

128
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,400
<font color="yellow">Does money show all of one's ability?</font>

129
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,270
<font color="yellow">Money is what makes a person attractive.</font>

130
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,570
<font color="yellow">Even when one is short and ugly, if he has money,</font>

131
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,700
<font color="yellow">he'll look attractive. Don't you agree?</font>

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,170
<font color="yellow">Tell me about it. You don't have to look at his appearance at all.</font>

133
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,270
<font color="yellow">Even my family is like this. I have no right to criticise others.</font>

134
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,640
<font color="yellow">They got divorced because they wanted to.</font>

135
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,100
<font color="yellow">That's in the past.</font>

136
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,270
<font color="yellow">How can I ignore him when he came to visit us? He's Ddol Ee's dad.</font>

137
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,500
<font color="yellow">Of course, we can't.</font>

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,340
<font color="yellow">Maybe, they're just meant to be after all.</font>

139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

140
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,340
<font color="yellow">You should be happy since you're so popular.</font>

141
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,900
<font color="yellow">Once a man goes, another man comes to see you.</font>

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,500
<font color="yellow">You never run out of men.</font>

143
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,140
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

144
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,140
<font color="yellow">I heard you made soup for Geum Sik.</font>

145
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,700
<font color="yellow">No, that's not true.</font>

146
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,700
<font color="yellow">What's this then?</font>

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,200
<font color="yellow">I made some soup to eat at the supermarket.</font>

148
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,440
<font color="yellow">I shared it with my co-workers.</font>

149
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,140
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee's dad came here just now.</font>

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,740
<font color="yellow">He's rich, and he became a CEO.</font>

151
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,570
<font color="yellow">He even brought a chauffeur. He looked splendid.</font>

152
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,740
<font color="yellow">He was like that back then, too. He's such a show-off.</font>

153
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,300
<font color="yellow">He looked better than before.</font>

154
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,870
<font color="yellow">He seemed to have come here to see you.</font>

155
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,070
<font color="yellow">He must be crazy. I don't need to see him any more.</font>

156
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,700
<font color="yellow">She seems to be totally into Geum Sik.</font>

157
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,870
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik? He's a stranger now. Don't call him by his first name.</font>

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,540
<font color="yellow">- What should I call him then? - Just call him Jo.</font>

159
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,670
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon is totally into Jo.</font>

160
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,240
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

161
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,070
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.</font>

162
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,070
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

163
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,940
<font color="yellow">Come again, please.</font>

164
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,040
<font color="yellow">- Bring us a beer. - Yes.</font>

165
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,500
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy.</font>

166
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,840
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's have some drinks since there are no other customers.</font>

167
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I don't sit at my customers' tables.</font>

168
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,810
<font color="yellow">I can't drink, either.</font>

169
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,900
<font color="yellow">Stop acting shy and drink with us.</font>

170
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,700
<font color="yellow">You look like you drink a lot.</font>

171
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,070
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy.</font>

172
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,170
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you get married?</font>

173
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,069
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a boyfriend?</font>

174
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh. She's completely ignoring us.</font>

175
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,400
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Go easy on her.</font>

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,810
<font color="yellow">If you become my girlfriend, I'll come here every day to buy food.</font>

177
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,870
<font color="yellow">How dare she?</font>

178
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,570
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

179
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,900
<font color="yellow">Are you going to ignore your customer like this?</font>

180
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,400
<font color="yellow">She's making me lose my appetite.</font>

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

182
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,640
<font color="yellow">You punks.</font>

183
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,070
<font color="yellow">I tried to tolerate you because I wanted to earn money, but I can't.</font>

184
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't put up with you because I don't have a temper.</font>

185
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,700
<font color="yellow">I swallowed my pride only to be nice to my customers.</font>

186
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,570
<font color="yellow">Am I married?</font>

187
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,070
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm married. What are you going to do about that?</font>

188
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,400
<font color="yellow">I even have two children. Do you have a problem?</font>

189
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,270
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to sell food to jerks like you.</font>

190
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,170
<font color="yellow">So don't ever come near my restaurant.</font>

191
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,900
<font color="yellow">If I catch you one more time, I'm going to kill you.</font>

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,400
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

193
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,270
<font color="yellow">Why are you home so early? Didn't you get any customers?</font>

194
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,370
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

195
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,440
<font color="yellow">What? What is it?</font>

196
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,500
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

197
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,900
<font color="yellow">You should've called me.</font>

198
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,500
<font color="yellow">Those jerks.</font>

199
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,270
<font color="yellow">They must've looked down on you because you run the store alone.</font>

200
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,900
<font color="yellow">That's what makes you sad.</font>

201
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,170
<font color="yellow">I thought about calling the police,</font>

202
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,770
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't because I might lose customers over it.</font>

203
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,200
<font color="yellow">Those crazy punks. If they do this again, I'll kill them.</font>

204
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,370
<font color="yellow">You're so amazing, Mum.</font>

205
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,040
<font color="yellow">You sold all kinds of stuff...</font>

206
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,970
<font color="yellow">and raised two children by yourself when you were so young.</font>

207
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,070
<font color="yellow">I still didn't sell alcohol.</font>

208
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,770
<font color="yellow">This is what I was worried about.</font>

209
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,800
<font color="yellow">I was worried that...</font>

210
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,570
<font color="yellow">guys would bother you if you sold alcohol by yourself.</font>

211
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,370
<font color="yellow">But I thought you'd handle it well because you worked at karaokes.</font>

212
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,040
<font color="yellow">Can't you change your store to something else?</font>

213
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,040
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? I can't quit just because of some guys.</font>

214
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,140
<font color="yellow">I'm on a roll these days.</font>

215
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,470
<font color="yellow">I live here with you,</font>

216
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,740
<font color="yellow">and I don't even raise my children.</font>

217
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,570
<font color="yellow">All I do is run a store, but it's so hard.</font>

218
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,800
<font color="yellow">How did you overcome all those hard times?</font>

219
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,640
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking when overcoming them?</font>

220
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't even have time to think.</font>

221
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,770
<font color="yellow">I was just struggling to feed you and Gab Dol.</font>

222
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,700
<font color="yellow">Whenever guys bothered me,</font>

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,340
<font color="yellow">I held back my anger and cried alone at home.</font>

224
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,170
<font color="yellow">I didn't realise this before,</font>

225
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,170
<font color="yellow">but the person I admire the most isn't King Sejong or Yi Sun Shin.</font>

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,140
<font color="yellow">You're the person I admire the most in the world.</font>

227
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,570
<font color="yellow">There is nothing about me that you should admire.</font>

228
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
<font color="yellow">I just did what I had to do to take care of my children.</font>

229
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,370
<font color="yellow">Now I regret what I did.</font>

230
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,900
<font color="yellow">I should've been a better mother.</font>

231
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,340
<font color="yellow">Will Cho Rong and Da Rong...</font>

232
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,970
<font color="yellow">come and see me when they grow up?</font>

233
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,400
<font color="yellow">They will.</font>

234
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,270
<font color="yellow">Kids always come back to their parents.</font>

235
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,900
<font color="yellow">They'd be furious when they do. They'd want to get revenge.</font>

236
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,200
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't even want to run into me on the street.</font>

237
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,740
<font color="yellow">I'm not scared of anything else,</font>

238
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,540
<font color="yellow">but I'm so scared of Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

239
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,270
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

240
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,740
<font color="yellow">It's cold outside, right?</font>

241
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

242
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,840
<font color="yellow">Come and sit.</font>

243
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,040
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything to say to me?</font>

244
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,840
<font color="yellow">Are you going to talk to your mother at all?</font>

245
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,540
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

246
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,470
<font color="yellow">What have you been up to these days?</font>

247
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,840
<font color="yellow">I've been doing things to make money.</font>

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,470
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon asked me to work with her, so I'm thinking about it.</font>

249
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,800
<font color="yellow">Don't just think about it. Do the cleaning job with Gab Soon.</font>

250
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,540
<font color="yellow">Even if it's hard, you should do something you're not ashamed of.</font>

251
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,970
<font color="yellow">I made kimchi soup.</font>

252
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,570
<font color="yellow">Why don't you eat it with some rice while it's hot?</font>

253
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,000
<font color="yellow">I also fried an egg. It's your favourite.</font>

254
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,370
<font color="yellow">Every problem a child has is 100 percent the parents' fault.</font>

255
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,900
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let him wander off like that?</font>

256
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,570
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just move out and live with your son?</font>

257
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,640
<font color="yellow">Do you want that?</font>

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,470
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even eat the food I make. I can't live with him alone.</font>

259
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,870
<font color="yellow">He doesn't eat the food I give him.</font>

260
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,470
<font color="yellow">I'm scared of Dal Pa, Joong Nyeon.</font>

261
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,340
<font color="yellow">He's my son, but I feel uneasy and uncomfortable around him.</font>

262
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,040
<font color="yellow">I sometimes forget about him when I don't see him,</font>

263
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
<font color="yellow">but when I do see him,</font>

264
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,700
<font color="yellow">it drives me crazy.</font>

265
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,400
<font color="yellow">Try living with him alone.</font>

266
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,940
<font color="yellow">If you do, he will have to talk to you eventually.</font>

267
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,740
<font color="yellow">Isn't it obvious? He comes here to sleep.</font>

268
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,240
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a place to go.</font>

269
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,800
<font color="yellow">You should rent a room or something and move out.</font>

270
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,140
<font color="yellow">I don't want to have two people sponge off of me.</font>

271
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,240
<font color="yellow">I wanted to have a simple life. That's why...</font>

272
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,770
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon and I don't even eat together any more.</font>

273
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,570
<font color="yellow">You should've been better to him.</font>

274
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,570
<font color="yellow">You ordered him around when he was little.</font>

275
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,470
<font color="yellow">If I were him, I would hate you, too</font>

276
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,570
<font color="yellow">I feel frustrated when I see you.</font>

277
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What a lonely life.</font>

278
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,870
<font color="yellow">Clean here.</font>

279
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,670
<font color="yellow">Here, too. Brush these parts well.</font>

280
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,500
<font color="yellow">My mum wants you to clean these stairs well.</font>

281
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,940
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll clean them thoroughly.</font>

282
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
<font color="yellow">- Is this a follow-up service? - Yes.</font>

283
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,340
<font color="yellow">Is it profitable to provide a follow-up service?</font>

284
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,140
<font color="yellow">It gets dirty even after a day.</font>

285
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,040
<font color="yellow">I'm doing it to get regular customers.</font>

286
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,340
<font color="yellow">I introduced you to my mum because we went to the same high school.</font>

287
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,700
<font color="yellow">If you do a bad job like this, she will scold me.</font>

288
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,240
<font color="yellow">She promised me that she'll give me this building.</font>

289
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,640
<font color="yellow">If you do a nice job, I will introduce you to other people, too.</font>

290
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,010
<font color="yellow">Look at the dirt here.</font>

291
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,010
<font color="yellow">Here, too.</font>

292
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,740
<font color="yellow">I guess you should eat well to keep up your strength.</font>

293
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,740
<font color="yellow">Yes. I eat a lot these days.</font>

294
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,770
<font color="yellow">Please tell many people about my business. I will do my best.</font>

295
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,510
<font color="yellow">You're only a cleaner. Don't you dare to see my son.</font>

296
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,340
<font color="yellow">I'm having a hard time already.</font>

297
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,170
<font color="yellow">Everyone else may badmouth me and point their fingers at me,</font>

298
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,800
<font color="yellow">but you should understand me. I don't have a choice.</font>

299
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,100
<font color="yellow">This is the only thing I can do without money.</font>

300
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,010
<font color="yellow">Mum. Please give me three years.</font>

301
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,670
<font color="yellow">I'll succeed no matter what.</font>

302
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,870
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

303
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,170
<font color="yellow">I'm making some rags for Gab Soon.</font>

304
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,570
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

305
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,540
<font color="yellow">She said she'll become a cleaner and succeed in three years,</font>

306
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,170
<font color="yellow">so I went to see what she's up to.</font>

307
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,040
<font color="yellow">Her friend from high school was nagging her,</font>

308
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,240
<font color="yellow">and she was crouching and cleaning the stairs.</font>

309
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,740
<font color="yellow">Her friend had her arms folded,</font>

310
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,070
<font color="yellow">pointed her foot and ordered Gab Soon to clean.</font>

311
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,270
<font color="yellow">She said, "Do a good job. I guess you should eat well."</font>

312
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,170
<font color="yellow">But Gab Soon only said yes.</font>

313
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,940
<font color="yellow">She was swallowing her anger and tried to satisfy her friend.</font>

314
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,040
<font color="yellow">She was doing something I can't even do myself.</font>

315
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,870
<font color="yellow">I wanted to drag her out of there, but I didn't.</font>

316
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,140
<font color="yellow">It's good that you didn't.</font>

317
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,340
<font color="yellow">It'll make her grow up.</font>

318
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,900
<font color="yellow">She'll grow up a lot.</font>

319
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,400
<font color="yellow">How great would it be...</font>

320
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,570
<font color="yellow">if I can give my children money when they're having a hard time?</font>

321
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,900
<font color="yellow">I can't do that, so I'll just make her some rags.</font>

322
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,270
<font color="yellow">Do you still have things to say to me?</font>

323
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,070
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

324
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,370
<font color="yellow">You must've come for the necklace.</font>

325
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,510
<font color="yellow">Wait here. I'll go and get it.</font>

326
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,070
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me. It offends me.</font>

327
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,970
<font color="yellow">Did it feel good to shop for your mum's gift with that woman?</font>

328
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,270
<font color="yellow">Your mum must've been so happy.</font>

329
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,800
<font color="yellow">Her future daughter-in-law gave her underclothes.</font>

330
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,800
<font color="yellow">Why don't you lie to me again and say she's just your colleague?</font>

331
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,440
<font color="yellow">Did she pick out the necklace, too?</font>

332
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,010
<font color="yellow">Was it thrilling to lie to me...</font>

333
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,010
<font color="yellow">and fool around with her instead of working?</font>

334
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,100
<font color="yellow">That's right. I told you to go.</font>

335
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,540
<font color="yellow">But how could you really go right away?</font>

336
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,900
<font color="yellow">Do you call yourself a man?</font>

337
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,840
<font color="yellow">I'm not hearing anything you're saying right now.</font>

338
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,240
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

339
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,400
<font color="yellow">You only hear the words of that woman.</font>

340
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,570
<font color="yellow">Are we done here?</font>

341
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,100
<font color="yellow">Don't ever show up in front of me.</font>

342
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,800
<font color="yellow">I'm going to visit your parents this Saturday.</font>

343
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,440
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

344
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,100
<font color="yellow">I'll ask them to approve our marriage.</font>

345
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,200
<font color="yellow">- Don't get cute with me. - I'm not.</font>

346
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
<font color="yellow">- I know you can't. - I can.</font>

347
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,940
<font color="yellow">Do you think my parents are easy?</font>

348
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,170
<font color="yellow">You can't even convince your own mum.</font>

349
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
<font color="yellow">Do you think my parents will...</font>

350
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,040
<font color="yellow">gladly approve of you if you tell them that you'll marry me?</font>

351
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,070
<font color="yellow">I told you. I don't hear anything you say.</font>

352
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,440
<font color="yellow">I'll handle it in my own way.</font>

353
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,200
<font color="yellow">You've trusted me for over 10 years.</font>

354
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,200
<font color="yellow">Why don't you trust me one last time?</font>

355
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,170
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Don't you dare come to our house.</font>

356
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,840
<font color="yellow">I'm done talking.</font>

357
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,640
<font color="yellow">I'm not here to convince you.</font>

358
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,700
<font color="yellow">I just didn't want to surprise you later.</font>

359
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,470
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

360
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,240
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol! You must've gone crazy!</font>

361
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,400
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'm home.</font>

362
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,770
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

363
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,070
<font color="yellow">They're rags.</font>

364
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,070
<font color="yellow">Rags wear down, too. You need good rags to clean.</font>

365
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,770
<font color="yellow">You can't clean well with rags that are worn down.</font>

366
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,070
<font color="yellow">Did you make them yourself?</font>

367
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
<font color="yellow">Children are always trouble.</font>

368
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,500
<font color="yellow">Your dad made you a ladder, and I made you rag.</font>

369
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,370
<font color="yellow">Everyone is supporting you. If you don't succeed, I'll kick you out.</font>

370
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,440
<font color="yellow">Mum. I can't believe you made me rags.</font>

371
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,900
<font color="yellow">I'm so touched.</font>

372
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,000
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be. Just try to eat well.</font>

373
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,200
<font color="yellow">You can't do anything if you're weak.</font>

374
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,240
<font color="yellow">Also, if someone gives you a hard time, just quit.</font>

375
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,770
<font color="yellow">You'll be fine even if you lose one customer.</font>

376
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,170
<font color="yellow">You're wrong. Word-of-mouth reputation is very important.</font>

377
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,770
<font color="yellow">I will never succeed if I stand on pride.</font>

378
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,200
<font color="yellow">I put my pride in the fridge before I go to work. Didn't you see it?</font>

379
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,040
<font color="yellow">What should I do? I accidentally ate it for dinner.</font>

380
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,540
<font color="yellow">When I was pregnant with you, I had such an amazing dream.</font>

381
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,900
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't even realise you were pregnant.</font>

382
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,800
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

383
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,000
<font color="yellow">I prayed so hard to have another daughter.</font>

384
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,440
<font color="yellow">It was such a great dream.</font>

385
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,670
<font color="yellow">What was it?</font>

386
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
<font color="yellow">A tiger.</font>

387
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,800
<font color="yellow">A huge tiger like this came into my arms.</font>

388
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,740
<font color="yellow">It's still so vivid.</font>

389
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,440
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you'll succeed.</font>

390
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,470
<font color="yellow">I'll succeed no matter what. I'll live up to the dream.</font>

391
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,770
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you. Come out for a second.</font>

392
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

393
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,740
<font color="yellow">It's hard to lie about a dream.</font>

394
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,300
<font color="yellow">How can I resign as her parent?</font>

395
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,740
<font color="yellow">Someone invested in your business?</font>

396
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,800
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was going to wait until the opening ceremony,</font>

397
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,500
<font color="yellow">but I was so touched to receive rags from Mum.</font>

398
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,800
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for an office to rent.</font>

399
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,170
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked Dal Pa to work with me.</font>

400
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,270
<font color="yellow">- Did he say he'll do it? - He said he'll think about it.</font>

401
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,170
<font color="yellow">I told him to just do it.</font>

402
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,240
<font color="yellow">You'd better not order him around just because you're his boss.</font>

403
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,140
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon. Don't worry and order him around. I have your back.</font>

404
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
<font color="yellow">Are you done with driving practice?</font>

405
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm going to buy a used car.</font>

406
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,670
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for a small car.</font>

407
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,640
<font color="yellow">How much would that be?</font>

408
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,670
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask? It's not like you're going to pay for it.</font>

409
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,170
<font color="yellow">A usable car would cost at least 1,000 dollars.</font>

410
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,440
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

411
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,340
<font color="yellow">buy it for you.</font>

412
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,740
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Do you have money?</font>

413
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,500
<font color="yellow">I saved some money to take with me when I die.</font>

414
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,400
<font color="yellow">I should use that.</font>

415
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

416
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,440
<font color="yellow">(Sparkly Clean Gab Soon)</font>

417
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,140
<font color="yellow">If you're going to do that, do a better job.</font>

418
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

419
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,170
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business and go on your way.</font>

420
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,270
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and try.</font>

421
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,770
<font color="yellow">This is for Dad,</font>

422
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,940
<font color="yellow">and this is for you, Mum.</font>

423
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,200
<font color="yellow">- What are these? - They're vitamins.</font>

424
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,770
<font color="yellow">You don't have money. You shouldn't have bought them.</font>

425
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,140
<font color="yellow">If I make a lot of money, I'll buy you something better.</font>

426
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,140
<font color="yellow">I couldn't have started my own business if it weren't for you.</font>

427
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
<font color="yellow">You support me and stood by me. That's why I could start this.</font>

428
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,940
<font color="yellow">I feel like I have everything.</font>

429
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,170
<font color="yellow">Live until you're 100 years old, and don't get sick.</font>

430
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,270
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of your health for my own sake.</font>

431
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,700
<font color="yellow">It looks like I can't get sick because of my daughter.</font>

432
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,800
<font color="yellow">I told you children are always trouble.</font>

433
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,140
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

434
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,940
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

435
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,640
<font color="yellow">Is it Se Bang?</font>

436
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,000
<font color="yellow">I don't know which of Jae Soon's ex-husband it is.</font>

437
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,070
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon. When you think of something...</font>

438
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,370
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

439
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,300
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't just say it,</font>

440
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,800
<font color="yellow">but think about it one more time before I say it.</font>

441
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,140
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

442
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,740
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What brings you here, Gab Dol?</font>

443
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,570
<font color="yellow">Let's see. It's Gab Dol.</font>

444
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,370
<font color="yellow">Your future son-in-law is here, Nae Shim.</font>

445
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,540
<font color="yellow">Hello. Please take these.</font>

446
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,840
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What's all this?</font>

447
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,840
<font color="yellow">Now that you're a public official, you spend a lot of money.</font>

448
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,170
<font color="yellow">This is your first time bringing us something, isn't it?</font>

449
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Your sons-in-law bring you a lot of things these days.</font>

450
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,370
<font color="yellow">- You won't need to spend money. - Why are you here?</font>

451
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,070
<font color="yellow">I came to tell you something. Let me make a bow to you.</font>

452
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,940
<font color="yellow">We don't need your bow.</font>

453
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,770
<font color="yellow">- Forget it. - Why bother to come? It's all over.</font>

454
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,000
<font color="yellow">It's not over. Please let me make a bow to you.</font>

455
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,470
<font color="yellow">Since you're here already,</font>

456
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,640
<font color="yellow">say what you want to say. Don't make any bows.</font>

457
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,570
<font color="yellow">He wants you to talk and not make bows.</font>

458
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you.</font>

459
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,740
<font color="yellow">Things turned out this way because I didn't handle matters like a man.</font>

460
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,670
<font color="yellow">I hope you would forgive me for the things I did.</font>

461
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,700
<font color="yellow">I want to marry Gab Soon. Please let me marry her.</font>

462
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,240
<font color="yellow">That's enough. I don't need to hear more.</font>

463
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,940
<font color="yellow">She doesn't need to hear more.</font>

464
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,800
<font color="yellow">Please trust me one more time.</font>

465
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,040
<font color="yellow">I know I looked shabby when I was studying,</font>

466
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,570
<font color="yellow">but now I can have my own family and take care of Gab Soon.</font>

467
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,770
<font color="yellow">You only talk big.</font>

468
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,270
<font color="yellow">How are you going to take care of her?</font>

469
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,500
<font color="yellow">Can you even marry her?</font>

470
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,270
<font color="yellow">I wasn't opposed to it at first.</font>

471
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,300
<font color="yellow">You remember that, right?</font>

472
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,700
<font color="yellow">When you were studying, I made good dishes for you several times.</font>

473
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,340
<font color="yellow">If you consider that, you can't do this to Gab Soon.</font>

474
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,900
<font color="yellow">Your mother barged in here and threw a fit. I can't have that.</font>

475
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,570
<font color="yellow">Even if we're okay, what are you going to do with your family?</font>

476
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,970
<font color="yellow">Your mother is against it. Can you convince her?</font>

477
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,770
<font color="yellow">I'll convince her no matter what.</font>

478
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,100
<font color="yellow">What if you can't? Are you going to let Gab Soon down again?</font>

479
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,200
<font color="yellow">Even if she doesn't approve,</font>

480
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,100
<font color="yellow">I'll marry her.</font>

481
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,040
<font color="yellow">Why do you kids always cause trouble?</font>

482
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,570
<font color="yellow">If you can't convince your mother, just give up.</font>

483
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,570
<font color="yellow">I can't let my daughter marry that kind of family.</font>

484
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,770
<font color="yellow">Why would she marry you when your mother isn't welcoming her?</font>

485
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,870
<font color="yellow">Besides, you should consider your mother's hard work...</font>

486
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,570
<font color="yellow">and give up on Gab Soon.</font>

487
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,900
<font color="yellow">We and Gab Soon don't feel comfortable about this.</font>

488
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,640
<font color="yellow">Of course not. If they give away Gab Soon to that family,</font>

489
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,500
<font color="yellow">there will be tears in everyone's eyes.</font>

490
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,770
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it if you say you are confident to convince your mum,</font>

491
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,570
<font color="yellow">but I can't approve of it now.</font>

492
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,470
<font color="yellow">Don't sweat it and just end it here.</font>

493
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,840
<font color="yellow">He wants you to end it.</font>

494
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,900
<font color="yellow">It's natural for you to say so.</font>

495
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,670
<font color="yellow">I will marry Gab Soon no matter what.</font>

496
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,740
<font color="yellow">Please believe me.</font>

497
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,840
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

498
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,370
<font color="yellow">I told you that I'd be visiting your parents.</font>

499
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,770
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

500
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,840
<font color="yellow">Just trust me and follow my lead.</font>

501
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,500
<font color="yellow">Now that he makes money, it's different.</font>

502
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,140
<font color="yellow">Even when your parents were being so harsh on him,</font>

503
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,570
<font color="yellow">he didn't even move a muscle.</font>

504
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,540
<font color="yellow">He said he will marry you no matter what.</font>

505
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,100
<font color="yellow">Bring this to table number three.</font>

506
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,440
<font color="yellow">Mum. What brings you here?</font>

507
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,340
<font color="yellow">I came to help you.</font>

508
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

509
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,940
<font color="yellow">He came to deliver the beverage, and I asked him for help.</font>

510
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,670
<font color="yellow">What if rumour spreads?</font>

511
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,770
<font color="yellow">- What rumour? - People might misunderstand...</font>

512
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,300
<font color="yellow">that he's your pimp.</font>

513
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
<font color="yellow">Mum. It doesn't matter if rumour spreads or not.</font>

514
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,700
<font color="yellow">I don't care what people say. I should make him work.</font>

515
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,070
<font color="yellow">I'm here now, so you can go.</font>

516
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,340
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

517
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,900
<font color="yellow">Don't spend so much time with him.</font>

518
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,540
<font color="yellow">He only delivers water. What are you going to do with him?</font>

519
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
<font color="yellow">It's not what you think.</font>

520
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,470
<font color="yellow">How bad is it?</font>

521
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,040
<font color="yellow">I think I'm getting sick. I can't stand it any more.</font>

522
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,800
<font color="yellow">I need to take some medicine.</font>

523
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,470
<font color="yellow">You should quit working at the restaurant.</font>

524
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,470
<font color="yellow">Working at a restaurant is tough even for young people.</font>

525
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,140
<font color="yellow">There's no other way. I have to work.</font>

526
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,670
<font color="yellow">If I quit the job, no one will pay me anything.</font>

527
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,500
<font color="yellow">I thought you already had a plan for retirement.</font>

528
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
<font color="yellow">- What? - That's what you told me.</font>

529
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,900
<font color="yellow">You said you already have a plan,</font>

530
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,770
<font color="yellow">so we should only worry about ourselves.</font>

531
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,200
<font color="yellow">I thought about it, and I don't think I have enough money after all.</font>

532
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,800
<font color="yellow">I need more money if I'm going to live until I'm 100 years old.</font>

533
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,570
<font color="yellow">You said a million dollars is nothing.</font>

534
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,540
<font color="yellow">I need 100,000 dollars more.</font>

535
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,900
<font color="yellow">Do you even have 900,000 dollars?</font>

536
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,840
<font color="yellow">Mum, quit the job.</font>

537
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,140
<font color="yellow">I will make money and feed you.</font>

538
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,570
<font color="yellow">That's the last thing I want. No matter what happens,</font>

539
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,040
<font color="yellow">I will earn money for myself.</font>

540
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,040
<font color="yellow">You'd better work hard and pay off the debt.</font>

541
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,000
<font color="yellow">He said I could take my time.</font>

542
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,640
<font color="yellow">The later you pay, the more interest you will have.</font>

543
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,200
<font color="yellow">Did something happen at his place?</font>

544
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,440
<font color="yellow">I'd rather have you work at his place than at a restaurant.</font>

545
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,200
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say it's comfortable and nice there?</font>

546
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,740
<font color="yellow">Stop talking about that place. It's annoying.</font>

547
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,070
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

548
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,800
<font color="yellow">Did he say something?</font>

549
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,400
<font color="yellow">Those people don't even care about people like us.</font>

550
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,470
<font color="yellow">They probably hired someone else already.</font>

551
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,070
<font color="yellow">My gosh. My goodness.</font>

552
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,900
<font color="yellow">- Relief Patch. - Yes?</font>

553
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,370
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo!</font>

554
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,900
<font color="yellow">I got you.</font>

555
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,570
<font color="yellow">It's because you can't say you want to break up.</font>

556
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,740
<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself, so don't mind me.</font>

557
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,700
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo.</font>

558
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
<font color="yellow">I was passing by and just wanted to check how it's going here.</font>

559
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,900
<font color="yellow">It's going all right.</font>

560
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,640
<font color="yellow">I'm a little busy now because the store is opening soon.</font>

561
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,970
<font color="yellow">Have a seat here. I'll be done soon.</font>

562
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,670
<font color="yellow">Don't bother. I need to go somewhere.</font>

563
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,640
<font color="yellow">Have some chicken before you leave. I'll cook some for you.</font>

564
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,070
<font color="yellow">Everybody says it's tasty.</font>

565
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,300
<font color="yellow">Next time.</font>

566
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,370
<font color="yellow">Is your mother well?</font>

567
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,200
<font color="yellow">- No. - Why?</font>

568
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,200
<font color="yellow">Is she sick?</font>

569
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,700
<font color="yellow">She's working at a restaurant these days.</font>

570
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,410
<font color="yellow">She's sick,</font>

571
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,770
<font color="yellow">but she insists that she needs to prepare for her retirement.</font>

572
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,740
<font color="yellow">She's so stubborn.</font>

573
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,800
<font color="yellow">I remember her saying that she enjoyed nursing you.</font>

574
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,170
<font color="yellow">But I heard you have a new nurse now.</font>

575
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,540
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

576
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,170
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

577
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,700
<font color="yellow">Can my mum start working there again?</font>

578
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,800
<font color="yellow">We already hired someone, so I'm afraid that's not possible.</font>

579
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,740
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

580
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,410
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Mum? You're not working today, are you?</font>

581
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,570
<font color="yellow">I'm taking a day off because I'm sick.</font>

582
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,840
<font color="yellow">Why don't you come out and go on a date with me?</font>

583
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,270
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you dinner.</font>

584
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,670
<font color="yellow">Don't bother. You should save money.</font>

585
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,670
<font color="yellow">I want to introduce someone to you.</font>

586
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,410
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

587
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,910
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

588
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,540
<font color="yellow">No. I'm not going to meet you.</font>

589
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,440
<font color="yellow">Let's end this thing between us today.</font>

590
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,540
<font color="yellow">You must come. I'll text you where I am.</font>

591
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,440
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

592
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,100
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

593
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,240
<font color="yellow">I've never been to such a nice place in my life.</font>

594
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,940
<font color="yellow">Even the entrance looked really fancy.</font>

595
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,540
<font color="yellow">The customers looked really classy, too.</font>

596
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,200
<font color="yellow">Help yourself.</font>

597
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,570
<font color="yellow">How much is the meal?</font>

598
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,270
<font color="yellow">Is it about 100 dollars?</font>

599
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,000
<font color="yellow">It's not that expensive. Stop talking about money.</font>

600
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,140
<font color="yellow">I'll spend more time with you and take you to fancy places like this.</font>

601
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,340
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you delicious food and nice clothes.</font>

602
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,940
<font color="yellow">I'll also send you on trips.</font>

603
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,670
<font color="yellow">Hearing that makes me proud of you already.</font>

604
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,910
<font color="yellow">Mum, you had a tough life.</font>

605
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,500
<font color="yellow">Whenever you visited my school,</font>

606
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,410
<font color="yellow">you had to come directly from work.</font>

607
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,570
<font color="yellow">So when other mothers dressed up and looked nice...</font>

608
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,700
<font color="yellow">I would be wearing my work pants...</font>

609
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,410
<font color="yellow">and a shabby jacket.</font>

610
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,870
<font color="yellow">Back then, I used to be embarrassed of you.</font>

611
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,100
<font color="yellow">But now, it breaks my heart because you can't...</font>

612
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,100
<font color="yellow">live like they do.</font>

613
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,740
<font color="yellow">I'll be nicer to you.</font>

614
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,870
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you well.</font>

615
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,100
<font color="yellow">I don't ask for much.</font>

616
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,070
<font color="yellow">Just get married to a nice girl...</font>

617
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,040
<font color="yellow">and give me a grandchild. That's enough to make me happy.</font>

618
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,500
<font color="yellow">You said you're going to introduce me to her today.</font>

619
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's coming today.</font>

620
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,870
<font color="yellow">She said she fell in love with you at first sight.</font>

621
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,040
<font color="yellow">You guys must be meant for each other.</font>

622
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,840
<font color="yellow">You're both government officials, so you'll have a decent life.</font>

623
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,740
<font color="yellow">You'll receive a good amount of pension as well.</font>

624
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

625
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,570
<font color="yellow">Please grant me one wish.</font>

626
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,700
<font color="yellow">Could you let me choose whom I want to get married with?</font>

627
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,270
<font color="yellow">Then I'll do whatever you want me to do. I mean it.</font>

628
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,940
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

629
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,140
<font color="yellow">Is the girl you want to show me...</font>

630
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,440
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

631
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,240
<font color="yellow">It's Gab Soon.</font>

632
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,570
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

633
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,670
<font color="yellow">She's the girl you wanted to introduce me to?</font>

634
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,840
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you'd do something like this.</font>

635
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,410
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to hold onto a man like this?</font>

636
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,840
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's see who wins this game.</font>

637
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,170
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

638
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,670
<font color="yellow">She's right. I can't believe you'd do something like this.</font>

639
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,170
<font color="yellow">Did you think a sudden meeting like this would solve everything?</font>

640
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,000
<font color="yellow">Is this what you meant by solving things?</font>

641
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see that coming? You should've at least asked me.</font>

642
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,870
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to end this somehow.</font>

643
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
<font color="yellow">I thought they had to meet to come to a conclusion.</font>

644
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,270
<font color="yellow">It just became worse for you.</font>

645
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,370
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for your mother who's been trusting you the whole time.</font>

646
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,740
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Gab Soon as well.</font>

647
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,700
<font color="yellow">My mum doesn't know anything and wants me to learn from you.</font>

648
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,640
<font color="yellow">But I'm not sure what I can learn from you.</font>

649
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,200
<font color="yellow">This is so frustrating.</font>

650
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,840
<font color="yellow">Let's go drink.</font>

651
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,570
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

652
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,870
<font color="yellow">Can you please let it go just once?</font>

653
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,200
<font color="yellow">Your son is suffering so much.</font>

654
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,840
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

655
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,410
<font color="yellow">I can't leave Gab Soon. I can't break up with her.</font>

656
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,270
<font color="yellow">I promise that I'll treat you well.</font>

657
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,000
<font color="yellow">Could you please let it go just once?</font>

658
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,870
<font color="yellow">I'll be nice to you.</font>

659
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,740
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

660
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,070
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, Da Rong.</font>

664
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,410
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid this company isn't on the list.</font>

665
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it is. Could you check again?</font>

666
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,940
<font color="yellow">It's not on the list.</font>

667
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,570
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you made the final confirmation yesterday?</font>

668
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,870
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Yesterday?</font>

669
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't you check?</font>

670
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,300
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

671
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,410
<font color="yellow">I thought it was confirmed.</font>

672
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,800
<font color="yellow">We don't have enough booths, so we sent the emails again.</font>

673
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,940
<font color="yellow">Only those who replied to the email got invited.</font>

674
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,140
<font color="yellow">This is so unprofessional of you.</font>

675
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,100
<font color="yellow">It's not like you to make such a mistake.</font>

676
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,170
<font color="yellow">You know how important this expo is for us.</font>

677
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,270
<font color="yellow">It would've been a great chance to promote our products.</font>

678
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,340
<font color="yellow">You should've checked it yourself.</font>

679
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,800
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

680
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,600
<font color="yellow">I came here to make you some food.</font>

681
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,670
<font color="yellow">The kids just ate and went to study. Did you eat?</font>

682
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,140
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

683
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,040
<font color="yellow">No. I'm just tired.</font>

684
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,040
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

685
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,770
<font color="yellow">I can't help you, but it'll make you feel better.</font>

686
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,870
<font color="yellow">I'll get upset if you don't tell me.</font>

687
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,070
<font color="yellow">My work isn't going well.</font>

688
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,240
<font color="yellow">Be patient.</font>

689
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,170
<font color="yellow">I don't usually say this to anyone,</font>

690
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,200
<font color="yellow">but I have a feeling that things will work out well for you.</font>

691
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,500
<font color="yellow">I told you that you met my criteria.</font>

692
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,500
<font color="yellow">It's hard to satisfy the criteria.</font>

693
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,470
<font color="yellow">Actually, I didn't get a booth at the expo.</font>

694
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,470
<font color="yellow">I prepared everything, but I didn't do the final check last night.</font>

695
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,870
<font color="yellow">I'd be happy with just a small booth in the corner.</font>

696
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,140
<font color="yellow">Put your coat on.</font>

697
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

698
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,270
<font color="yellow">You can't be like this.</font>

699
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,700
<font color="yellow">You have to do your best until the end.</font>

700
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,670
<font color="yellow">You have to be tenacious. You're too mellow.</font>

701
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,700
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let's go.</font>

702
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

703
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,970
<font color="yellow">Mum, I'll be home late because of work.</font>

705
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,440
<font color="yellow">Are you really coming home late because of work?</font>

706
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,070
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm busy. I have to go.</font>

707
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,540
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

708

<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

709
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,800

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,270
<font color="yellow">You're still here?</font>

711
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,770
<font color="yellow">I told you that we're full. There aren't any booths left.</font>

712
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,000
<font color="yellow">That's why I asked you to do a final check.</font>

713
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,770

720
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,800
<font color="yellow">Just let us in. We can set it up really quickly.</font>

721
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,470
<font color="yellow">You persuaded me. You can go inside.</font>

722

727
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,700

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,070
<font color="yellow">I missed your cooking, Mother.</font>

746
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,840
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

747
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,000
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

748
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,470
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

749
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,740
<font color="yellow">Here it is.</font>

750
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,540
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Thank you so much.</font>

751
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,940
<font color="yellow">You're a big spender. You're so tall and handsome.</font>

752
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,400
<font color="yellow">What else?</font>

753
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,340
<font color="yellow">He has a big heart, too.</font>

754
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,140
<font color="yellow">You can stay and meet Jae Soon when she comes home.</font>

755
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,670
<font color="yellow">She should quit her job at the supermarket.</font>

756
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,000
<font color="yellow">She should.</font>

757
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,240
<font color="yellow">Father, let me pour you a glass.</font>

758
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,340
<font color="yellow">Who drinks during the day?</font>

759
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,470
<font color="yellow">Finish your meal and leave quickly.</font>

760
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,170
<font color="yellow">This isn't comfortable.</font>

761
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,470
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon's home. How long has it been since you've seen her?</font>

762
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,670
<font color="yellow">They never saw each other after the divorce.</font>

763
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,040
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

764
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,870
<font color="yellow">He's obviously eating.</font>

765
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,370
<font color="yellow">Se Bang's been waiting for you...</font>

766
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,370
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

767
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,870
<font color="yellow">She wants you to come out.</font>

768
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,870
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

769
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,700
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof.</font>

770
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,770
<font color="yellow">Why did you come to my place? You have no right.</font>

771
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,270
<font color="yellow">Don't be so cold. The weather's cold enough.</font>

772
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:59,040
<font color="yellow">Do I need a right? I just wanted to see Ddol Ee.</font>

773
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,800
<font color="yellow">You wanted to see Ddol Ee?</font>

774
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,540
<font color="yellow">I've been through so much after our divorce.</font>

775
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,200
<font color="yellow">You're shameless to show up here.</font>

776
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,540
<font color="yellow">I almost died repaying the debt you left me with.</font>

777
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,170
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

778
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,700
<font color="yellow">I know that he married you and paid off the debt.</font>

779
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,970
<font color="yellow">It broke my heart when I heard that.</font>

780
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,170
<font color="yellow">To think that you married someone you didn't love for money...</font>

781
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,470
<font color="yellow">It wasn't like that.</font>

782
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,500
<font color="yellow">You should've waited for me.</font>

783
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,140
<font color="yellow">You got divorced so soon because it was a forced marriage.</font>

784
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,870
<font color="yellow">You don't look like it, but you're quite short-tempered.</font>

785
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,540
<font color="yellow">You got divorced because of me, right?</font>

786
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,440
<font color="yellow">What kind of trash are you spitting out?</font>

787
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,400
<font color="yellow">You don't have to explain. I understand.</font>

788
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,800
<font color="yellow">Let's discuss our relationship slowly.</font>

789
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,200
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of Ddol Ee first.</font>

790
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,370
<font color="yellow">Move him to a different day care centre.</font>

791
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,700
<font color="yellow">Send him to an expensive one.</font>

792
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,670
<font color="yellow">I'll give you money.</font>

793
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,870
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I don't need it. Don't ever come back.</font>

794
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,840
<font color="yellow">- I'll take the responsibility. - You have no right.</font>

795
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,770
<font color="yellow">I'm his dad.</font>

796
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,200
<font color="yellow">What did you say in court when we got divorced?</font>

797
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,770
<font color="yellow">You said he wasn't your child.</font>

798
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,400
<font color="yellow">You said you won't pay for child support and you won't see him.</font>

799
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,400
<font color="yellow">I said that out of anger because you so desperately...</font>

800
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,540
<font color="yellow">wanted to get a divorce.</font>

801
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,440
<font color="yellow">Anyway, stop being angry.</font>

802
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,070
<font color="yellow">I have a legal right to see Ddol Ee.</font>

803
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,840
<font color="yellow">I now want to be a dad, a son-in-law...</font>

804
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,300
<font color="yellow">and a husband.</font>

805
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,670
<font color="yellow">Shut that mouth of yours.</font>

806
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
<font color="yellow">How can you let him in?</font>

807
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,870
<font color="yellow">You know what I've been through because of him.</font>

808
00:49:03,237 --> 00:49:05,937
<font color="yellow">How can you eat with him like nothing ever happened?</font>

809
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,200
<font color="yellow">I told him to leave several times.</font>

810
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I didn't kick him out.</font>

811
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:16,740
<font color="yellow">You know how he smooth he is with his words.</font>

812
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,070
<font color="yellow">He's Ddol Ee's dad. He has to come here to see his son.</font>

813
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,500
<font color="yellow">- Is it because of Geum Sik? - Mum.</font>

814
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,400
<font color="yellow">You should call him Mr Jo.</font>

815
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:30,800
<font color="yellow">Se Bang is better than Mr Jo in many ways.</font>

816
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,640
<font color="yellow">He's Ddol Ee's real father.</font>

817
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,600
<font color="yellow">This is how it's supposed to be.</font>

818
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,340
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

819
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
<font color="yellow">Do you think I have no brain?</font>

820
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,940
<font color="yellow">You don't need any other man.</font>

821
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,200
<font color="yellow">Your child's father is the best husband.</font>

822
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,770
<font color="yellow">I'm going to say this just once.</font>

823
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,270
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about him ever again.</font>

824
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,940
<font color="yellow">Is Jae Soon seeing Geum Sik?</font>

825
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,000
<font color="yellow">She didn't even like him before, but now, she's head over heels for him.</font>

826
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,000
<font color="yellow">She's having an affair...</font>

827
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,240
<font color="yellow">with Mr Jo.</font>

828
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,370
<font color="yellow">What's bothering you?</font>

829
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,170
<font color="yellow">- It's not normal, is it? - Your blood pressure isn't normal.</font>

830
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,340
<font color="yellow">Are you taking your medication?</font>

831
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,900
<font color="yellow">- Sometimes. - That's not good.</font>

832
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,300
<font color="yellow">You have to take it regularly and make sure not to get stressed.</font>

833
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,300
<font color="yellow">How is he?</font>

834
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,770
<font color="yellow">I'll have to monitor his blood pressure.</font>

835
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,300
<font color="yellow">Don't appoint Se Gye as the chief director.</font>

836
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,140
<font color="yellow">That's not right, Dad.</font>

837
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,170
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

838
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,070
<font color="yellow">Find him first, and we can discuss it then.</font>

839
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,340
<font color="yellow">Don't let Se Gye work on any important company work.</font>

840
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,940
<font color="yellow">Aren't you busy these days?</font>

841
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,170
<font color="yellow">I thought you were getting promoted.</font>

842
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,940
<font color="yellow">I turned it down.</font>

843
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,700
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I still have lots to learn.</font>

844
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,540
<font color="yellow">I don't know how businesses run.</font>

845
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,970
<font color="yellow">What would the employees think if I became the chief director?</font>

846
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,770
<font color="yellow">I'll learn first and transition slowly.</font>

847
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,140
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

848
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,500
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

849
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,170
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

850
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you like it? Try it on.</font>

851
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,100
<font color="yellow">It looks great on you. It's pretty.</font>

852
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,440
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this from?</font>

853
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,970
<font color="yellow">You couldn't have paid for it.</font>

854
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,770
<font color="yellow">Si Nae wanted to say sorry, so she got this for you.</font>

855
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,400
<font color="yellow">This didn't do anything wrong. Don't throw it.</font>

856
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,600
<font color="yellow">Give it back to her. I don't need it.</font>

857
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,370
<font color="yellow">Tell me what's wrong.</font>

858
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,240
<font color="yellow">- I need to know. - Ask her yourself.</font>

859
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,200
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

860
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,700
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

861
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,140
<font color="yellow">I was mistaken.</font>

862
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:32,700
<font color="yellow">It wasn't something serious.</font>

863
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,740
<font color="yellow">It wasn't something serious?</font>

864
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,370
<font color="yellow">I mean,</font>

865
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,470
<font color="yellow">it wasn't a big deal. I apologised.</font>

866
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,470
<font color="yellow">I bet my son has never been that humiliated in his life.</font>

867
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,400
<font color="yellow">Imagine how shameful and miserable he would have been.</font>

868
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,640
<font color="yellow">He had to undress himself at the police station...</font>

869
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,440
<font color="yellow">and got strip searched. He was treated like a thief.</font>

870
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,840
<font color="yellow">Imagine how...</font>

871
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,900
<font color="yellow">My son doesn't deserve to be treated like that.</font>

872
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,340
<font color="yellow">I'll leave change for the coffee.</font>

873
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,300
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

874
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,240
<font color="yellow">I was at my parents' house. I told you on the phone.</font>

875
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,700
<font color="yellow">Who were you with last time?</font>

876
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,170
<font color="yellow">That night when you drank.</font>

877
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,840
<font color="yellow">I told you I was with Gab Dol. It was because of Gab Soon.</font>

878
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,040
<font color="yellow">Weren't you with that woman?</font>

879
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
<font color="yellow">- Gong Joo. - What's between you two?</font>

880
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:36,500
<font color="yellow">She's just my friend from college.</font>

881
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,400
<font color="yellow">- Be honest with me. - I'm being honest.</font>

882
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,270
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this?</font>

883
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,100
<font color="yellow">I heard you two were planning to get married.</font>

884
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,170
<font color="yellow">And you tell me that she's just your friend?</font>

885
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,100
<font color="yellow">You thought I was a fool?</font>

886
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,870
<font color="yellow">I may be young, but I'm not a fool.</font>

887
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,670
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you this.</font>

888
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,700
<font color="yellow">How are things between you two now?</font>

889
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,740
<font color="yellow">You are not saying anything. I'll think whatever I want.</font>

890
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,440
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

891
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,800
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

892
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,940
<font color="yellow">I have something to say to you.</font>

893
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,340
<font color="yellow">Don't meet Se Gye. Don't even call him.</font>

894
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,570
<font color="yellow">Se Gye is a married man. I'm his wife.</font>

895
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,370
<font color="yellow">Please watch yourself.</font>

896
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,270
<font color="yellow">Eat.</font>

897
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,840
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

898
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,240
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You want to see Mum faint?</font>

899
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,700
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do with him?</font>

900
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,770
<font color="yellow">He's being so cold.</font>

901
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,940
<font color="yellow">He doesn't care about us at all.</font>

902
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,600
<font color="yellow">Leave him be. We'll see who wins.</font>

903
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,300
<font color="yellow">You haven't had breakfast, right?</font>

904
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,170
<font color="yellow">If you fast, you won't have any energy to work.</font>

905
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,870
<font color="yellow">I got lunch for you.</font>

906
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,500
<font color="yellow">Ms Kim.</font>

907
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,770
<font color="yellow">Do you have feelings for me?</font>

908
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,400
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - I have a girlfriend.</font>

909
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,300
<font color="yellow">We're going to get married soon.</font>

910
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your kindness,</font>

911
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,700
<font color="yellow">but I can't pay it back.</font>

912
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,440
<font color="yellow">I'll take the lunch just for today.</font>

913
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

914
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,500
<font color="yellow">Don't be nice to me from now on.</font>

915
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,940
<font color="yellow">My son doesn't deserve to be treated like that.</font>

916
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,940
<font color="yellow">Your son really can keep a secret.</font>

917
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,600
<font color="yellow">I guess you two are done, then.</font>

918
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,600
<font color="yellow">That's not the important part.</font>

919
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,170
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for my son.</font>

920
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,970
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for me, he wouldn't have been humiliated like that.</font>

921
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,770
<font color="yellow">I should tell him.</font>

922
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,440
<font color="yellow">What difference would it make?</font>

923
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,600
<font color="yellow">He won't have to suffer because of me.</font>

924
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,770
<font color="yellow">His life won't be any different.</font>

925
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,440
<font color="yellow">You must be mad at me. I'm sorry, Professor.</font>

926
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,370
<font color="yellow">Please, let me see your son one more time.</font>

927
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,440
<font color="yellow">I want to ask for his forgiveness.</font>

928
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,770
<font color="yellow">- Who is it? - The creditor.</font>

929
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,200
<font color="yellow">I thought you didn't have any debt.</font>

930
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,040
<font color="yellow">I might have no money, but I never borrowed any.</font>

931
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,470
<font color="yellow">That's incredible, you know.</font>

932
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,470
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go dancing?</font>

933
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,000
<font color="yellow">The atmosphere's great.</font>

934
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,770
<font color="yellow">There are women in their 40s to 80s.</font>

935
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,570
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

936
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,170
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

937
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,840
<font color="yellow">I'm going to a year-end party with my co-workers.</font>

938
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,100
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get back late?</font>

939
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,300
<font color="yellow">We'll have dinner and go to a karaoke. I might be a bit late.</font>

940
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,770
<font color="yellow">Are you really going with your co-workers?</font>

941
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,540
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

942
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:44,340
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving, Mum.</font>

943
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,070
<font color="yellow">Don't go out at night. Stay home.</font>

944
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,040
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? It's as if you're going on a date.</font>

945
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,200
<font color="yellow">It's something like that.</font>

946
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,570
<font color="yellow">- Are you seeing somebody? - That's not it.</font>

947
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,940
<font color="yellow">I'm getting suspicious.</font>

948
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,940
<font color="yellow">You look brighter these days.</font>

949
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,670
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

950
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,970
<font color="yellow">- Good luck, Dad. - What do you mean?</font>

951
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,400
<font color="yellow">I know everything.</font>

952
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,170
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

953
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,200
<font color="yellow">Good luck, Dad.</font>

954
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:23,800
<font color="yellow">My heart started pounding when you asked me out.</font>

955
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,970
<font color="yellow">I've never dated anybody.</font>

956
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,770
<font color="yellow">That's a lie.</font>

957
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,570
<font color="yellow">You're good at this.</font>

958
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:30,940
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

959
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,340
<font color="yellow">I got married both times right after going on a blind date.</font>

960
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,400
<font color="yellow">That's not something a lady should say.</font>

961
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,170
<font color="yellow">I wish it was snowing.</font>

962
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,070
<font color="yellow">Who do you think of when you open your eyes in the morning?</font>

963
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,000
<font color="yellow">My customers.</font>

964
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,170
<font color="yellow">Same here.</font>

965
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,000
<font color="yellow">When I open my eyes in the morning,</font>

966
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,270
<font color="yellow">I think about how many customers I'll get today.</font>

967
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,300
<font color="yellow">And then?</font>

968
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,240
<font color="yellow">The lady at the convenience store.</font>

969
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,200
<font color="yellow">She's weird.</font>

970
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,500
<font color="yellow">She always arranges the items different from how I want it.</font>

971
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,770
<font color="yellow">- And then? - And then...</font>

972
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,570
<font color="yellow">- The lady at the supermarket? - No.</font>

973
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,940
<font color="yellow">I think about the landlord who lives a level below me.</font>

974
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,270
<font color="yellow">She comes upstairs sometimes and yells at us.</font>

975
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,770
<font color="yellow">I need to save up so that we can move back to our old house.</font>

976
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,240
<font color="yellow">And then?</font>

977
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,240
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

978
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,770
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

979
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,870
<font color="yellow">Who do you think about, Jae Soon?</font>

980
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,040
<font color="yellow">I'm not telling.</font>

981
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:44,470
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

982
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:52,740
<font color="yellow">I do worry about somebody as soon as I wake up in the morning.</font>

983
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,700
<font color="yellow">I wonder if he's eating right or keeping warm.</font>

984
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,540
<font color="yellow">I wonder if it's difficult for him to start everything over again...</font>

985
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,470
<font color="yellow">and whether something's bothering him.</font>

986
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,170
<font color="yellow">It's as if he's a child.</font>

987
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,540
<font color="yellow">It saddens me.</font>

988
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,300
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake.</font>

989
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,570
<font color="yellow">I told you to give it to me. Give it to me now!</font>

990
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,600
<font color="yellow">I can't give it to you for free.</font>

991
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,340
<font color="yellow">I told you that I can't give it to you for free.</font>

992
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,470
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

993
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,040
<font color="yellow">Don't you know who I am?</font>

994
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,900
<font color="yellow">How would I know you?</font>

995
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,770
<font color="yellow">Pay me. It's 38 dollars.</font>

996
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,240
<font color="yellow">Look at this woman.</font>

997
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,770
<font color="yellow">Don't come near me. I'm going to kill both of us.</font>

998
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:58,270
<font color="yellow">You're busted. How dare you mess with me?</font>

999
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,570
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

1000
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:08,070
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! He hit me first.</font>

1001
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,040
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - You're back again.</font>

1002
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,270
<font color="yellow">He hit me!</font>

1003
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,800
<font color="yellow">He was threatening her with a beer bottle so I hit him to restrain him.</font>

1004
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,940
<font color="yellow">No, I hit him.</font>

1005
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,200
<font color="yellow">What's it called? When you protect yourself from an attacker?</font>

1006
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,100
<font color="yellow">- You mean self-defence? - Yes, that's what I did.</font>

1007
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,770
<font color="yellow">He wasn't the one who hit him.</font>

1008
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,640
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

1009
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,940
<font color="yellow">When are you ever going to stop?</font>

1010
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,270
<font color="yellow">He goes around to restaurants where there's only women.</font>

1011
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,470
<font color="yellow">You can give your testimony and go.</font>

1012
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,200
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. You can go home first.</font>

1013
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,140
<font color="yellow">My restaurant's a mess.</font>

1014
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,440
<font color="yellow">I have to clean up for tomorrow.</font>

1015
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,300
<font color="yellow">I'll clean up after leaving here.</font>

1016
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,800
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

1017
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,100
<font color="yellow">I'll leave it to you.</font>

1018
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,670
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Should we eat something?</font>

1019
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,640
<font color="yellow">Let's go there.</font>

1020
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,800
<font color="yellow">Okay. It's on me.</font>

1021
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,270
<font color="yellow">Let's invite your landlord to eat with us.</font>

1022
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,540
<font color="yellow">Madam, would you like to go on a date? I'll buy you chicken.</font>

1023
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:32,340
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine.</font>

1024
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,770
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I can do it.</font>

1025
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,440
<font color="yellow">- That hurts. - It was supposed to.</font>

1026
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,800
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

1027
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

1028
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,840
<font color="yellow">Sit here. I just have to clean up this side.</font>

1029
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,240
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

1030
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,240
<font color="yellow">How's draft beer and chicken?</font>
