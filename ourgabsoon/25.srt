155
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:00,884
<font color="yellow">It's over now.</font>

156
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:03,584
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

157
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:07,124
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

158
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:19,014
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to work?</font>

159
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,954
<font color="yellow">I can't go. I'm sick.</font>

160
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:23,384
<font color="yellow">Why are you sick so suddenly?</font>

161
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,954
<font color="yellow">You delivered milk just fine this morning.</font>

162
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,124
<font color="yellow">Go to the hospital if you're sick.</font>

163
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:45,014
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

164
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:46,754
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

165
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:49,854
<font color="yellow">You left your jump rope behind.</font>

166
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,184
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

167
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,584
<font color="yellow">Come home early. I will make delicious food for you.</font>

168
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,284
<font color="yellow">Is Ms Nam still not here?</font>

169
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:15,184
<font color="yellow">I wonder if something happened.</font>

170
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:16,784
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

171
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:21,784
<font color="yellow">- Ms Nam. - I'm sorry.</font>

172
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,954
<font color="yellow">I wanted to go to work,</font>

173
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:26,914
<font color="yellow">but I have severe body ache.</font>

174
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:29,784
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can work today. I'm sorry.</font>

175
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:32,314
<font color="yellow">If you can't work, you need to tell us in advance.</font>

176
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,554
<font color="yellow">How can you just tell us now?</font>

177
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,124
<font color="yellow">Can't she come today?</font>

178
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:39,814
<font color="yellow">I'm so annoyed. She has body ache.</font>

179
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:42,084
<font color="yellow">We have guests coming. What am I going to do?</font>

180
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,624
<font color="yellow">How can you get sick without any notice?</font>

181
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,714
<font color="yellow">Who plans to get sick?</font>

182
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,484
<font color="yellow">Let's see when you get old. Also, why are you inviting guests?</font>

183
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,054
<font color="yellow">Don't ever invite anyone from now on.</font>

184
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:55,484
<font color="yellow">Why shove around someone that's already struggling to look after me?</font>

185
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,884
<font color="yellow">She doesn't do anything. You don't even go to the hospital.</font>

186
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:01,684
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how much we pay for her?</font>

187
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:04,284
<font color="yellow">What? Stop meddling.</font>

188
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,054
<font color="yellow">It's my money, not yours.</font>

189
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:07,914
<font color="yellow">Listen to me while you live in this house!</font>

190
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:29,654
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

191
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:33,484
<font color="yellow">- Don't drink too much. - Okay.</font>

192
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,654
<font color="yellow">If you're ill, get up and go to the hospital.</font>

193
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:22,214
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Can you walk or not?</font>

194
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:25,084
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Just answer me.</font>

195
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:26,384
<font color="yellow">Can you walk or not?</font>

196
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,114
<font color="yellow">- I can walk. - Then come out.</font>

197
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:39,084
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

198
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:40,314
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

199
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:01,454
<font color="yellow">Eat.</font>

200
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,684
<font color="yellow">- Well... - Don't say anything and eat now.</font>

201
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:06,284
<font color="yellow">Let's talk after this.</font>

202
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:17,014
<font color="yellow">It's hot. Blow it before you eat.</font>

203
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:23,354
<font color="yellow">Cheer up with this food. Don't get sick.</font>

204
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:32,014
<font color="yellow">Why, did I do something wrong?</font>

205
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:35,554
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying, then?</font>

206
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:40,884
<font color="yellow">I'm touched.</font>

207
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,684
<font color="yellow">Up until now,</font>

208
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,384
<font color="yellow">I wondered who'd care about me this much...</font>

209
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,384
<font color="yellow">since my husband died.</font>

210
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:56,354
<font color="yellow">There was nobody that took care of me like you did.</font>

211
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:00,814
<font color="yellow">Even though I have two children,</font>

212
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,684
<font color="yellow">neither of them cooked for me even if I was ill.</font>

213
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,784
<font color="yellow">No one touched me, either.</font>

214
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,384
<font color="yellow">All they do is to tell me to go see a doctor.</font>

215
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:13,784
<font color="yellow">Children are...</font>

216
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:16,484
<font color="yellow">all the same.</font>

217
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:20,214
<font color="yellow">In the last 20 years,</font>

218
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:24,054
<font color="yellow">no guy has ever treated me to a meal.</font>

219
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:27,384
<font color="yellow">I'm all old.</font>

220
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,854
<font color="yellow">Nobody would care this much about me.</font>

221
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:37,314
<font color="yellow">You care about my meals,</font>

222
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,154
<font color="yellow">and you care about my illness.</font>

223
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:47,654
<font color="yellow">I'm all old. Nobody would care about me like you do.</font>

224
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:52,614
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch,</font>

225
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:56,614
<font color="yellow">look at me.</font>

226
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,614
<font color="yellow">Let me just say...</font>

227
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,954
<font color="yellow">one thing only.</font>

228
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,684
<font color="yellow">I don't know how long I will live,</font>

229
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,954
<font color="yellow">but until the day I'm intact,</font>

230
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:15,014
<font color="yellow">I'll look after you.</font>

231
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:16,754
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

232
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:24,184
<font color="yellow">I've never heard of such thing since I was born.</font>

233
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:29,054
<font color="yellow">I only thought I'd need to look after others.</font>

234
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:31,554
<font color="yellow">I never considered myself...</font>

235
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:36,084
<font color="yellow">as someone who needs to be taken care of.</font>

236
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:44,584
<font color="yellow">I didn't say that to make you cry.</font>

237
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:47,514
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

238
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:52,354
<font color="yellow">for making me realise that I'm still alive.</font>

239
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:57,784
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming to my life.</font>

240
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,314
<font color="yellow">Besides,</font>

241
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,584
<font color="yellow">don't tell me that I'm old.</font>

242
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:05,954
<font color="yellow">You're just like a kid to me, so stop acting up.</font>

243
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,214
<font color="yellow">Eat with rice.</font>

244
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:25,184
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Gosh.</font>

245
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:31,654
<font color="yellow">Have some.</font>

246
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:35,154
<font color="yellow">Chungcheong Province?</font>

247
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:38,784
<font color="yellow">Go there for a couple of days. You have many friends there.</font>

248
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:41,354
<font color="yellow">I was actually planning to go there.</font>

249
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,714
<font color="yellow">How did you read my mind?</font>

250
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:45,484
<font color="yellow">No need to party.</font>

251
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:51,654
<font color="yellow">Here's some money for your ride. Go eat something with your friends.</font>

252
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:56,584
<font color="yellow">I'll be all dignified thanks to you.</font>

253
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:00,284
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon, you seem fishy.</font>

254
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:03,084
<font color="yellow">No need for suspicion. It's to make you not feel so lonely.</font>

255
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,484
<font color="yellow">I was getting lonely with the cold weather.</font>

256
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:12,554
<font color="yellow">- Go back home. - I'll see you get on the bus.</font>

257
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:13,984
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

258
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,954
<font color="yellow">- Mal Nyeon, - Yes?</font>

259
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:18,654
<font color="yellow">- Don't get sick. - I won't.</font>

260
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:21,954
<font color="yellow">- You do the same. - Yes, hopefully.</font>

261
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,714
<font color="yellow">- Be safe. - Okay.</font>

262
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:30,324
<font color="yellow">Goodbye. Don't argue with Nae Shim.</font>

263
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:33,554
<font color="yellow">If she nags, avoid her. I'll teach her a big lesson once I'm back.</font>

264
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:35,354
<font color="yellow">All right, please do.</font>

265
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,324
<font color="yellow">- Go. - Goodbye.</font>

266
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,384
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

267
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:02,284
<font color="yellow">- Did Mal Nyeon go? - She did.</font>

268
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:05,484
<font color="yellow">Turn that off.</font>

269
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,684
<font color="yellow">Why? Would it take long?</font>

270
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:11,384
<font color="yellow">You been dying to talk to me for quite a while. Go on.</font>

271
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:13,614
<font color="yellow">There's nobody home, so proceed.</font>

272
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:23,184
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

273
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,884
<font color="yellow">(Divorce Application Form)</font>

274
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:32,784
<font color="yellow">I've already filled out everything.</font>

275
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,214
<font color="yellow">Just sign the papers.</font>

276
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:41,654
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

277
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:44,654
<font color="yellow">I wish I was.</font>

278
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,614
<font color="yellow">Let's get a divorce.</font>

279
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:50,354
<font color="yellow">How could you suggest a divorce to me?</font>

280
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:54,154
<font color="yellow">You are so brazen.</font>

281
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,384
<font color="yellow">I should be the one to demand a divorce.</font>

282
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:59,324
<font color="yellow">Did you suggest it because you were afraid I'd do so?</font>

283
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,384
<font color="yellow">- Pretend you suggested it, then. - What's the reason?</font>

284
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:04,554
<font color="yellow">I'd like to hear it.</font>

285
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:09,554
<font color="yellow">I'd like to hear why I should let you divorce me.</font>

286
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:13,554
<font color="yellow">There are hundreds of reasons why I should divorce you,</font>

287
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:16,584
<font color="yellow">but how dare you suggest one to me?</font>

288
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:18,484
<font color="yellow">Ask others on the street.</font>

289
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:21,714
<font color="yellow">You're right. Everything you say is right.</font>

290
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,254
<font color="yellow">You should be the one to divorce me.</font>

291
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:28,954
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry if I hurt your pride by giving you the papers first.</font>

292
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:33,354
<font color="yellow">I can no longer live with you.</font>

293
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,754
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

294
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:36,984
<font color="yellow">It's not because you did something wrong.</font>

295
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:39,384
<font color="yellow">We just don't get along.</font>

296
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:40,654
<font color="yellow">Since when did you think about this?</font>

297
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,684
<font color="yellow">Since when did you prepare to get a divorce?</font>

298
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,324
<font color="yellow">- I've never prepared one. - Then what's wrong?</font>

299
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,614
<font color="yellow">When you threw away my stuff,</font>

300
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:52,884
<font color="yellow">I made up my mind.</font>

301
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:55,484
<font color="yellow">That's how you look at me.</font>

302
00:19:56,284 --> 00:20:00,324
<font color="yellow">That's how you treat your husband with whom you lived for 40 years.</font>

303
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,014
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

304
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:06,154
<font color="yellow">Are you suggesting a divorce because of that?</font>

305
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:10,284
<font color="yellow">You must be out of your mind! It's just trash!</font>

306
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:12,284
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

307
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,514
<font color="yellow">You consider me as garbage.</font>

308
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,954
<font color="yellow">That's why we don't work.</font>

309
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,954
<font color="yellow">Stop with your nonsense!</font>

310
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,254
<font color="yellow">Call the kids and ask if this makes any sense.</font>

311
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:25,324
<font color="yellow">It's a problem between us. Leave the kids out of this.</font>

312
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:28,714
<font color="yellow">Let's stop arguing.</font>

313
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:33,384
<font color="yellow">I'm not confident enough to live with you until 100 years old.</font>

314
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:35,914
<font color="yellow">Do you think I want to live with you?</font>

315
00:20:36,054 --> 00:20:39,714
<font color="yellow">I was going to suggest it anyway. Let's get a divorce!</font>

316
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:45,084
<font color="yellow">Our current assets,</font>

317
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:49,714
<font color="yellow">a number of insurances...</font>

318
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:53,614
<font color="yellow">and this house are the only things that's worthy.</font>

319
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:57,384
<font color="yellow">The one we saved for our retirement.</font>

320
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:01,084
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, we have this house.</font>

321
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:03,954
<font color="yellow">We even asked our son for living expenses.</font>

322
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:05,584
<font color="yellow">Still we kept this place.</font>

323
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:08,824
<font color="yellow">I was the breadwinner,</font>

324
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:10,854
<font color="yellow">but you protected the house.</font>

325
00:21:11,514 --> 00:21:12,754
<font color="yellow">So let's divide the money in half.</font>

326
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:17,324
<font color="yellow">I'll be down in Sokcho.</font>

327
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:20,324
<font color="yellow">I'll tell the kids about it.</font>

328
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,754
<font color="yellow">You don't have anything to say, do you?</font>

329
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,014
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you have something to say?</font>

330
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:58,554
<font color="yellow">You realised you went overboard, right?</font>

331
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:01,314
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth. For how long have you been planning for this?</font>

332
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:03,884
<font color="yellow">Since when did you decide to divorce me?</font>

333
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,914
<font color="yellow">I told you when.</font>

334
00:23:06,054 --> 00:23:07,384
<font color="yellow">I don't believe it!</font>

335
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,614
<font color="yellow">That can't be a reason to get a divorce.</font>

336
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:12,654
<font color="yellow">You planned this behind my back.</font>

337
00:23:12,914 --> 00:23:15,454
<font color="yellow">You should have at least given me a hint.</font>

338
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:17,614
<font color="yellow">How can you drop a bomb like this?</font>

339
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:19,514
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

340
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:40,814
<font color="yellow">Divide our assets in half?</font>

341
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:43,154
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense!</font>

342
00:23:43,454 --> 00:23:44,454
<font color="yellow">What is nonsense?</font>

343
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:46,354
<font color="yellow">Why don't you count your severance pay?</font>

344
00:23:46,614 --> 00:23:48,054
<font color="yellow">You lost that money,</font>

345
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:50,014
<font color="yellow">so we can't divide this house in half.</font>

346
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:52,584
<font color="yellow">We have to count the money you lost.</font>

347
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:54,314
<font color="yellow">So I'll take 70 percent.</font>

348
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:55,854
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

349
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,184
<font color="yellow">Let's go by the law.</font>

350
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:02,754
<font color="yellow">The law? Did you say, "Let's go by the law"?</font>

351
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:04,454
<font color="yellow">Let's not fight.</font>

352
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:06,884
<font color="yellow">Let's have a nice divorce.</font>

353
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,754
<font color="yellow">Getting angry will only give you more wrinkles.</font>

354
00:24:10,154 --> 00:24:11,184
<font color="yellow">Go to your room.</font>

355
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,914
<font color="yellow">You got a mistress?</font>

356
00:24:38,614 --> 00:24:40,084
<font color="yellow">You should know better.</font>

357
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,684
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't do this if you don't have one!</font>

358
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:44,454
<font color="yellow">Of course I would.</font>

359
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,584
<font color="yellow">I have to pack.</font>

360
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:52,754
<font color="yellow">Hey! Shin Joong Nyeon! Open the door!</font>

361
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:54,084
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

362
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:57,014
<font color="yellow">Open the door! Are you going to be like this?</font>

363
00:24:57,614 --> 00:24:59,754
<font color="yellow">Don't stab me in the back like this!</font>

364
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:00,854
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

365
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:34,454
<font color="yellow">Please sell it as soon as you can.</font>

366
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:37,514
<font color="yellow">I'm willing to go down in price if there's a suitable buyer.</font>

367
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,584
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

368
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:46,354
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi, Gab Dol.</font>

369
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,184
<font color="yellow">Congratulations. I heard the news.</font>

370
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:51,384
<font color="yellow">Great job.</font>

371
00:25:51,754 --> 00:25:52,754
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

372
00:25:53,314 --> 00:25:55,354
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute. Shall we...</font>

373
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,354
<font color="yellow">get some tea?</font>

374
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:04,914
<font color="yellow">Did you break up with Gab Soon?</font>

375
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,084
<font color="yellow">- No. - Did you have a fight?</font>

376
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:10,484
<font color="yellow">We didn't. We had a misunderstanding.</font>

377
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:13,614
<font color="yellow">You two seem a little distant.</font>

378
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:18,784
<font color="yellow">You don't have plans to get married, do you?</font>

379
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,754
<font color="yellow">Well, you just passed the exam.</font>

380
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:25,054
<font color="yellow">It'll take you some time to get settled.</font>

381
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,084
<font color="yellow">You also have your mother.</font>

382
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:33,084
<font color="yellow">Marrying Gab Soon will be hard, won't it?</font>

383
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,454
<font color="yellow">She gave up on the teacher employment exam.</font>

384
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,684
<font color="yellow">She's trying to start a cleaning business.</font>

385
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,454
<font color="yellow">I put this house up for sale.</font>

386
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:06,384
<font color="yellow">I asked the realtor to sell it as fast as he could.</font>

387
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:37,984
<font color="yellow">I cooked this rice. You cook your own.</font>

388
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:56,484
<font color="yellow">(Cleaning Report)</font>

389
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:26,884
<font color="yellow">I'm here to work.</font>

390
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:29,584
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

391
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,554
<font color="yellow">I got some groceries.</font>

392
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:33,684
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and cook. Dad is hungry.</font>

393
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:34,884
<font color="yellow">I'm not hungry.</font>

394
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:37,914
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so rude to her?</font>

395
00:28:38,114 --> 00:28:40,014
<font color="yellow">She's much older than you.</font>

396
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:42,584
<font color="yellow">This is why she doesn't respect me.</font>

397
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:43,914
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even call me "Ma'am".</font>

398
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:45,384
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

399
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:47,254
<font color="yellow">Why are you demanding respect?</font>

400
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:49,514
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ma'am. I won't be late next time.</font>

401
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:53,384
<font color="yellow">I'm already so upset. Why does she have to make it worse?</font>

402
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:56,384
<font color="yellow">What does she have to do with you being upset?</font>

403
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,254
<font color="yellow">Dad, why are you doing this to me?</font>

404
00:29:04,184 --> 00:29:05,484
<font color="yellow">Don't take it to heart.</font>

405
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:08,714
<font color="yellow">I'll scold her one day.</font>

406
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:11,614
<font color="yellow">Don't be so obvious.</font>

407
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:13,584
<font color="yellow">I'm really nervous.</font>

408
00:29:13,814 --> 00:29:16,254
<font color="yellow">What if I'm obvious? What are they going to do?</font>

409
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:18,154
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't.</font>

410
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:37,554
<font color="yellow">Go to Cho Rong and beg.</font>

411
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:40,214
<font color="yellow">You should apologise if you did something wrong.</font>

412
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:44,584
<font color="yellow">You put her through so much. Don't you feel sorry for her?</font>

413
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:46,454
<font color="yellow">How can you call yourself her mum?</font>

414
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:03,184
<font color="yellow">I didn't forget anything.</font>

415
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:06,114
<font color="yellow">I know what you did to us.</font>

416
00:30:06,984 --> 00:30:09,184
<font color="yellow">We are like this because of you.</font>

417
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,354
<font color="yellow">I raised Da Rong.</font>

418
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:12,954
<font color="yellow">Don't show up again.</font>

419
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,114
<font color="yellow">Kids, snack time.</font>

420
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:21,484
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

421
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,114
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

422
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:31,654
<font color="yellow">How's A Young? She isn't coming home these days.</font>

423
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:33,254
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you?</font>

424
00:30:33,754 --> 00:30:36,014
<font color="yellow">She flew to Europe. She'll be back next week.</font>

425
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:40,514
<font color="yellow">- This is delicious. - I envy her.</font>

426
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,654
<font color="yellow">She goes overseas all the time.</font>

427
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,254
<font color="yellow">It's no fun if it's for business.</font>

428
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:47,484
<font color="yellow">Let's go together once I take care of some work.</font>

429
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:48,814
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Sure.</font>

430
00:30:58,154 --> 00:30:59,614
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy for attention?</font>

431
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,614
<font color="yellow">I know your face. You're dead meat.</font>

432
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:02,984
<font color="yellow">You'll never get married to the rich.</font>

433
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:04,084
<font color="yellow">Don't lie.</font>

434
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:06,514
<font color="yellow">Do you still have that bad habit from high school?</font>

435
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:07,954
<font color="yellow">You're a serious liar!</font>

436
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:23,584
<font color="yellow">I just fell for you at first sight.</font>

437
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:26,614
<font color="yellow">- Can I join you? - No need.</font>

438
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:28,614
<font color="yellow">Allow me, all right?</font>

439
00:31:31,814 --> 00:31:34,584
<font color="yellow">It's annoying. I'll just get married to you.</font>

440
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:36,614
<font color="yellow">If you act like this, I'll really marry you.</font>

441
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:41,084
<font color="yellow">Who's that guy? Do you want me to take care of him?</font>

442
00:31:41,184 --> 00:31:42,584
<font color="yellow">Don't get beaten instead.</font>

443
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:45,454
<font color="yellow">- Where did you come from? - I was at work.</font>

444
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:48,684
<font color="yellow">I always rush like a loyal dog whenever you call me.</font>

445
00:31:52,314 --> 00:31:54,254
<font color="yellow">I can't go back home.</font>

446
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,254
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

447
00:31:58,384 --> 00:31:59,454
<font color="yellow">Don't mind.</font>

448
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,384
<font color="yellow">Do you have any rich friends...</font>

449
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,184
<font color="yellow">or someone like that around you?</font>

450
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:07,014
<font color="yellow">I sometimes meet the rich people because of work.</font>

451
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:09,814
<font color="yellow">Did you get dumped by a rich guy?</font>

452
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,154
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

453
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:53,884
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dal Po.</font>

454
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:56,814
<font color="yellow">If you were from the rich family,</font>

455
00:32:57,254 --> 00:33:00,484
<font color="yellow">I would have married you long ago.</font>

456
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:30,724
<font color="yellow">Do you like me?</font>

457
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,084
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you something.</font>

458
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:37,724
<font color="yellow">Don't like someone like me.</font>

<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

611
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:52,384
<font color="yellow">- Clean them up. - Okay.</font>

612
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:06,314
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you. Spare me a minute.</font>

613
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:10,784
<font color="yellow">I'll wait outside.</font>

614
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:17,654
<font color="yellow">Clean that spot.</font>

615
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:29,854
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

616
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:33,014
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

617
00:46:34,454 --> 00:46:35,714
<font color="yellow">Did you come to see Gab Soon?</font>

618
00:46:45,714 --> 00:46:46,784
<font color="yellow">You didn't have lunch, did you?</font>

619
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:49,784
<font color="yellow">I bought plenty of them.</font>

620
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:51,654
<font color="yellow">Eat some if you want.</font>

621
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:53,154
<font color="yellow">No, thanks.</font>

622
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,614
<font color="yellow">Sushi delivery.</font>

623
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:00,954
<font color="yellow">He brought sushi.</font>

624
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:03,884
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon's boyfriend is nice.</font>

625
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:23,384
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

626
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,054
<font color="yellow">I don't need a special excuse to see you.</font>

627
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:29,454
<font color="yellow">I came to visit you because you're busy.</font>

628
00:47:31,814 --> 00:47:35,014
<font color="yellow">Last time, it was definitely Da Hae's fault.</font>

629
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,614
<font color="yellow">I even beat her up.</font>

630
00:47:38,184 --> 00:47:41,154
<font color="yellow">Though she's my child, I get upset about her. No wonder you do.</font>

631
00:47:41,654 --> 00:47:43,984
<font color="yellow">Can't you forgive her just for once?</font>

632
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,484
<font color="yellow">It's not me but our kids. They don't want to see her.</font>

633
00:47:47,084 --> 00:47:48,884
<font color="yellow">- Geum Sik. - Mother.</font>

634
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:53,684
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to say this but please don't come here any more.</font>

635
00:47:54,254 --> 00:47:55,784
<font color="yellow">I feel uncomfortable to see you.</font>

636
00:47:56,314 --> 00:47:58,084
<font color="yellow">How could you say that?</font>

637
00:47:58,814 --> 00:48:01,954
<font color="yellow">I know you are angry but you have to think of your children.</font>

638
00:48:01,954 --> 00:48:03,354
<font color="yellow">I do think of my children.</font>

639
00:48:04,154 --> 00:48:06,984
<font color="yellow">She hurt their feelings and they don't want to see her now.</font>

640
00:48:07,814 --> 00:48:08,884
<font color="yellow">I'm also heartbroken.</font>

641
00:48:08,984 --> 00:48:10,554
<font color="yellow">Even so, how could you...</font>

642
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:14,084
<font color="yellow">sever all the ties like this? This is too harsh.</font>

643
00:48:14,454 --> 00:48:17,114
<font color="yellow">Even if Da Hae made a terrible mistake, this is not right.</font>

644
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,114
<font color="yellow">How can you break the family relationship?</font>

645
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:22,384
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong is upset now...</font>

646
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:25,254
<font color="yellow">but I bet she'll get back to her mum later.</font>

647
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:27,484
<font color="yellow">Adults should keep the door open.</font>

648
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,284
<font color="yellow">You can't shut it like this.</font>

649
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:32,884
<font color="yellow">Did your wife lure you to do that?</font>

650
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:37,314
<font color="yellow">She is such a nice and kind woman.</font>

651
00:48:37,954 --> 00:48:39,984
<font color="yellow">Don't get involved in my family matter.</font>

652
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:41,214
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

653
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:44,984
<font color="yellow">Did you add her son to your family register?</font>

654
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:56,814
<font color="yellow">You idiot, why on earth did you do such a thing?</font>

655
00:48:57,884 --> 00:48:58,884
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

656
00:48:58,884 --> 00:49:01,084
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik says he added her son to his family register.</font>

657
00:49:01,554 --> 00:49:02,814
<font color="yellow">You should've known better.</font>

658
00:49:03,314 --> 00:49:06,154
<font color="yellow">You made your children and Geum Sik turn away from you.</font>

659
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:07,384
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

660
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,384
<font color="yellow">Did he get her son registered?</font>

661
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:12,684
<font color="yellow">He said he'd take care of his own family and told me not to come.</font>

662
00:49:19,654 --> 00:49:21,014
<font color="yellow">I should have left earlier.</font>

663
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:24,054
<font color="yellow">Don't hurry and be careful when you're driving.</font>

664
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:29,214
<font color="yellow">I'll go on a business trip.</font>

665
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:35,454
<font color="yellow">- When are you coming back? - Tomorrow.</font>

666
00:49:36,484 --> 00:49:38,484
<font color="yellow">Take care of your sister and brother.</font>

667
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:42,214
<font color="yellow">Da Rong, take care.</font>

668
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:43,984
<font color="yellow">Daddy, what about presents?</font>

669
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:45,384
<font color="yellow">Presents?</font>

670
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:47,184
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

671
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,084
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, you take care, too.</font>

672
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:54,784
<font color="yellow">- Honey, you might be late. - I'll call you.</font>

673
00:49:56,354 --> 00:49:57,884
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Dad. - Bye.</font>

674
00:49:57,884 --> 00:49:58,914
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

675
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:04,654
<font color="yellow">Get inside now.</font>

676
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:06,084
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to hug me?</font>

677
00:50:06,514 --> 00:50:07,684
<font color="yellow">You only hugged the kids.</font>

678
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:15,254
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

679
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:17,914
<font color="yellow">Drive safely.</font>

680
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:23,954
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

681
00:50:42,954 --> 00:50:44,284
<font color="yellow">He's not here.</font>

682
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:45,884
<font color="yellow">He left for a business trip a while ago.</font>

683
00:50:47,684 --> 00:50:48,914
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

684
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:01,884
<font color="yellow">They'll all burn out.</font>

685
00:51:18,354 --> 00:51:19,914
<font color="yellow">I called the kids to come over.</font>

686
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:23,184
<font color="yellow">- What for? - We need to tell them.</font>

687
00:51:25,954 --> 00:51:26,984
<font color="yellow">I told you...</font>

688
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:31,014
<font color="yellow">to come over because...</font>

689
00:51:35,214 --> 00:51:36,754
<font color="yellow">we are...</font>

690
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:39,854
<font color="yellow">We will be separated for a while.</font>

691
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:41,754
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Why?</font>

692
00:51:41,854 --> 00:51:43,014
<font color="yellow">- Is there something wrong? - Is there something wrong?</font>

693
00:51:44,954 --> 00:51:48,654
<font color="yellow">Your dad wanted to go to Sokcho, so I told him to do so.</font>

694
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,214
<font color="yellow">There's nothing he can do at home anyway.</font>

695
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:53,714
<font color="yellow">She's right.</font>

696
00:51:54,754 --> 00:51:56,814
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to do in Seoul.</font>

697
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:00,354
<font color="yellow">It was nice when I visited there last time.</font>

698
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:03,814
<font color="yellow">The air is fresh, and I can sometimes go on a boat.</font>

699
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:05,314
<font color="yellow">It's better than Seoul.</font>

700
00:52:05,984 --> 00:52:07,114
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

701
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:10,484
<font color="yellow">I agree. Mum goes to gatherings with her friends,</font>

702
00:52:10,484 --> 00:52:13,384
<font color="yellow">but you always stay at home. I'm glad to hear that.</font>

703
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:17,614
<font color="yellow">Good. He'll catch some fish once in a while.</font>

704
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:19,784
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

705
00:52:21,184 --> 00:52:23,054
<font color="yellow">I'll come back about twice a month,</font>

706
00:52:23,814 --> 00:52:24,884
<font color="yellow">so keep that in mind.</font>

707
00:52:24,884 --> 00:52:28,154
<font color="yellow">No need to waste money. You can come back twice a year.</font>

708
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:30,284
<font color="yellow">I also have something to show you.</font>

709
00:52:31,384 --> 00:52:33,384
<font color="yellow">Surprise! Dad, look.</font>

710
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:35,984
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

711
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,214
<font color="yellow">Envelopes scare me.</font>

712
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:40,614
<font color="yellow">(Business Licence)</font>

713
00:52:40,614 --> 00:52:42,554
<font color="yellow">It's a business licence.</font>

714
00:52:42,854 --> 00:52:44,084
<font color="yellow">Have you already registered it?</font>

715
00:52:44,214 --> 00:52:46,514
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm a president of my company now.</font>

716
00:52:46,784 --> 00:52:48,084
<font color="yellow">I almost cried.</font>

717
00:52:48,454 --> 00:52:49,554
<font color="yellow">Mum, take a look.</font>

718
00:52:49,554 --> 00:52:51,784
<font color="yellow">Forget it. It's just a cleaning company.</font>

719
00:52:54,984 --> 00:52:56,014
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

720
00:52:56,154 --> 00:52:58,014
<font color="yellow">Shin Gab Soon, the president.</font>

721
00:52:58,154 --> 00:53:00,754
<font color="yellow">You're the first president of our family.</font>

722
00:53:01,384 --> 00:53:02,454
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

723
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:04,554
<font color="yellow">You're successful now.</font>

724
00:53:05,054 --> 00:53:07,054
<font color="yellow">Sparkly Clean Gab Soon.</font>

725
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:08,154
<font color="yellow">I like the name.</font>

726
00:53:08,154 --> 00:53:09,784
<font color="yellow">You've now registered your company.</font>

727
00:53:10,184 --> 00:53:12,714
<font color="yellow">You're the first president of our family.</font>

728
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:14,984
<font color="yellow">Do your best.</font>

729
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:16,754
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

730
00:53:16,854 --> 00:53:19,214
<font color="yellow">Don't show this kind of stuff to Mum.</font>

731
00:53:19,214 --> 00:53:20,554
<font color="yellow">She won't be happy.</font>

732
00:53:34,554 --> 00:53:37,754
<font color="yellow">Thanks to all of you, the company has grown this much.</font>

733
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:40,384
<font color="yellow">We are now exporting more not only to China and Russia,</font>

734
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:42,984
<font color="yellow">but also to all over the world.</font>

735
00:53:43,514 --> 00:53:47,784
<font color="yellow">Let's work on developing our offline sales on top of online marketing.</font>

736
00:53:47,954 --> 00:53:51,154
<font color="yellow">Let's work hard to increase the rate of repurchase.</font>

737
00:53:51,714 --> 00:53:53,954
<font color="yellow">For the ones that posted reviews on our website,</font>

738
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:56,114
<font color="yellow">let's hold events to show our appreciation.</font>

739
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:58,154
<font color="yellow">The profits we have made thanks to your effort...</font>

740
00:53:58,284 --> 00:54:00,454
<font color="yellow">will be used for the product development...</font>

741
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:04,784
<font color="yellow">and for your benefits.</font>

742
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:10,084
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

743
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:13,214
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it.</font>

744
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,654
<font color="yellow">- Good luck. - Thank you.</font>

745
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:17,154
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

746
00:54:24,384 --> 00:54:25,454
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

747
00:54:26,084 --> 00:54:27,984
<font color="yellow">Should I say it here or should we go somewhere else?</font>

748
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:30,014
<font color="yellow">Shall we go somewhere where I can make a big fuss?</font>

749
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:32,154
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, do it quickly. I'm busy.</font>

750
00:54:32,214 --> 00:54:35,514
<font color="yellow">I heard you added the woman's son to your family register.</font>

751
00:54:37,214 --> 00:54:40,314
<font color="yellow">- I warned you. - You have nothing to do with me.</font>

752
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:42,754
<font color="yellow">Stop caring about my family register.</font>

753
00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:44,484
<font color="yellow">The assets I'll give to my kids...</font>

754
00:54:44,554 --> 00:54:46,984
<font color="yellow">are about to be rewarded to some other kid.</font>

755
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,054
<font color="yellow">As you said, you've done everything to save your company.</font>

756
00:54:51,084 --> 00:54:52,184
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to let him take it.</font>

757
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:54,454
<font color="yellow">That has got nothing to do with you.</font>

758
00:54:56,384 --> 00:54:58,284
<font color="yellow">Let me say this clearly.</font>

759
00:54:59,354 --> 00:55:00,384
<font color="yellow">He is...</font>

760
00:55:01,554 --> 00:55:02,654
<font color="yellow">my child.</font>

761
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:05,484
<font color="yellow">I'll treat him the same way I do to Cho Rong and Da Rong.</font>

762
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:06,954
<font color="yellow">He'll get as much asset, too.</font>

<font color="yellow">Sometimes,</font>

767
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:25,714
<font color="yellow">I regretted having divorced you...</font>

768
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:29,484

769

<font color="yellow">Honestly, I had lingering feelings for you, too.</font>

770
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:34,514
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to marry the second time.</font>

776

777
00:55:51,384 --> 00:55:52,984
<font color="yellow">what you have done so far...</font>

778
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:54,554
<font color="yellow">and how much you have hurt your kids.</font>

779
00:55:56,084 --> 00:55:57,354
<font color="yellow">You should reflect deeply on all of that.</font>

804
00:57:47,854 --> 00:57:50,384
<font color="yellow">Since that kid is a boy, you'll hand over the company to him for sure.</font>
