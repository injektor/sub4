<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, do you remember me?</font>

4
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:16,473
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

5
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:19,243
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

6
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,403
<font color="yellow">miss me a lot?</font>

7
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:26,343
<font color="yellow">I will buy you whatever you want.</font>

8
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,173
<font color="yellow">I have this much money.</font>

9
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:30,943
<font color="yellow">I will buy you everything next time.</font>

10
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:33,513
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat.</font>

11
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,473
<font color="yellow">Is Mum doing well?</font>

12
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:43,373
<font color="yellow">She works at a supermarket.</font>

13
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:46,503
<font color="yellow">At a supermarket?</font>

14
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:49,603
<font color="yellow">She works there?</font>

15
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:50,843
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

16
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:54,343
<font color="yellow">Is your stepfather good to you?</font>

17
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:57,143
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I live with Mum at Grandma's place.</font>

18
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:01,743
<font color="yellow">Are you and your mother living at your grandparents' place?</font>

19
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:10,743
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, don't tell anyone that we met today.</font>

20
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:12,503
<font color="yellow">It's our secret.</font>

21
00:01:14,103 --> 00:01:15,103
<font color="yellow">Keep eating.</font>

22
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:36,373
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you?</font>

23
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:39,003
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking all the time as if you've failed?</font>

24
00:01:39,603 --> 00:01:42,303
<font color="yellow">Wake up. Take off your clothes before falling asleep at least.</font>

25
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,043
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone. Just leave me be!</font>

26
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,043
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this on purpose?</font>

27
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,043
<font color="yellow">I did everything you asked me to.</font>

28
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:53,103
<font color="yellow">I've become a public official because you wanted me to.</font>

29
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,643
<font color="yellow">I split up with Gab Soon because you wanted me to.</font>

30
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:59,673
<font color="yellow">All that remains for me is to marry someone you like.</font>

31
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:01,843
<font color="yellow">What else do you want me to do?</font>

32
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:05,673
<font color="yellow">Tell me what to do next. I will do everything you want me to do.</font>

33
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,203
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what you want?</font>

34
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:13,703
<font color="yellow">I want to be alone. Leave.</font>

35
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:34,243
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo, what have you been up to?</font>

36
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,573
<font color="yellow">You haven't called in a while.</font>

37
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,843
<font color="yellow">I hope you are not sick.</font>

38
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,973
<font color="yellow">It's so cold outside.</font>

39
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:47,273
<font color="yellow">You are so late. Were there a lot of customers?</font>

40
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,473
<font color="yellow">It's too early to tell.</font>

41
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:53,803
<font color="yellow">It's all about getting loyal customers in the food business.</font>

42
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:57,043
<font color="yellow">Why are you still up? Did something happen?</font>

43
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:05,603
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

44
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,773
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I'm so sad.</font>

45
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:12,173
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol has been drinking a lot lately.</font>

46
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:14,503
<font color="yellow">He talks back to me. He's never done that.</font>

47
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:15,903
<font color="yellow">What does he say?</font>

48
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,303
<font color="yellow">He says that he did everything I asked him to do.</font>

49
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:20,473
<font color="yellow">- "What else?" he asks. - He said that?</font>

50
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,743
<font color="yellow">Leave him alone. He's sleeping.</font>

51
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:25,803
<font color="yellow">How can he say that to you?</font>

52
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:27,373
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

53
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:31,573
<font color="yellow">He thinks it's okay to drink like that since he split with Gab Soon.</font>

54
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:32,843
<font color="yellow">Crazy jerk.</font>

55
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:34,803
<font color="yellow">He used to cause trouble before...</font>

56
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:38,203
<font color="yellow">only to apologise after a few hours.</font>

57
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:41,303
<font color="yellow">He's changed since he got a job.</font>

58
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,703
<font color="yellow">Maybe he's become arrogant now that he's making money.</font>

59
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,073
<font color="yellow">Money changes people.</font>

60
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:50,043
<font color="yellow">At times like this, she would be the answer.</font>

61
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,473
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

62
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:54,773
<font color="yellow">Remember that girl who works with him?</font>

63
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:59,103
<font color="yellow">If Gab Dol goes out with her, he will forget about Gab Soon.</font>

64
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:05,703
<font color="yellow">Has Gab Dol said anything to you?</font>

65
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:08,773
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about him. I'm no longer interested in men.</font>

66
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:11,003
<font color="yellow">My goodness! Will you live alone for the rest of your life?</font>

67
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,943
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous. I can't live without a man.</font>

68
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,773
<font color="yellow">I'm temporarily not interested.</font>

69
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:18,743
<font color="yellow">If I meet someone in the future,</font>

70
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,273
<font color="yellow">I want my family to like him.</font>

71
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:23,843
<font color="yellow">I've dated with hope before,</font>

72
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:25,873
<font color="yellow">but from now on, I won't date unless I am sure.</font>

73
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,103
<font color="yellow">I am tired of getting hurt.</font>

74
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:29,803
<font color="yellow">My family will like you.</font>

75
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,643
<font color="yellow">I learned my lesson after going through so much.</font>

76
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,043
<font color="yellow">You and I live in a different world.</font>

77
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:37,103
<font color="yellow">And you're just curious and fascinated with me because of that.</font>

78
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:39,603
<font color="yellow">After a while, your feelings will go away.</font>

79
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,203
<font color="yellow">Our family is not like that.</font>

80
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:45,543
<font color="yellow">They told me that they will like whoever I like.</font>

81
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,773
<font color="yellow">This is why I keep telling you to grow up.</font>

82
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,103
<font color="yellow">All parents are alike.</font>

83
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,673
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about this.</font>

84
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:58,073
<font color="yellow">I need to get back on my feet first...</font>

85
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,303
<font color="yellow">before I think about loving someone else.</font>

86
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:02,143
<font color="yellow">Go now.</font>

87
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,913
<font color="yellow">I will be by your side until then.</font>

88
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:08,673
<font color="yellow">I will always be where you need me to be.</font>

89
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,743
<font color="yellow">Is that okay?</font>

90
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,473
<font color="yellow">You have a way with words.</font>

91
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:22,443
<font color="yellow">You must be starving.</font>

92
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,673
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will eat some ramyeon.</font>

93
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,043
<font color="yellow">- I smell bulgogi. - I made it for you.</font>

94
00:05:32,143 --> 00:05:34,543
<font color="yellow">It's past midnight. Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

95
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:36,803
<font color="yellow">How can I sleep when you're not home?</font>

96
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,973
<font color="yellow">Eat. I'm not sure about the taste because I was half asleep.</font>

97
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,543
<font color="yellow">It's delicious. You can cook well even when you're half asleep.</font>

98
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:49,103
<font color="yellow">That's all that matters.</font>

99
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:53,043
<font color="yellow">I will enjoy this food, but tell me what you want to say.</font>

100
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:55,103
<font color="yellow">Please grant me one wish.</font>

101
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,973
<font color="yellow">Can you please stop cleaning?</font>

102
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:00,973
<font color="yellow">I know you're frustrated.</font>

103
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:03,773
<font color="yellow">You tried to become a teacher, but it didn't work out.</font>

104
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,003
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol's been acting arrogant ever since he became a public official.</font>

105
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:08,873
<font color="yellow">On top of that, his mother doesn't even like you.</font>

106
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,873
<font color="yellow">So I know that you were desperate to do anything.</font>

107
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:15,303
<font color="yellow">I know that's why you started your cleaning business.</font>

108
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,273
<font color="yellow">But to be honest, even I don't like what you do.</font>

109
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:24,173
<font color="yellow">If I were Gab Dol's mother, I would act the same way.</font>

110
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:26,903
<font color="yellow">Who would want you as a daughter-in-law?</font>

111
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:28,903
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

112
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:34,173
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, can't you get a job at an office...</font>

113
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:36,543
<font color="yellow">before you get any older?</font>

114
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:39,343
<font color="yellow">You have a college degree.</font>

115
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,603
<font color="yellow">You can get an office job somewhere...</font>

116
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,873
<font color="yellow">even if the salary is not much.</font>

117
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:47,943
<font color="yellow">If you have a job, it's easier to get married.</font>

118
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,543
<font color="yellow">Mum, please grant me one wish, too.</font>

119
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:55,003
<font color="yellow">I may have started with cleaning, but that's not the end.</font>

120
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:58,243
<font color="yellow">I'm interested in interior decorating now.</font>

121
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,503
<font color="yellow">I stay up all night because I have so many ideas.</font>

122
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,103
<font color="yellow">I'm really excited about this.</font>

123
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:06,773
<font color="yellow">I know you're frustrated. Just give me three years.</font>

124
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:10,003
<font color="yellow">I will have an interior decorating firm with 10 employees in 3 years.</font>

125
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:12,743
<font color="yellow">If I fail, I will do whatever you ask.</font>

126
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:15,403
<font color="yellow">Just pretend like I'm not around for three years.</font>

127
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,343
<font color="yellow">I see you everyday. How can I pretend?</font>

128
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:20,573
<font color="yellow">Then should I get my own place?</font>

129
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,843
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

130
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:24,373
<font color="yellow">Go inside. Let her eat.</font>

131
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,373
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

132
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:28,743
<font color="yellow">I can't have a normal conversation with you.</font>

133
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,743
<font color="yellow">I don't like arguing with you everyday either.</font>

134
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,773
<font color="yellow">Can't you just leave me alone?</font>

135
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,343
<font color="yellow">I wish you would just pretend like I don't exist.</font>

136
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:38,503
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that?</font>

137
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,303
<font color="yellow">Just go into your room.</font>

138
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,503
<font color="yellow">Let's just wait and see.</font>

139
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,773
<font color="yellow">Just pretend as if she doesn't exist like she wants you to.</font>

140
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,603
<font color="yellow">- Do you have faith in her? - I do since she's my daughter.</font>

141
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,073
<font color="yellow">She will have 10 employees? How audacious!</font>

142
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:00,703
<font color="yellow">She will go as far as you believe in her. That's what I think.</font>

143
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:03,203
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon belongs to you, doesn't she?</font>

144
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,503
<font color="yellow">There's no use in getting frustrated.</font>

145
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:09,873
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that by now?</font>

146
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:13,173
<font color="yellow">We have no control over our kids.</font>

147
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:17,373
<font color="yellow">From now on, just ignore her whether she come in or goes out.</font>

148
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:24,303
<font color="yellow">I know that you're sad, but do what he says.</font>

149
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,073
<font color="yellow">What else can you do?</font>

150
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:36,443
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for asking you to meet me so suddenly.</font>

151
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:39,513
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I've wanted to talk to you, too.</font>

152
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:42,303
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I should say this.</font>

153
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:44,273
<font color="yellow">I'm not good with words.</font>

154
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,373
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. I will try to understand.</font>

155
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:52,443
<font color="yellow">You said that you liked Gab Dol from the very beginning.</font>

156
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,013
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

157
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,273
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

158
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:58,843
<font color="yellow">However, Gab Dol doesn't know women very well.</font>

159
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:02,573
<font color="yellow">He's always been focused on his school and family.</font>

160
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,803
<font color="yellow">It looks like he has a girlfriend.</font>

161
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,703
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a girlfriend.</font>

162
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:09,103
<font color="yellow">They just went to elementary school together.</font>

163
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:13,343
<font color="yellow">She's the one who's been chasing Gab Dol all along.</font>

164
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,073
<font color="yellow">That's all over now.</font>

165
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,773
<font color="yellow">I don't care about that.</font>

166
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,203
<font color="yellow">It would be weirder if he never went out with anyone at his age.</font>

167
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,443
<font color="yellow">You are so wise.</font>

168
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:28,703
<font color="yellow">Since you work in the same office, could you...</font>

169
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,473
<font color="yellow">I know what you're trying to say.</font>

170
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:35,143
<font color="yellow">You want me to be more proactive about asking him out...</font>

171
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,543
<font color="yellow">and letting him know how I feel, right?</font>

172
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,513
<font color="yellow">That's exactly right.</font>

173
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:43,013
<font color="yellow">I said it poorly, but you understood it perfectly.</font>

174
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:45,873
<font color="yellow">You are so smart.</font>

175
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,013
<font color="yellow">And as I mentioned to you before,</font>

176
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,643
<font color="yellow">I will not meddle with your marriage life, so don't worry about me.</font>

177
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:55,403
<font color="yellow">I already have my retirement plan.</font>

178
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,043
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the first transaction.</font>

179
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:11,443
<font color="yellow">I am thankful.</font>

180
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:19,743
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

181
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:22,203
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

182
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:30,803
<font color="yellow">How awkward.</font>

183
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,273
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get some coffee?</font>

184
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:39,143
<font color="yellow">We don't have much to talk about. Let's just go our separate ways.</font>

185
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:41,603
<font color="yellow">That's fine.</font>

186
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,543
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Goodbye.</font>

187
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:51,013
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

188
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,843
<font color="yellow">I'm very sorry.</font>

189
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:02,373
<font color="yellow">I've been...</font>

190
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,843
<font color="yellow">meaning to tell you this.</font>

191
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:09,003
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

192
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,573
<font color="yellow">Alcohol can mess you up.</font>

193
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:37,273
<font color="yellow">You must be tired.</font>

194
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:39,573
<font color="yellow">I cooked some sweet potatoes. Eat before you wash up.</font>

195
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:41,443
<font color="yellow">Let me just put this away.</font>

196
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,903
<font color="yellow">Don't eat too fast. Drink some water.</font>

197
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:51,073
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Jae Soon.</font>

198
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:55,703
<font color="yellow">I've been eating too much. I'm going to gain weight.</font>

199
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:57,803
<font color="yellow">You should eat a lot since you work a lot.</font>

200
00:11:58,303 --> 00:11:59,543
<font color="yellow">It must be so hard.</font>

201
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:01,643
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're suffering.</font>

202
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:04,343
<font color="yellow">It's something I've decided to do.</font>

203
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:06,343
<font color="yellow">You seem a lot tougher than before.</font>

204
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:09,243
<font color="yellow">I got beat up so much that I got tougher without trying.</font>

205
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:13,473
<font color="yellow">Getting tougher is okay, but it's painful to watch you get hurt.</font>

206
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,903
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon.</font>

207
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:20,373
<font color="yellow">Just ignore what mother says. Just keep doing your best.</font>

208
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,003
<font color="yellow">I heard that you plan to build a company with 10 employees.</font>

209
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,343
<font color="yellow">You can do it.</font>

210
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:29,943
<font color="yellow">I will do it no matter what. I'll show Mum and Dad.</font>

211
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,543
<font color="yellow">Have you heard from Gab Dol since then?</font>

212
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,173
<font color="yellow">We're no longer together.</font>

213
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:38,773
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, I don't have time to meet guys.</font>

214
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:43,143
<font color="yellow">In relationships, you have to receive as much as you give.</font>

215
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:46,973
<font color="yellow">Now, you have to bear with the break up all by yourself.</font>

216
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,343
<font color="yellow">Will you be okay?</font>

217
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:52,143
<font color="yellow">You've known each other for almost 11 years now.</font>

218
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:57,243
<font color="yellow">He's all I've thought about for more than 10 years.</font>

219
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:02,143
<font color="yellow">It will take more than 10 years to forget him.</font>

220
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,403
<font color="yellow">That will be hard.</font>

221
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:08,403
<font color="yellow">Anyway, he's no longer part of my life.</font>

222
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:14,343
<font color="yellow">How would you feel if he got married to someone else?</font>

223
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:16,443
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

224
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:22,303
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you get jealous if he went out with another girl?</font>

225
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:24,203
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

226
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:29,043
<font color="yellow">It's possible that he can fall for someone at his office.</font>

227
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,203
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

228
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:35,573
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wash up now. I have to leave early tomorrow.</font>

229
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,503
<font color="yellow">- This is very delicious. - Thanks.</font>

230
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:07,773
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy your meal. - Yes.</font>

231
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:23,603
<font color="yellow">Why did you come so late? Were you making deliveries until now?</font>

232
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,373
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was busy making deliveries.</font>

233
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:30,473
<font color="yellow">I smell something unfamiliar from you these days.</font>

234
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:32,343
<font color="yellow">Something delicious.</font>

235
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:34,773
<font color="yellow">It's because I deliver alcohols to restaurants.</font>

236
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:40,603
<font color="yellow">Finally, my nose is working properly.</font>

237
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:43,303
<font color="yellow">I smell something from the main building...</font>

238
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:44,843
<font color="yellow">It's chicken.</font>

239
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:47,143
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say it earlier?</font>

240
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:50,343
<font color="yellow">Don't. I'll buy it for you.</font>

241
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:53,843
<font color="yellow">The food you get from others is better than the food you buy.</font>

242
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:55,003
<font color="yellow">Don't call me over.</font>

243
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,903
<font color="yellow">Just come out.</font>

244
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:58,903
<font color="yellow">I said no. I'm not going to eat.</font>

245
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:00,943
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to listen to me?</font>

246
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:02,273
<font color="yellow">Close the door!</font>

247
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:09,573
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you? You never do this.</font>

248
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,303
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd never get to taste your chicken.</font>

249
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:15,603
<font color="yellow">This is the last time. If you want to eat, you'll have to pay for it.</font>

250
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:17,573
<font color="yellow">How does it taste?</font>

251
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:19,703
<font color="yellow">It's good. It's crunchy and flavourful.</font>

252
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:21,473
<font color="yellow">Is he not eating?</font>

253
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,743
<font color="yellow">He doesn't listen to me.</font>

254
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:26,003
<font color="yellow">Let him be. Let's just enjoy this by ourselves.</font>

255
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,803
<font color="yellow">Let's see who's sorry.</font>

256
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:30,903
<font color="yellow">You still get anxious whenever he doesn't come in.</font>

257
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:33,703
<font color="yellow">Don't wait in the cold. Come in.</font>

258
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,573
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I thought I was going to freeze to death.</font>

259
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,603
<font color="yellow">Why are you here by yourself? Where is Soo Jo?</font>

260
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:50,743
<font color="yellow">He told me not to call him. He said he won't eat from here any more.</font>

261
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:52,773
<font color="yellow">He's finally mature.</font>

262
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:54,473
<font color="yellow">He should join us.</font>

263
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,403
<font color="yellow">Why should he join us?</font>

264
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:01,073
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol!</font>

265
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:05,473
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, come out.</font>

266
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,643
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

267
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:12,043
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

268
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:14,603
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

269
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,643
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I threw it out because it's empty.</font>

270
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,073
<font color="yellow">This is empty?</font>

271
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:22,143
<font color="yellow">There's enough to last us a month.</font>

272
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,403
<font color="yellow">I don't know about a month, but there's enough for three more days.</font>

273
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:29,573
<font color="yellow">You're being so frivolous now that you make money.</font>

274
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,243
<font color="yellow">Becoming a millionaire starts by saving a dollar.</font>

275
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,603
<font color="yellow">You should be thrifty with things like this.</font>

276
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:37,643
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's easy to make money? Does money grow on trees?</font>

277
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:38,973
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

278
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:40,903
<font color="yellow">Did someone hit her head?</font>

279
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,373
<font color="yellow">She's not the type to get hit by someone.</font>

280
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:45,843
<font color="yellow">Pay attention and listen to me.</font>

281
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,043
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

282
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:55,803
<font color="yellow">See this?</font>

283
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:59,643
<font color="yellow">I hope you become rich by squeezing that toothpaste tube.</font>

284
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:02,373
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you just wasted my time with this.</font>

285
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:04,003
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

286
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,543
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

287
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:09,673
<font color="yellow">You used to throw away tooth paste all the time before.</font>

288
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,803
<font color="yellow">You used to waste soap, too.</font>

289
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:13,343
<font color="yellow">I will be frugal from now on.</font>

290
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:18,713
<font color="yellow">I saw black bags inside the freezer. What are they?</font>

291
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,503
<font color="yellow">What do you think? They're food.</font>

292
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,243
<font color="yellow">- Do you know what this is? - I have to open the bag to know.</font>

293
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:29,003
<font color="yellow">That's not acceptable.</font>

294
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:31,243
<font color="yellow">You're going to throw them out when they go bad, right?</font>

295
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,643
<font color="yellow">You should label the bag.</font>

296
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,713
<font color="yellow">You have to write what they are.</font>

297
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:40,843
<font color="yellow">If you keep them in black bags, you'll have no idea.</font>

298
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:43,303
<font color="yellow">I learned from using the refrigerator at the store.</font>

299
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:44,743
<font color="yellow">You are wasting money this way.</font>

300
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,543
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

301
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:49,143
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's easy to make money?</font>

302
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,573
<font color="yellow">I can't think enough about money.</font>

303
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:55,873
<font color="yellow">Before, I underestimated the value of 10 or 20 dollars.</font>

304
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,473
<font color="yellow">But now, I don't even take the taxi. I walk instead.</font>

305
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,503
<font color="yellow">I wonder if the taxi drivers are doing well without me.</font>

306
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:11,643
<font color="yellow">My goodness. My daughter has become a female Scrooge.</font>

307
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,713
<font color="yellow">You used to take deluxe taxis only. Now you're walking.</font>

308
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:16,975
<font color="yellow">Even when you dropped a dollar on the floor,</font>

309
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,681
<font color="yellow">you didn't pick it up because you didn't want to bend your back.</font>

310
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:23,273
<font color="yellow">Now, I even pick up a penny.</font>

311
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,303
<font color="yellow">Mum, I opened a bank account.</font>

312
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:32,773
<font color="yellow">This one's for instalment savings, and this one's a deposit passbook.</font>

313
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:38,303
<font color="yellow">This is the very first time I have my own bankbook.</font>

314
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:41,743
<font color="yellow">With the money I make, I'll give you some for your expenses,</font>

315
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:43,303
<font color="yellow">and I'll deposit the rest.</font>

316
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,473
<font color="yellow">I'll make money persistently...</font>

317
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:47,713
<font color="yellow">and bring my kids back again.</font>

318
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:51,343
<font color="yellow">I wonder where they live. They don't even pick up the phone.</font>

319
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,443
<font color="yellow">You don't know where they moved to, do you?</font>

320
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:58,003
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they're doing well.</font>

321
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,003
<font color="yellow">They have their father.</font>

322
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,643
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

323
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,243
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

324
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:24,243
<font color="yellow">Baby!</font>

325
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:53,943
<font color="yellow">Baby, later on,</font>

326
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:56,503
<font color="yellow">I will come find you no matter what.</font>

327
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,443
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

328
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:02,343
<font color="yellow">Until then, please stay alive.</font>

329
00:21:35,443 --> 00:21:38,303
<font color="yellow">My blood pressure has been seriously problematic for the past few days.</font>

330
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,443
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can tell you.</font>

331
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:45,143
<font color="yellow">Si Nae, I'm sorry.</font>

332
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:46,803
<font color="yellow">It's my fault.</font>

333
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,203
<font color="yellow">I'll beg for your forgiveness for the rest of my life.</font>

334
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:57,443
<font color="yellow">That's that, and we must look for your son first.</font>

335
00:21:57,973 --> 00:22:01,243
<font color="yellow">I already did, but they said there's no way I can find him any more.</font>

336
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:04,803
<font color="yellow">I don't even know if he's alive.</font>

337
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:08,803
<font color="yellow">I totally forgot about him all this time.</font>

338
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,403
<font color="yellow">For some time, I tried to forget about him.</font>

339
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,603
<font color="yellow">After that, I really forgot about him...</font>

340
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:19,043
<font color="yellow">as if I never even gave birth to him.</font>

341
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:21,803
<font color="yellow">I acted as if he doesn't exist in this world.</font>

342
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:25,203
<font color="yellow">I'm so brazen and bad.</font>

343
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:32,443
<font color="yellow">You were only 18. You were young.</font>

344
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:35,303
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself too much. I'm the bad guy.</font>

345
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:38,743
<font color="yellow">Thinking that Se Gye might take over the company,</font>

346
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:42,173
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd be better to give the company to my own blood line.</font>

347
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:43,903
<font color="yellow">That's why I began to look for him.</font>

348
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,573
<font color="yellow">It's been so long, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to find him.</font>

349
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,173
<font color="yellow">Let's look for him together.</font>

350
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:54,043
<font color="yellow">We'll be able to find him as long as he's alive.</font>

351
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,973
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be hard to find a man these days.</font>

352
00:22:58,273 --> 00:23:00,673
<font color="yellow">Be specific. How much will you pay back each time?</font>

353
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:03,343
<font color="yellow">- How much per month? - 100 dollars.</font>

354
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:06,273
<font color="yellow">- 100 dollars only? - 100 dollars per month.</font>

355
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,203
<font color="yellow">There are 12 months in a year,</font>

356
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:12,303
<font color="yellow">so let's multiply 100 by 12. That comes to...</font>

357
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:16,343
<font color="yellow">1,200 dollars. Multiply that by 10 years, and that's 12,000 dollars.</font>

358
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:19,003
<font color="yellow">When will you ever pay back all the 100,000 dollars?</font>

359
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:21,343
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll give you 200 dollars.</font>

360
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:25,673
<font color="yellow">Multiply 200 by 12. That's 2,400 dollars.</font>

361
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,173
<font color="yellow">(Are you the famous Jo A Young?)</font>

362
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,143
<font color="yellow">I'm so frustrated.</font>

363
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:33,873
<font color="yellow">Please do something about them.</font>

364
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:35,973
<font color="yellow">They're driving me insane.</font>

365
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:40,703
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - What are you talking about?</font>

366
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:42,273
<font color="yellow">We've already deleted them.</font>

367
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:46,003
<font color="yellow">She can't even go to work because of the malicious comments.</font>

368
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:49,343
<font color="yellow">People captured the screen and posted it online. What do you want?</font>

369
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:51,203
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't have done that to begin with.</font>

370
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:52,903
<font color="yellow">Liar.</font>

371
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,243
<font color="yellow">Please tell your friends to delete them.</font>

372
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:56,573
<font color="yellow">I beg you.</font>

373
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,673
<font color="yellow">What a poor guy. All right.</font>

374
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:02,043
<font color="yellow">Don't live like that.</font>

375
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:03,843
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

376
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:12,103
<font color="yellow">See? Even middle school kids neglect me.</font>

377
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:13,643
<font color="yellow">Let's solve one thing at at time.</font>

378
00:24:20,103 --> 00:24:21,573
<font color="yellow">What are you doing at this hour?</font>

379
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:23,643
<font color="yellow">Nothing. Go back to sleep.</font>

380
00:24:28,503 --> 00:24:30,973
<font color="yellow">Hey, alcohol buddy. Do you want to grab a drink?</font>

381
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,703
<font color="yellow">My mum's still awake.</font>

382
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,243
<font color="yellow">Mum, are you sleeping?</font>

383
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:47,703
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

384
00:24:48,343 --> 00:24:51,773
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some water? - No. I'm going to sleep.</font>

385
00:24:58,303 --> 00:25:00,143
<font color="yellow">I live with Mum at grandma's place.</font>

386
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:02,343
<font color="yellow">Mum works at a supermarket.</font>

387
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:07,003
<font color="yellow">Is she taking good care of Ddol Ee?</font>

388
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:10,843
<font color="yellow">She is. You have nothing to worry about.</font>

389
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:24,643
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

390
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:45,103
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

391
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:48,903
<font color="yellow">It's freezing.</font>

392
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:11,873
<font color="yellow">She really had a hard time falling asleep tonight.</font>

393
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:15,043
<font color="yellow">I asked her so many times if she was sleeping or not.</font>

394
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,003
<font color="yellow">She got mad and said, "Why do you keep calling me?"</font>

395
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,373
<font color="yellow">She finally fell asleep, but on my way out,</font>

396
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:24,103
<font color="yellow">I was afraid that she might suddenly grab me from the back.</font>

397
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:26,503
<font color="yellow">I was so nervous.</font>

398
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:31,973
<font color="yellow">I need to hurry up and get back on my feet soon.</font>

399
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:34,343
<font color="yellow">That way, I'll be able to date you openly.</font>

400
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:38,673
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for not doing anything nice to your parents.</font>

401
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:41,303
<font color="yellow">They would've hated to have a son-in-law like me.</font>

402
00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:44,843
<font color="yellow">You finally figured that out? I hated you so much back then.</font>

403
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:47,343
<font color="yellow">You couldn't do much because that's your personality.</font>

404
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:49,943
<font color="yellow">You know what my personality is like? You said you didn't.</font>

405
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:53,173
<font color="yellow">At first, you're cold and unfriendly.</font>

406
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:54,643
<font color="yellow">You're not very likeable.</font>

407
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:58,403
<font color="yellow">But with time, I realised how genuine you are.</font>

408
00:26:58,803 --> 00:26:59,873
<font color="yellow">That's correct.</font>

409
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:02,743
<font color="yellow">You're so full of yourself.</font>

410
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:04,443
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't compliment you.</font>

411
00:27:05,743 --> 00:27:07,743
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

412
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:13,273
<font color="yellow">You're a total prude and vixen.</font>

413
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:14,903
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

414
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:17,603
<font color="yellow">I'm kidding.</font>

415
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,173
<font color="yellow">Go home first.</font>

416
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,973
<font color="yellow">Please wait a little bit.</font>

417
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:32,173
<font color="yellow">I'm saving money at the moment.</font>

418
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:33,943
<font color="yellow">I'm going to...</font>

419
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:37,303
<font color="yellow">take back my kids, so until then,</font>

420
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:41,043
<font color="yellow">take good care of them.</font>

421
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,373
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

422
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:14,303
<font color="yellow">Be honest with me.</font>

423
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:17,273
<font color="yellow">Where have you been at this hour?</font>

424
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:19,603
<font color="yellow">You even tried to disguise me with a pillow.</font>

425
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:22,843
<font color="yellow">- I met a friend. - Which one?</font>

426
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:24,643
<font color="yellow">You don't know all of my friends.</font>

427
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:26,803
<font color="yellow">You can meet them during the day.</font>

428
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:30,043
<font color="yellow">Why leave in the middle of the night? You're fishy.</font>

429
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,443
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to suspect.</font>

430
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,343
<font color="yellow">I listened to my friend venting about her quarrel with her husband.</font>

431
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:35,903
<font color="yellow">I'm an expert when it comes to divorce.</font>

432
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:37,273
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

433
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:39,703
<font color="yellow">What did you say as an expert?</font>

434
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:42,243
<font color="yellow">"Try your best not to get a divorce."</font>

435
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,443
<font color="yellow">Did you drink alcohol?</font>

436
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:48,203
<font color="yellow">I had beer. Go back to sleep.</font>

437
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,343
<font color="yellow">You didn't go see Geum Sik, did you?</font>

438
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:54,003
<font color="yellow">Why would I go see him in the middle of the night...</font>

439
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,543
<font color="yellow">even if I liked him so much?</font>

440
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,043
<font color="yellow">I'm not happy with any of my daughters.</font>

441
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:11,403
<font color="yellow">You're still awake.</font>

442
00:30:11,403 --> 00:30:13,943
<font color="yellow">Why in the world are you running about at this hour?</font>

443
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:16,173
<font color="yellow">Aunt Nae Shim.</font>

444
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:19,103
<font color="yellow">- What? - Give me some rice.</font>

445
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:21,173
<font color="yellow">I don't like him, either.</font>

446
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:30,703
<font color="yellow">Even my sister-in-law's son treats me like a maid.</font>

447
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:33,043
<font color="yellow">What a great fate I have.</font>

448
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,443
<font color="yellow">Once the soup is heated, serve yourself.</font>

449
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,173
<font color="yellow">Clean up once you're finished, and don't make a mess.</font>

450
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:48,443
<font color="yellow">Let me serve it for you.</font>

451
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:50,803
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you. Go back in.</font>

452
00:30:51,873 --> 00:30:54,973
<font color="yellow">When you're finished, leave the dishes. I'll clean them up.</font>

453
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:25,243
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep and do it tomorrow. You'll faint.</font>

454
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:28,173
<font color="yellow">- I'll just finish this. - Are there customers until late?</font>

455
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:29,903
<font color="yellow">I should serve at least one more customer.</font>

456
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:32,273
<font color="yellow">Don't accept the ones who come too late.</font>

457
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:34,273
<font color="yellow">You should look after yourself, too.</font>

458
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,073
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

459
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:39,443
<font color="yellow">Who knows if they'll bring their friends next time?</font>

460
00:31:40,803 --> 00:31:42,043
<font color="yellow">You're a mother after all.</font>

461
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,903
<font color="yellow">That's how a parent feels.</font>

462
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,173
<font color="yellow">Look at you, working persistently to take your kids back.</font>

463
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,473
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

464
00:31:50,303 --> 00:31:53,203
<font color="yellow">I've blamed others all my life.</font>

465
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:57,503
<font color="yellow">Even if I did something wrong, I blamed others.</font>

466
00:31:58,773 --> 00:32:00,773
<font color="yellow">"This is how I am. What do you want me to do?"</font>

467
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,343
<font color="yellow">I always had lame excuses.</font>

468
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:08,873
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong and Da Rong must have been through a lot.</font>

469
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:11,073
<font color="yellow">Thinking back now,</font>

470
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,303
<font color="yellow">my husband must have put up with me a lot.</font>

471
00:32:15,003 --> 00:32:17,273
<font color="yellow">I wonder how he managed to live with a person like me.</font>

472
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,403
<font color="yellow">When I think back on the past,</font>

473
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,343
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of regrets.</font>

474
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,343
<font color="yellow">Regretting won't make any difference now.</font>

475
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:28,873
<font color="yellow">It'll only break your heart. Forget it.</font>

476
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:39,043
<font color="yellow">I liked your report. It's much more clear now.</font>

477
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:40,973
<font color="yellow">Continue working like this.</font>

478
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:44,573
<font color="yellow">- Revise the ones I've ticked off. - All right.</font>

479
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:49,343
<font color="yellow">Congratulations. It's your first monthly pay cheque today.</font>

480
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:51,873
<font color="yellow">- I know. - It's great, isn't it?</font>

481
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,543
<font color="yellow">Let's go buy your mother a gift.</font>

482
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:57,403
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

483
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:02,973
<font color="yellow">Please give me a pair of female long Johns.</font>

484
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:05,373
<font color="yellow">You don't know her size, do you?</font>

485
00:33:06,143 --> 00:33:08,773
<font color="yellow">You must have received your first monthly pay cheque.</font>

486
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:11,203
<font color="yellow">- What is her size? - It's...</font>

487
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:14,443
<font color="yellow">She's 162cm tall and 50kg.</font>

488
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:17,773
<font color="yellow">She's a bit slim with an average figure. Am I right?</font>

489
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:19,373
<font color="yellow">Kind of.</font>

490
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:21,743
<font color="yellow">Then this will do.</font>

491
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:24,773
<font color="yellow">You should get one more for your sister.</font>

492
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:30,373
<font color="yellow">See? You got nice gifts because of me.</font>

493
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:34,803
<font color="yellow">You couldn't go in alone and ask for female long Johns, could you?</font>

494
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:36,643
<font color="yellow">You owe me a favour.</font>

495
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:40,843
<font color="yellow">You know you should return the favour, right?</font>

496
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:42,373
<font color="yellow">How should I return it?</font>

497
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,303
<font color="yellow">Buy me a beer this weekend.</font>

498
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:49,303
<font color="yellow">I'm excited. The most delicious beer is the one a male junior buys.</font>

499
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:52,643
<font color="yellow">I hope your mother will like it.</font>

500
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:55,343
<font color="yellow">She will.</font>

501
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:09,573
<font color="yellow">My gosh, I'm wearing long Johns that my son got me.</font>

502
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:11,503
<font color="yellow">It's my first time in my life.</font>

503
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:16,203
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Gosh, how old-fashioned.</font>

504
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:19,303
<font color="yellow">- What's up with the red long Johns? - What do you mean, "old-fashioned"?</font>

505
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:21,573
<font color="yellow">I've wanted to wear these long Johns so much.</font>

506
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:24,803
<font color="yellow">Every time my friends bragged about their children getting them...</font>

507
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:28,613
<font color="yellow">red long Johns with their first pay cheque, I was so jealous.</font>

508
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:31,143
<font color="yellow">I wanted to get one for myself discreetly.</font>

509
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:34,373
<font color="yellow">I better go out and brag tomorrow.</font>

510
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,373
<font color="yellow">I'll get you another one, so wear it often.</font>

511
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:38,803
<font color="yellow">- Is there nothing for me? - Of course, there is.</font>

512
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:44,143
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

513
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,203
<font color="yellow">I still care about fashion. You're treating me like an old lady.</font>

514
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:49,003
<font color="yellow">You should wear this.</font>

515
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:53,303
<font color="yellow">It's cold, so wear this. Wearing red underwear will bring you money.</font>

516
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:54,903
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

517
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:58,303
<font color="yellow">If wearing this will bring me money, I'll wear 10 of them.</font>

518
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:00,643
<font color="yellow">Can I wear yours, too?</font>

519
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:02,273
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

520
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:05,003
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Gab Dol.</font>

521
00:35:05,613 --> 00:35:08,403
<font color="yellow">- What will you get for me? - I'm not spending a penny.</font>

522
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:13,243
<font color="yellow">Even if it's freezing outside, I won't buy clothes.</font>

523
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:16,073
<font color="yellow">You said you'd pay for expenses. You make money, so pay a lot.</font>

524
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:18,043
<font color="yellow">I'll give you enough money.</font>

525
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:21,703
<font color="yellow">You're better off than I am, so I'll take advantage of it.</font>

526
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,043
<font color="yellow">What a Scrooge.</font>

527
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:25,043
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol.</font>

528
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,843
<font color="yellow">Since you received your pay cheque, spend some money at my store.</font>

529
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,203
<font color="yellow">- What a Scrooge. - Come on!</font>

530
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:33,573
<font color="yellow">Both of your names should change...</font>

531
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,343
<font color="yellow">to Ms Scrooge and Mr Scrooge.</font>

532
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:43,173
<font color="yellow">A parcel came for you earlier.</font>

533
00:35:45,703 --> 00:35:48,943
<font color="yellow">What is it? I was going to open it, then I decided not to.</font>

534
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,373
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so pretty.</font>

535
00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:04,743
<font color="yellow">This must be really expensive. Who sent it?</font>

536
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:08,343
<font color="yellow">- It's from Gab Dol, isn't it? - Please leave.</font>

537
00:36:08,443 --> 00:36:11,873
<font color="yellow">Is it the last gift from him? If you won't wear it, give it to me.</font>

538
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,643
<font color="yellow">- Get out. - Gab Soon!</font>

539
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,443
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

540
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:18,073
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

541
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:30,003
<font color="yellow">I promised I'd get you a ring with my first pay cheque,</font>

542
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:31,943
<font color="yellow">but things turned out like this.</font>

543
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:33,943
<font color="yellow">I picked out a necklace for you.</font>

544
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:36,943
<font color="yellow">It's not a cheap one. I got it at the department store,</font>

545
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:38,743
<font color="yellow">so don't throw it away on the street.</font>

546
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:42,273
<font color="yellow">Take care and don't get sick.</font>

547
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:44,343
<font color="yellow">Eat well.</font>

548
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:13,373
<font color="yellow">(Mr Yeo)</font>

549
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:17,843
<font color="yellow">- It's me. - Come on outside.</font>

550
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:35,113
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong with my age</font>

551
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,743
<font color="yellow">Age doesn't matter when it comes to love</font>

552
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:43,343
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

553
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:44,973
<font color="yellow">You trust me, right?</font>

554
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:48,803
<font color="yellow">If you do, stay calm for a while. Don't contact me.</font>

555
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,343
<font color="yellow">Is it because your daughter is not approving of me?</font>

556
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:55,573
<font color="yellow">I was worried about that.</font>

557
00:37:56,613 --> 00:37:59,173
<font color="yellow">It's not like I was on good terms with your daughter.</font>

558
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:02,873
<font color="yellow">I would have felt the same way.</font>

559
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:07,843
<font color="yellow">I would also think that some woman is after my father's money.</font>

560
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:09,373
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

561
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:11,173
<font color="yellow">Mr Yeo.</font>

562
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:14,873
<font color="yellow">Let's not walk the difficult path.</font>

563
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:16,243
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you want to break up?</font>

564
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:22,113
<font color="yellow">You said you trust me. Then trust me.</font>

565
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:24,803
<font color="yellow">I promised to take care of you.</font>

566
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:27,113
<font color="yellow">There's no need.</font>

567
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:29,643
<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself.</font>

568
00:38:30,903 --> 00:38:33,373
<font color="yellow">If I can't, then I'll just die.</font>

569
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,473
<font color="yellow">I have no regrets.</font>

570
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:38,203
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? You're too young.</font>

571
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:39,843
<font color="yellow">Don't think otherwise.</font>

572
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,003
<font color="yellow">It's because I can't give a definite answer at the moment.</font>

573
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:46,743
<font color="yellow">It's only because you can't say you want to break up with me.</font>

574
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,143
<font color="yellow">I have that much sense.</font>

575
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,943
<font color="yellow">I'm only a housekeeper, and I didn't learn much.</font>

576
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:53,936
<font color="yellow">But I do have enough sense to know how you feel.</font>

577
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:55,673
<font color="yellow">While you get paid by me, listen to me.</font>

578
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,613
<font color="yellow">I won't any more.</font>

579
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,543
<font color="yellow">Don't talk any more. I'll be going.</font>

580
00:39:10,543 --> 00:39:12,113
<font color="yellow">Is it true or not?</font>

581
00:39:12,303 --> 00:39:14,043
<font color="yellow">Is it reality or a dream?</font>

582
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,473
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

583
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:22,803
<font color="yellow">How about some drinks?</font>

584
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:24,673
<font color="yellow">Drink up.</font>

585
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:39,973
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

586
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:43,573
<font color="yellow">Did someone run away with your money?</font>

587
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:49,273
<font color="yellow">Is Gab Dol living with that girl again?</font>

588
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:02,543
<font color="yellow">You don't usually drink alone.</font>

589
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,113
<font color="yellow">But at a time like this,</font>

590
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,873
<font color="yellow">I cant help but drink.</font>

591
00:40:09,403 --> 00:40:10,973
<font color="yellow">How am I as a woman?</font>

592
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:17,673
<font color="yellow">That never crossed my mind.</font>

593
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:20,613
<font color="yellow">I swear that I never have.</font>

594
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:22,803
<font color="yellow">When you give me food,</font>

595
00:40:23,113 --> 00:40:26,243
<font color="yellow">I imagined twice that if I live with you,</font>

596
00:40:26,643 --> 00:40:28,403
<font color="yellow">I won't ever be hungry.</font>

597
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:31,703
<font color="yellow">I mean, three times. However, I haven't thought more about it.</font>

598
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,543
<font color="yellow">I'm being honest.</font>

599
00:40:36,243 --> 00:40:38,803
<font color="yellow">You're not my type of woman.</font>

600
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:41,143
<font color="yellow">So you're saying I'm not that attractive.</font>

601
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,643
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything about that.</font>

602
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:45,703
<font color="yellow">Just don't think of me the wrong way.</font>

603
00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:50,113
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean anything when I brought rice cake for you last time.</font>

604
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:52,273
<font color="yellow">I actually brought it for Soo Jo.</font>

605
00:40:52,443 --> 00:40:55,143
<font color="yellow">But he didn't want to eat it, so I gave it to you.</font>

606
00:40:55,613 --> 00:40:57,843
<font color="yellow">Don't think of me that way.</font>

607
00:40:59,243 --> 00:41:00,373
<font color="yellow">That's scary.</font>

608
00:41:01,143 --> 00:41:02,143
<font color="yellow">Can...</font>

609
00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:03,873
<font color="yellow">I leave?</font>

610
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:06,613
<font color="yellow">Could you sing one song for me?</font>

611
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:09,703
<font color="yellow">A song?</font>

612
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:11,573
<font color="yellow">What song?</font>

613
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,143
<font color="yellow">Will that be all?</font>

614
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:15,443
<font color="yellow">Sing a song for me and eat the mandarin.</font>

615
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,443
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

616
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:25,703
<font color="yellow">What about my age</font>

617
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:27,243
<font color="yellow">Not that song.</font>

618
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:32,803
<font color="yellow">The song with the lyrics that says, "I don't know why I'm like this".</font>

619
00:41:33,643 --> 00:41:34,943
<font color="yellow">Sit down and sing it.</font>

620
00:41:35,503 --> 00:41:38,573
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I'm like this</font>

621
00:41:39,973 --> 00:41:42,903
<font color="yellow">I have no idea</font>

622
00:41:44,113 --> 00:41:47,143
<font color="yellow">I can put a finger on it</font>

623
00:41:48,143 --> 00:41:51,243
<font color="yellow">I have a sorrowful heart</font>

624
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,803
<font color="yellow">I know I shouldn't</font>

625
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:59,973
<font color="yellow">I know we're strangers</font>

626
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:04,113
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I'm like this</font>

627
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:07,673
<font color="yellow">I have tears in my eyes</font>

628
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,043
<font color="yellow">- What are you cooking? - Kimchi pancakes.</font>

629
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:34,743
<font color="yellow">Don't stare and go back in.</font>

630
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:37,643
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to make.</font>

631
00:42:37,743 --> 00:42:41,043
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone. I'm making it for myself, not for you.</font>

632
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:53,113
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

633
00:42:53,873 --> 00:42:56,143
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't use perilla oil.</font>

634
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,273
<font color="yellow">It's nice and savoury.</font>

635
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:00,273
<font color="yellow">Who doesn't know that?</font>

636
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,303
<font color="yellow">It's expensive.</font>

637
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,613
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows that it's tasty.</font>

638
00:43:05,643 --> 00:43:06,803
<font color="yellow">This is for frying pancakes.</font>

639
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:11,003
<font color="yellow">You have these.</font>

640
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:13,573
<font color="yellow">Soy bean oil and corn oil.</font>

641
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,403
<font color="yellow">Don't you waste perilla oil.</font>

642
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:19,143
<font color="yellow">I was able to get just two bottles of perilla oil last autumn and...</font>

643
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:22,613
<font color="yellow">couldn't even use a drop of it because it's so precious.</font>

644
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:24,843
<font color="yellow">You usually can't find things.</font>

645
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:27,743
<font color="yellow">How did you know where the perilla oil was?</font>

646
00:43:27,843 --> 00:43:29,673
<font color="yellow">Which do you love better? Perilla oil or a person?</font>

647
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,303
<font color="yellow">Perilla oil.</font>

648
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:35,773
<font color="yellow">It's not tasty if it's thick.</font>

649
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:40,373
<font color="yellow">Don't expect much from me.</font>

650
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:42,473
<font color="yellow">It's better to be good.</font>

651
00:43:42,673 --> 00:43:44,343
<font color="yellow">Leave it. This is who I am.</font>

652
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,503
<font color="yellow">A person is precious for being that person in itself.</font>

653
00:43:49,673 --> 00:43:52,343
<font color="yellow">It's not because he's talented, rich...</font>

654
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:54,673
<font color="yellow">or good at something.</font>

655
00:43:55,943 --> 00:43:57,473
<font color="yellow">That's what I think nowadays.</font>

656
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,673
<font color="yellow">Who cares who I am?</font>

657
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:02,843
<font color="yellow">Who cares what my job is and how much my yearly salary is?</font>

658
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:05,703
<font color="yellow">I'm precious just by the fact that I am alive.</font>

659
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:08,303
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

660
00:44:08,903 --> 00:44:11,503
<font color="yellow">Don't lose your focus and just cook those pancakes.</font>

661
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:13,903
<font color="yellow">Leave it. I'm the only person who's going to eat it anyway.</font>

662
00:44:14,306 --> 00:44:16,306
<font color="yellow">Who cares if it's not pretty or neat?</font>

663
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:19,343
<font color="yellow">Even if it's ugly, it's all right if it's tasty.</font>

664
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:23,503
<font color="yellow">Don't expect much from our kids, either.</font>

665
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:27,373
<font color="yellow">Just be thankful that they never got in an accident and got hurt.</font>

666
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:30,543
<font color="yellow">It's a blessing that they're alive and well beside us.</font>

667
00:44:31,073 --> 00:44:34,003
<font color="yellow">They did their part when they were little.</font>

668
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:35,743
<font color="yellow">What did they do for us?</font>

669
00:44:35,903 --> 00:44:38,103
<font color="yellow">We did all the work raising them.</font>

670
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:39,273
<font color="yellow">Did you forget?</font>

671
00:44:40,203 --> 00:44:41,273
<font color="yellow">We...</font>

672
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:43,873
<font color="yellow">were happy thanks to them.</font>

673
00:44:44,273 --> 00:44:45,973
<font color="yellow">We laughed when they took their first step.</font>

674
00:44:46,273 --> 00:44:49,403
<font color="yellow">They made us happy when they first started talking and went to school.</font>

675
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:52,973
<font color="yellow">Thanks to them, we lived without knowing the difficulties in life.</font>

676
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,403
<font color="yellow">They did their part by doing that.</font>

677
00:44:55,703 --> 00:44:57,573
<font color="yellow">I never wanted them to do anything for me.</font>

678
00:44:57,973 --> 00:44:59,873
<font color="yellow">I just want them to be the best for themselves.</font>

679
00:45:00,503 --> 00:45:04,303
<font color="yellow">You're right. I didn't want anything from them when I gave birth to them.</font>

680
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:06,903
<font color="yellow">I just wished that they'd be healthy and well.</font>

681
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:09,573
<font color="yellow">Then you wanted them to get good grades,</font>

682
00:45:09,943 --> 00:45:12,673
<font color="yellow">a good job and earn lots of money.</font>

683
00:45:13,103 --> 00:45:14,443
<font color="yellow">Don't be greedy.</font>

684
00:45:14,643 --> 00:45:17,773
<font color="yellow">That's not the problem. Your pancakes are getting burnt.</font>

685
00:45:18,303 --> 00:45:19,773
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

686
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:21,573
<font color="yellow">It is getting burnt.</font>

687
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,843
<font color="yellow">I can't bear to watch this.</font>

688
00:45:30,643 --> 00:45:31,703
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

689
00:45:31,973 --> 00:45:34,473
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't call. I was worried that something might've happened.</font>

690
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:35,973
<font color="yellow">I was worried you were sick.</font>

691
00:45:36,273 --> 00:45:39,643
<font color="yellow">I'm not sick. Something came up recently.</font>

692
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,043
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet?</font>

693
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:42,903
<font color="yellow">I have some money.</font>

694
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:52,273
<font color="yellow">Why? Is it not tasty?</font>

695
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:56,803
<font color="yellow">It is tasty. I'm just not hungry.</font>

696
00:45:57,873 --> 00:46:00,373
<font color="yellow">You must be happy that you have a son.</font>

697
00:46:02,003 --> 00:46:03,873
<font color="yellow">He says that he'll drop by to say hello.</font>

698
00:46:04,073 --> 00:46:06,203
<font color="yellow">He says that he's nearby.</font>

699
00:46:07,073 --> 00:46:10,143
<font color="yellow">I can't wait to meet him.</font>

700
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:15,243
<font color="yellow">Did you fire your housekeeper?</font>

701
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:18,073
<font color="yellow">She's at home all day these days.</font>

702
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:20,573
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. I don't like her.</font>

703
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:22,843
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

704
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:27,043
<font color="yellow">- That's why. - Do Geum. Can't you move?</font>

705
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:28,743
<font color="yellow">The place is cheap and nice.</font>

706
00:46:28,843 --> 00:46:31,873
<font color="yellow">I'll get you a house. I wish you'd move.</font>

707
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:36,543
<font color="yellow">Si Nae. Why do you care for a person like me?</font>

708
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:39,403
<font color="yellow">I was a bad person who tried to pull a scam on you.</font>

709
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:41,303
<font color="yellow">You aren't a bad person.</font>

710
00:46:41,903 --> 00:46:45,643
<font color="yellow">There are people who try to exploit one's wealth using their family.</font>

711
00:46:46,043 --> 00:46:48,043
<font color="yellow">But you didn't get to do anything.</font>

712
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,943
<font color="yellow">It's obvious seeing that you still live in room for rent.</font>

713
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:58,373
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - You're here.</font>

714
00:46:59,173 --> 00:47:00,243
<font color="yellow">He's my son.</font>

715
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:02,973
<font color="yellow">Say hello. This is my girlfriend.</font>

716
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:07,443
<font color="yellow">I'll be going.</font>

717
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:10,003
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

718
00:47:10,743 --> 00:47:11,803
<font color="yellow">Leave him.</font>

719
00:47:12,403 --> 00:47:14,103
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? Excuse me.</font>

720
00:47:21,043 --> 00:47:22,803
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo. What's wrong?</font>

721
00:47:24,103 --> 00:47:25,703
<font color="yellow">Don't you like my girlfriend?</font>

722
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,803
<font color="yellow">- Don't meet that woman. - Why not?</font>

723
00:47:29,703 --> 00:47:30,873
<font color="yellow">There's something about her.</font>

724
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:34,973
<font color="yellow">- Do you know her? - I don't want to talk about it.</font>

725
00:47:35,303 --> 00:47:38,003
<font color="yellow">Don't ask any more questions. Just stop seeing her.</font>

726
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:39,803
<font color="yellow">She lives in a totally different world from us.</font>

727
00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:42,103
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. I need to get back to work.</font>

728
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:48,743
<font color="yellow">What's his reason?</font>

729
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:52,073
<font color="yellow">He won't say. He just told me not to see her.</font>

730
00:47:52,343 --> 00:47:53,543
<font color="yellow">I wonder why.</font>

731
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:57,703
<font color="yellow">Will you stop seeing her just because he doesn't want you to?</font>

732
00:47:57,973 --> 00:47:58,973
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

733
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:01,843
<font color="yellow">That's just your son talking. She's still your girlfriend.</font>

734
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:04,173
<font color="yellow">That's not how I live my life.</font>

735
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:07,003
<font color="yellow">If my son doesn't agree, I won't see her.</font>

736
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:10,043
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

737
00:48:11,203 --> 00:48:12,373
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

738
00:48:20,173 --> 00:48:22,173
<font color="yellow">- Look. - What is it?</font>

739
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:29,443
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol must have given it to her.</font>

740
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:32,173
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon didn't sleep all night because she was crying.</font>

741
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:36,573
<font color="yellow">Can I keep this necklace?</font>

742
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,603
<font color="yellow">It's such a waste. It looks expensive.</font>

743
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:45,943
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Don't be funny. You know what she's going through.</font>

744
00:49:02,843 --> 00:49:03,873
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

745
00:49:04,103 --> 00:49:06,903
<font color="yellow">Isn't that your friend?</font>

746
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,603
<font color="yellow">Let's go. This is uncomfortable.</font>

747
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:20,103
<font color="yellow">She must be on a date. They look great together.</font>

748
00:49:20,603 --> 00:49:23,273
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? They looked awkward.</font>

749
00:49:24,043 --> 00:49:25,603
<font color="yellow">She went on a blind date not long ago.</font>

754
00:49:37,503 --> 00:49:39,573
<font color="yellow">How about we go see my parents?</font>

755
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:44,203

760
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:55,421

764
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:02,703
<font color="yellow">He wants sujebi.</font>

765
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:04,867
<font color="yellow">Not you. I was asking Se Gye.</font>

766

769

770

772
00:50:22,673 --> 00:50:26,543

779
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:49,373
<font color="yellow">It wasn't because I didn't like her. I was just teaching her a lesson.</font>

780

787

791
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:28,943
<font color="yellow">It's difficult to keep the balance.</font>

792
00:51:29,243 --> 00:51:32,903
<font color="yellow">You should listen to Mr Yeo first. He's the eldest.</font>

793
00:51:33,643 --> 00:51:36,473
<font color="yellow">It must be difficult to work with your mother-in-law.</font>

810
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:45,443

811
00:52:46,073 --> 00:52:48,773

900
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:21,703
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows that except you.</font>

901
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:24,473
<font color="yellow">If she didn't love you, she would have left you a long time ago.</font>

902
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:26,803
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one who didn't know.</font>

903
00:58:27,543 --> 00:58:29,973
<font color="yellow">If you don't like her, can I take a shot at Gab Soon?</font>

904
00:58:30,803 --> 00:58:32,903
<font color="yellow">I liked Gab Soon ever since elementary school.</font>

905
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,073
<font color="yellow">Who hasn't liked Gab Soon among our friends?</font>

906
00:58:36,503 --> 00:58:38,003
<font color="yellow">Everyone held back because of you.</font>

907
00:58:38,243 --> 00:58:41,073
<font color="yellow">Even your names show that you belong together.</font>

908
00:58:41,373 --> 00:58:43,673
<font color="yellow">Dal Tong and Gab Soon don't go together very well.</font>

909
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:45,903
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol and Gab Soon sound perfect.</font>

910
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:49,003
<font color="yellow">Even though we've dated for 10 years,</font>

911
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:52,103
<font color="yellow">I still feel like I don't know her.</font>

912
00:58:53,303 --> 00:58:55,073
<font color="yellow">Even you and Se Kyung know her better.</font>

913
00:58:57,503 --> 00:58:59,173
<font color="yellow">From now on, I won't believe her.</font>

914
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:01,543
<font color="yellow">You will believe the other girl, but not Gab Soon?</font>

915
00:59:03,003 --> 00:59:04,973
<font color="yellow">Poor Gab Soon.</font>

916
00:59:06,103 --> 00:59:08,073
<font color="yellow">I will do whatever I want from now on.</font>

917
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:11,903
<font color="yellow">I will make decisions from now on.</font>

918
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,273
<font color="yellow">(Realtor Office)</font>

919
00:59:17,873 --> 00:59:20,573
<font color="yellow">There is a clean office space.</font>

920
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:22,643
<font color="yellow">It's not very expensive.</font>

921
00:59:29,773 --> 00:59:30,803
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

922
00:59:30,903 --> 00:59:31,943
<font color="yellow">Let's meet.</font>

923
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:37,273
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the declaration you made before.</font>

924
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:39,343
<font color="yellow">Stop seeing Gab Soon.</font>

925
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,003
<font color="yellow">You told me to take action.</font>

926
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,967
<font color="yellow">I'm going to start today.</font>

927
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:46,443
<font color="yellow">I am making it clear to you.</font>

928
00:59:56,743 --> 00:59:59,203
<font color="yellow">I will take care of you...</font>

929
00:59:59,773 --> 01:00:00,873
<font color="yellow">until I am able to.</font>

930
01:00:01,603 --> 01:00:02,643
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

931
01:00:08,203 --> 01:00:09,303
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

932
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:11,573
<font color="yellow">a petition for a marriage license.</font>

933
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:13,903
<font color="yellow">You brought up the word about marriage,</font>

934
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:16,843
<font color="yellow">but I'm going to make the proposal.</font>

935
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,903
<font color="yellow">It seems like he's doing all right.</font>

936
01:00:52,973 --> 01:00:54,873
<font color="yellow">He stirred my heart for nothing.</font>

937
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,273
<font color="yellow">I misjudged him.</font>

938
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:06,143
<font color="yellow">No, he's not changed. I just made a wrong decision.</font>

939
01:01:06,643 --> 01:01:07,743
<font color="yellow">I was so foolish.</font>

940
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:10,273
<font color="yellow">Why did I think that he would be...</font>

941
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:11,973
<font color="yellow">interested in a widow like me?</font>

942
01:01:12,743 --> 01:01:15,373
<font color="yellow">He must have thought I was such a fool.</font>

943
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:22,603
<font color="yellow">I hope you are miserable, you rotten scoundrel.</font>

944
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:30,543
<font color="yellow">For now, we cannot make a conclusion.</font>

945
01:01:31,173 --> 01:01:33,543
<font color="yellow">It's been so long that it's hard to find him.</font>

946
01:01:34,103 --> 01:01:36,903
<font color="yellow">Find him no matter what it takes.</font>

947
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:38,373
<font color="yellow">Whether he's dead or alive.</font>

948
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:40,303
<font color="yellow">If you find him, I will give you double.</font>

949
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:42,603
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I understand. - Please hurry.</font>

950
01:01:45,843 --> 01:01:47,343
<font color="yellow">Where is my Thermos?</font>

951
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:50,003
<font color="yellow">Have you seen the Thermos?</font>

952
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,503
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon took it with her.</font>

953
01:01:53,205 --> 01:01:55,175
<font color="yellow">She put doenjangguk in it.</font>

954
01:01:55,433 --> 01:01:56,933
<font color="yellow">Doenjangguk? Where did she go?</font>

955
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:58,804
<font color="yellow">How can I say this?</font>

956
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:02,303
<font color="yellow">You are so dim.</font>

957
01:02:02,503 --> 01:02:04,803
<font color="yellow">I can hear the wailing.</font>

958
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:09,403
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all. I'm living proof.</font>

959
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,443
<font color="yellow">Is he meeting Geum Sik?</font>

960
01:02:19,473 --> 01:02:21,303
<font color="yellow">- How is it? - This is it.</font>

961
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:25,473
<font color="yellow">Your doenjangguk is fantastic.</font>

962
01:02:28,903 --> 01:02:30,903
<font color="yellow">Eat. You have to get going soon.</font>

963
01:02:31,103 --> 01:02:33,943
<font color="yellow">I wish I can spend all day with you.</font>

964
01:02:35,373 --> 01:02:36,573
<font color="yellow">My heart is pounding.</font>

965
01:02:39,303 --> 01:02:40,443
<font color="yellow">Do you only work in the mornings?</font>

966
01:02:40,603 --> 01:02:43,773
<font color="yellow">I work in the mornings because of Ddol Ee, but more when it's busy.</font>

967
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:46,203
<font color="yellow">Are Cho Rong and Da Rong doing well?</font>

968
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:51,143
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

969
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,903
<font color="yellow">We agreed that we would become good friends...</font>

970
01:02:55,643 --> 01:02:57,743
<font color="yellow">and slowly get to know each other better.</font>

971
01:02:58,103 --> 01:02:59,743
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about our children.</font>

972
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:03,503
<font color="yellow">Let's focus on ourselves when we're together.</font>

973
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,603
<font color="yellow">I remember the first day we met.</font>

974
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:10,443
<font color="yellow">I feel so foolish when I think about that day.</font>

975
01:03:10,903 --> 01:03:11,973
<font color="yellow">As soon as we met,</font>

976
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:14,443
<font color="yellow">I asked you if you could raise my children properly.</font>

977
01:03:15,143 --> 01:03:16,403
<font color="yellow">How could you like someone who says that?</font>

978
01:03:16,673 --> 01:03:18,303
<font color="yellow">Even I think that was ridiculous.</font>

979
01:03:18,673 --> 01:03:20,443
<font color="yellow">I only considered your status.</font>

980
01:03:21,443 --> 01:03:23,743
<font color="yellow">You weren't bad looking.</font>

981
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:27,243
<font color="yellow">Your body is not bad either.</font>

982
01:03:28,373 --> 01:03:29,673
<font color="yellow">Not bad?</font>

983
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:34,503
<font color="yellow">I can't eat.</font>

984
01:03:35,573 --> 01:03:37,773
<font color="yellow">What about me? What did you think of me?</font>

985
01:03:38,973 --> 01:03:41,273
<font color="yellow">- You looked sexy. - Really?</font>

986
01:03:41,543 --> 01:03:42,603
<font color="yellow">Do you not like being sexy?</font>

987
01:03:42,803 --> 01:03:44,943
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't I? I love it.</font>

988
01:03:45,303 --> 01:03:47,343
<font color="yellow">I've never heard anyone say that before.</font>

989
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:49,973
<font color="yellow">People say I seem nice and wholesome.</font>

990
01:03:50,143 --> 01:03:51,743
<font color="yellow">I'm tired of hearing that.</font>

991
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:53,803
<font color="yellow">They say I will make a good wife.</font>

992
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:57,573
<font color="yellow">We've agreed. Let's not talk about kids.</font>

993
01:03:57,873 --> 01:04:00,343
<font color="yellow">When we meet, let's act like people without kids.</font>

994
01:04:00,873 --> 01:04:02,143
<font color="yellow">I'm young, and I have no kids.</font>

995
01:04:11,073 --> 01:04:12,373
<font color="yellow">Hold it still.</font>

996
01:04:12,503 --> 01:04:14,603
<font color="yellow">- My goodness! - Go open the door.</font>

997
01:04:15,703 --> 01:04:17,503
<font color="yellow">Why can't you do it? Who is it?</font>

998
01:04:17,843 --> 01:04:20,303
<font color="yellow">- It's me. - Who could it be?</font>

999
01:04:23,073 --> 01:04:24,173
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

1000
01:04:25,603 --> 01:04:27,903
<font color="yellow">It's me, Se Bang.</font>

1001
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,173
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

1002
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:33,273
<font color="yellow">- Father. - Oh, my.</font>

1003
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:34,843
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

1004
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,303
<font color="yellow">Mr Kim, put those down here.</font>

1005
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:47,843
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

1006
01:04:49,603 --> 01:04:52,373
<font color="yellow">- Wait for me downstairs. - Yes, Sir.</font>

1007
01:04:58,773 --> 01:04:59,873
<font color="yellow">Let me properly greet you.</font>

1008
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:01,943
<font color="yellow">Please sit down.</font>

1009
01:05:02,503 --> 01:05:03,543
<font color="yellow">Let me bow.</font>
