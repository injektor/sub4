<font color="yellow">Soo Jo?</font>

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,870
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo?</font>

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

5
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,170
<font color="yellow">Si Nae, I have...</font>

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,440
<font color="yellow">I have something to confess.</font>

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,270
<font color="yellow">Confess? What is it?</font>

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,140
<font color="yellow">Right here?</font>

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

10
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,570
<font color="yellow">I've been desperately waiting for this moment.</font>

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,110
<font color="yellow">I really wanted...</font>

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,440
<font color="yellow">to say this at a supermarket.</font>

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,610
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,740
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,510
<font color="yellow">- Let's buy some spoons. - What?</font>

16
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,870
<font color="yellow">What's that medicine for? Are you sick?</font>

17
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,810
<font color="yellow">My body aches from fatigue.</font>

18
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,070
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,610
<font color="yellow">You should take it easy. Don't overwork yourself.</font>

20
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,910
<font color="yellow">Health is more important than money.</font>

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,910
<font color="yellow">Come over for a second.</font>

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,570
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

23
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,840
<font color="yellow">I made it for you. It's braised cutlassfish, your favourite.</font>

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,070
<font color="yellow">Come on and eat.</font>

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,410
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mother.</font>

26
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,540
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,210
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,610
<font color="yellow">I know you're young, but don't work too hard.</font>

29
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,170
<font color="yellow">You'll get sick when you get old.</font>

30
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,140
<font color="yellow">I should make money while I'm still young.</font>

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,240
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat?</font>

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,170
<font color="yellow">I had a late lunch. I'm not hungry.</font>

33
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,870
<font color="yellow">I should've made food that you like more often.</font>

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,980
<font color="yellow">I know you're busy too.</font>

35
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,410
<font color="yellow">Things must be hard for you these days.</font>

36
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,410
<font color="yellow">You must've thought you'd be happy after you got married.</font>

37
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,480
<font color="yellow">But Gab Dol doesn't see how hard you work,</font>

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
<font color="yellow">and all I do is nag you.</font>

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,980
<font color="yellow">It's hard, right?</font>

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh. How did you know? That's exactly how I feel.</font>

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,510
<font color="yellow">Do you want to annul your marriage?</font>

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,740
<font color="yellow">I'll have to think about it.</font>

43
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,740
<font color="yellow">Things are actually hard at my company these days.</font>

44
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,980
<font color="yellow">My business isn't going well,</font>

45
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,210
<font color="yellow">but Gab Dol doesn't listen or talk to me.</font>

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,770
<font color="yellow">I've been upset and exhausted.</font>

47
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,440
<font color="yellow">Of course, you would.</font>

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,970
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol should be careful about his behaviour outside.</font>

49
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,570
<font color="yellow">He shouldn't do things you might misunderstand.</font>

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,570
<font color="yellow">Even if he can't do the things you like,</font>

51
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,810
<font color="yellow">he shouldn't do the things you hate at least.</font>

52
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,210
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,270
<font color="yellow">I don't need him to get me a diamond ring,</font>

54
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,770
<font color="yellow">but I hope he won't do the things I hate.</font>

55
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,640
<font color="yellow">I feel...</font>

56
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,270
<font color="yellow">ashamed for everything.</font>

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,910
<font color="yellow">I showed you things you shouldn't have seen.</font>

58
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,610
<font color="yellow">I'm ashamed and embarrassed.</font>

59
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,140
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be.</font>

60
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,170
<font color="yellow">He likes you because you're beautiful and charming.</font>

61
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,010
<font color="yellow">Don't be timid and date him proudly.</font>

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,410
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't let him pay all the expenses on dates.</font>

63
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,940
<font color="yellow">Young people these days always split the check.</font>

64
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,040
<font color="yellow">If he buys you a meal, you should buy him a meal next time.</font>

65
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,370
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

66
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,940
<font color="yellow">Ms Yeo is not a nice person.</font>

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,940
<font color="yellow">You're right. She is so rude.</font>

68
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,470
<font color="yellow">She gave your brother such a hard time.</font>

69
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,170
<font color="yellow">She treated him so harshly, but he was always polite.</font>

70
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,240
<font color="yellow">I was wondering whom his parents were.</font>

71
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,010
<font color="yellow">You really cheered me up today.</font>

72
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,570
<font color="yellow">I feel embarrassed to you,</font>

73
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,970
<font color="yellow">but I also feel so relieved.</font>

74
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,240
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol and you are the best.</font>

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,440
<font color="yellow">Aren't we?</font>

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,640
<font color="yellow">Don't be intimidated. I'm a good fighter too.</font>

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,770
<font color="yellow">I know you are.</font>

78
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,940
<font color="yellow">But you shouldn't...</font>

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,510
<font color="yellow">tell Gab Dol about this.</font>

80
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,240
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's okay to tell a daughter, but he's not.</font>

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,910
<font color="yellow">I understand what you mean.</font>

82
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,510
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,310
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

84
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,070
<font color="yellow">I got off work late.</font>

85
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,870
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

86
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,870
<font color="yellow">- What? - Why aren't you greeting your wife?</font>

87
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,640
<font color="yellow">She's not greeting me either. We don't even talk to each other.</font>

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,340
<font color="yellow">That's not something to be proud of. Don't sleep in separate rooms.</font>

89
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,310
<font color="yellow">Listening to your wife only brings you fortune.</font>

90
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,570
<font color="yellow">You can't find a woman better than Gab Soon.</font>

91
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,780
<font color="yellow">She's pretty, successful,</font>

92
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,940
<font color="yellow">smart and a good fighter.</font>

93
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,570
<font color="yellow">You don't realise how lucky you are.</font>

94
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,140
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - Why do you sleep separately?</font>

95
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,010
<font color="yellow">- You didn't even do well in school. - You're right.</font>

96
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,970
<font color="yellow">Why would you bring that up?</font>

97
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,110
<font color="yellow">I still passed the exam for 3,000 percent.</font>

98
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,140
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon didn't.</font>

99
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,940
<font color="yellow">You had studied for 10 years while doing nothing,</font>

100
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,840
<font color="yellow">but Gab Soon had part-time jobs while studying. It's different.</font>

101
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,040
<font color="yellow">No one except Gab Soon would have supported you for 10 years...</font>

102
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,540
<font color="yellow">when you were jobless.</font>

103
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,870
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even get her a house on your own.</font>

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,940
<font color="yellow">Mum. Look at her being all smug.</font>

105
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,210
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

106
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,970
<font color="yellow">If Gab Soon were still single,</font>

107
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,340
<font color="yellow">guys who already have apartments would line up to marry her.</font>

108
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,170
<font color="yellow">Mother, you're the best.</font>

109
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,040
<font color="yellow">You're only a public official.</font>

110
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,470
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't even have become one if it wasn't for her support.</font>

111
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,540
<font color="yellow">You should treat her a lot better than this.</font>

112
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,910
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

113
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,870
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that, honey?</font>

114
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,570
<font color="yellow">Get the blankets and go to your room.</font>

115
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,240
<font color="yellow">Sleep in a separate room again, and I'll give you a good scolding.</font>

116
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,640
<font color="yellow">What on earth did you do?</font>

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,370
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything.</font>

118
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,370
<font color="yellow">- Did you give her money? - No.</font>

119
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I'm totally surprised.</font>

120
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,170
<font color="yellow">You turned the tables around completely.</font>

121
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,910
<font color="yellow">Mother has worked hard her whole life.</font>

122
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,010
<font color="yellow">Now that you're married,</font>

123
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,210
<font color="yellow">don't make me upset...</font>

124
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,940
<font color="yellow">and be good to your mother.</font>

125
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,810
<font color="yellow">What's up with you?</font>

126
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,640
<font color="yellow">You always got angry when I said my mum has worked hard.</font>

127
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,610
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,210
<font color="yellow">My dear wife.</font>

129
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,340
<font color="yellow">You're finally being nice.</font>

130
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,910
<font color="yellow">Don't you think...</font>

131
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,640
<font color="yellow">Mother would be lonely if she lived alone?</font>

132
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,810
<font color="yellow">Why would she live alone? She has us.</font>

133
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,340
<font color="yellow">It's a different matter.</font>

134
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,010
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

135
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,370
<font color="yellow">My mum won't be lonely.</font>

136
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,610
<font color="yellow">She's living with us. Why would she be?</font>

137
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,140
<font color="yellow">You're saying silly things now that you're close with her.</font>

138
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,910
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

139
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,340
<font color="yellow">What were you doing? You didn't answer your phone.</font>

140
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,140
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

141
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,210
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you busy?</font>

142
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,710
<font color="yellow">I can't really talk now. I'll call you later.</font>

143
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,210
<font color="yellow">Can we talk?</font>

144
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,070
<font color="yellow">Why did you take this out?</font>

145
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,110
<font color="yellow">You keep it in your drawer and wear it when you go out to see Ms Nam.</font>

146
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,770
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to do this? It's disgraceful.</font>

147
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,170
<font color="yellow">What does grace have anything to do with dating?</font>

148
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,170
<font color="yellow">Were you graceful when seeing a guy?</font>

149
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,310
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about this with you.</font>

150
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,310
<font color="yellow">Sit down. Don't pretend to be naive.</font>

151
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,410
<font color="yellow">We're both old enough to talk about anything.</font>

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
<font color="yellow">I said sit down.</font>

153
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,310
<font color="yellow">She deceived you once. Do you want to be deceived again?</font>

154
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,470
<font color="yellow">How can you still be seeing her? You even kept it a secret.</font>

155
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,740
<font color="yellow">We only get one life,</font>

156
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,940
<font color="yellow">and there is not much to it.</font>

157
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,640
<font color="yellow">Nothing is better than living each day happily.</font>

158
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,770
<font color="yellow">You can't take money with you when you die.</font>

159
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,640
<font color="yellow">Please come to your senses.</font>

160
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,040
<font color="yellow">I already have.</font>

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,410
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to marry her. I'm just going to date her.</font>

162
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,410
<font color="yellow">There is no problem with dating her, is there?</font>

163
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,910
<font color="yellow">You're just saying it now that you won't marry her.</font>

164
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,170
<font color="yellow">Does she really want to date you even if she can't get your money?</font>

165
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,740
<font color="yellow">Why would she want to do that?</font>

166
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,510
<font color="yellow">- What? - To be honest,</font>

167
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,010
<font color="yellow">I don't get why someone so much younger than you...</font>

168
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,470
<font color="yellow">would want to date an old man like you.</font>

169
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,040
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

170
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,440
<font color="yellow">an old man can't be loved by a woman?</font>

171
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,640
<font color="yellow">Don't argue about my age.</font>

172
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,910
<font color="yellow">You can go now.</font>

173
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,540
<font color="yellow">You think I'm just worried about your money, right?</font>

174
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,540
<font color="yellow">What is it then?</font>

175
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,110
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if she betrays you after you put...</font>

176
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,410
<font color="yellow">all your trust in her?</font>

177
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,570
<font color="yellow">This isn't just about your money.</font>

178
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,240
<font color="yellow">How are you...</font>

179
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,010
<font color="yellow">going to endure it if you get hurt and betrayed by someone at this age?</font>

180
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,010
<font color="yellow">Have you thought about that?</font>

181
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,940
<font color="yellow">When you're young,</font>

182
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,470
<font color="yellow">you can just get over it and move onto someone else.</font>

183
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,410
<font color="yellow">But you don't get another chance when you're old.</font>

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
<font color="yellow">If she betrays and hurts you, you won't be able to bear it.</font>

185
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,410
<font color="yellow">Why are you outside?</font>

186
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,070
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

187
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,470
<font color="yellow">Did you miss me that much?</font>

188
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,840
<font color="yellow">You should've waited inside. It's cold. Let's go in.</font>

189
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,880
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

190
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,970
<font color="yellow">Let's go somewhere and talk.</font>

191
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,540
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

192
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,570
<font color="yellow">I don't wish for much.</font>

193
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,010
<font color="yellow">I just want you to be happy.</font>

194
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,070
<font color="yellow">- The woman that you're seeing... - Give me a little more time.</font>

195
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,170
<font color="yellow">I'll introduce her to you soon.</font>

196
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,140
<font color="yellow">You don't need to.</font>

197
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,270
<font color="yellow">I won't meet her.</font>

198
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,810
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

199
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,010
<font color="yellow">If you like her, I will like her too.</font>

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,340
<font color="yellow">But it can't be the woman you're seeing right now.</font>

201
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,940
<font color="yellow">I went grocery shopping and saw you at the supermarket.</font>

202
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,640
<font color="yellow">Whose babies were they? They looked like twins.</font>

203
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,570
<font color="yellow">They're her babies, right?</font>

204
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,310
<font color="yellow">- Soo Jo. - Listen to me first.</font>

205
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,910
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to hear from you. I don't want to hear anything.</font>

206
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,970
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you first once I have everything figured out.</font>

207
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,140
<font color="yellow">She's a nice woman.</font>

208
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,070
<font color="yellow">She became a single mother due to unfortunate circumstances,</font>

209
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,510
<font color="yellow">but she never thought about abandoning her children.</font>

210
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,370
<font color="yellow">She struggles to make ends meet, but she's so good to the boys.</font>

211
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,510
<font color="yellow">Everybody might disapprove of us, but I need you to take my side.</font>

212
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,340
<font color="yellow">She makes me laugh just like you do.</font>

213
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,610
<font color="yellow">I don't like how you said that.</font>

214
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,240
<font color="yellow">Are you putting me on the same level as her?</font>

215
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,640
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

216
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,640
<font color="yellow">End it off before it gets too far. Before the others find out.</font>

217
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,910
<font color="yellow">You know how it'll go if your mum and grandpa find out.</font>

218
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,240
<font color="yellow">I can't take your side.</font>

219
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,410
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam.</font>

220
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,970
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam.</font>

221
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,570
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

222
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,110
<font color="yellow">It's Do Geum.</font>

223
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,740
<font color="yellow">Can you let me in?</font>

224
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,310
<font color="yellow">What's going on? It's late.</font>

225
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,870
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam.</font>

226
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,910
<font color="yellow">Let's have some soju.</font>

227
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,810
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

228
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,170
<font color="yellow">She's seeing a girl with two children?</font>

229
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,270
<font color="yellow">They're twins.</font>

230
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,110
<font color="yellow">There are so many women out there. Why her?</font>

231
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,140
<font color="yellow">Look at him. After all you did to raise him.</font>

232
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,510
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even care. What's wrong with him?</font>

233
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,440
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

234
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,440
<font color="yellow">Once Soo Jo makes up his mind, he doesn't get swayed at all.</font>

235
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,810
<font color="yellow">He's heading straight for trouble.</font>

236
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,010
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

237
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,440
<font color="yellow">Does he lack something?</font>

238
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,310
<font color="yellow">You said he works at the office.</font>

239
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,010
<font color="yellow">His mum will go nuts once she finds out.</font>

240
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,640
<font color="yellow">How's the family?</font>

241
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,510
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you about it another time.</font>

242
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,240
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol married a girl you disapproved of.</font>

243
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,210
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

244
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,070
<font color="yellow">Now that I think of it, I don't know why I disapproved of it.</font>

245
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,770
<font color="yellow">You must be very satisfied with your daughter-in-law.</font>

246
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,440
<font color="yellow">That's not even the point.</font>

247
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,110
<font color="yellow">It's either you disapprove until the end and split them apart,</font>

248
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,640
<font color="yellow">or pretend...</font>

249
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,540
<font color="yellow">as if you like them from the beginning. It's either of those two.</font>

250
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,740
<font color="yellow">I initially disapproved, but I let them marry.</font>

251
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,570
<font color="yellow">We already hurt each other. It's not ideal for neither of us.</font>

252
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,540
<font color="yellow">- See you later. - See you again.</font>

253
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,870
<font color="yellow">All right. Goodbye.</font>

254
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,340
<font color="yellow">She's been missing for over a month.</font>

255
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,740
<font color="yellow">Can't you just check whether she's dead or alive?</font>

256
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,110
<font color="yellow">You don't have to tell me.</font>

257
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,270
<font color="yellow">It's been over a month since we got in contact with her.</font>

258
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,510
<font color="yellow">She could have gotten into an accident or something.</font>

259
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,570
<font color="yellow">She ran away due to family problems. You have no choice but to wait.</font>

260
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,110
<font color="yellow">I just want you to check whether she's dead or alive.</font>

261
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,740
<font color="yellow">We can't do that.</font>

262
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,270
<font color="yellow">Are you her husband?</font>

263
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,310
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

264
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,140
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for her then?</font>

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,970
<font color="yellow">We can't do it.</font>

266
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,170
<font color="yellow">We can't do it even if you were her parent or husband.</font>

267
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,140
<font color="yellow">We can't tell you even if we knew.</font>

268
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,570
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee.</font>

269
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,370
<font color="yellow">- Grandpa. - Oh dear.</font>

270
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,910
<font color="yellow">My baby. How are you?</font>

271
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,140
<font color="yellow">My baby.</font>

272
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,310
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

273
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,110
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since I had meat.</font>

274
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,910
<font color="yellow">Mum only gives me gimbap.</font>

275
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,110
<font color="yellow">She says I have to eat the leftovers so that they don't go to waste.</font>

276
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,970
<font color="yellow">Did you eat gimbap every day?</font>

277
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,010
<font color="yellow">Mum hit me.</font>

278
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,340
<font color="yellow">She hit you? Why?</font>

279
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,440
<font color="yellow">I stole my friend's bread.</font>

280
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,740
<font color="yellow">She hit me here.</font>

281
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,310
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof, it's true.</font>

282
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,210
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

283
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,440
<font color="yellow">Did it hurt?</font>

284
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,170
<font color="yellow">It did. I want to live with you.</font>

285
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,140
<font color="yellow">Okay. Live with me.</font>

286
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,440
<font color="yellow">Let's go to my house in a few days.</font>

287
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,640
<font color="yellow">But don't tell Mum.</font>

288
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,040
<font color="yellow">It's a secret between us.</font>

289
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,640
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

290
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,710
<font color="yellow">Hello. It's delivery.</font>

291
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,840
<font color="yellow">You can leave it there.</font>

292
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,540
<font color="yellow">You must have a lot of customers.</font>

293
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,340
<font color="yellow">Everybody says your dishes are tasty.</font>

294
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,440
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

295
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,870
<font color="yellow">Is it expensive to open a business like this?</font>

296
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,410
<font color="yellow">You can start off in a small space so it's not expensive,</font>

297
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,010
<font color="yellow">but you need to be a good cook.</font>

298
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,010
<font color="yellow">If it tastes good, customers will come.</font>

299
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,340
<font color="yellow">Home-cooked meals are the best.</font>

300
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
<font color="yellow">Don't find me again.</font>

301
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,310
<font color="yellow">I want a refund.</font>

302
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,040
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

303
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,440
<font color="yellow">- I want a refund. - Why?</font>

304
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,080
<font color="yellow">- They don't taste good. - Sorry?</font>

305
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,310
<font color="yellow">You bought two yesterday. You can't just return these.</font>

306
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,440
<font color="yellow">I tried it, and it was so bad. I can't eat it.</font>

307
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,470
<font color="yellow">I want a refund.</font>

308
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,310
<font color="yellow">You only brought two pieces back. I can't refund this.</font>

309
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,370
<font color="yellow">What? Are you saying no?</font>

310
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,410
<font color="yellow">No, I can't.</font>

311
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,810
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You're just a part-timer.</font>

312
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,810
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to listen to the customer.</font>

313
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,910
<font color="yellow">Haven't you heard, "Customers are the kings"? What a fool.</font>

314
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,910
<font color="yellow">I may be a fool, but I know enough.</font>

315
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,580
<font color="yellow">Look at this woman. You don't know what you're saying.</font>

316
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,640
<font color="yellow">Think about it, ma'am.</font>

317
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,240
<font color="yellow">You bought 2 cutlassfish and you only brought 2 pieces back.</font>

318
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,910
<font color="yellow">Does it make sense that I refund you for it?</font>

319
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,170
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

320
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,840
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

321
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,710
<font color="yellow">I need to report you to Consumer Protection.</font>

322
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,840
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

323
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,340
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you report or accuse me.</font>

324
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,080
<font color="yellow">I can't give you a refund.</font>

325
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,810
<font color="yellow">You're not going to sell fish today. Close the shop.</font>

326
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,240
<font color="yellow">I'll report you to the police for interrupting business.</font>

327
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,040
<font color="yellow">What? Hey, come here!</font>

328
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,580
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

329
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,840
<font color="yellow">Behave yourself!</font>

330
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,170
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

331
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,510
<font color="yellow">This is nonsense!</font>

332
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,810
<font color="yellow">- Let go! - Let go of her!</font>

333
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,810
<font color="yellow">Let go of her! I can't believe this!</font>

334
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,040
<font color="yellow">- You! - Let go of her!</font>

335
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,710
<font color="yellow">- Let go of her! - My goodness!</font>

336
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,510
<font color="yellow">You can't treat me like this!</font>

337
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,470
<font color="yellow">Is this the police?</font>

338
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,080
<font color="yellow">- Is this the police? - You can't...</font>

339
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,540
<font color="yellow">- talk to me like that! - I'm calling from a market.</font>

340
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me! - A woman made a complaint,</font>

341
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,740
<font color="yellow">- and it turned into a big fight. - Stop it!</font>

342
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh, really!</font>

343
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,370
<font color="yellow">You're bad luck.</font>

344
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,770
<font color="yellow">You better run your business well.</font>

345
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,740
<font color="yellow">- For goodness' sake! - She's running away.</font>

346
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,770
<font color="yellow">Get up. Get up.</font>

347
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,740
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have come here.</font>

348
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,840
<font color="yellow">I abandoned you.</font>

349
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,940
<font color="yellow">Whether I live of die is none of your business. Go back.</font>

350
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,710
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you take Ddol Ee along with you?</font>

351
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,470
<font color="yellow">What did Jae Soon say?</font>

352
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,910
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even start.</font>

353
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,610
<font color="yellow">She didn't even look at me.</font>

354
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,540
<font color="yellow">She has changed so much.</font>

355
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,040
<font color="yellow">She doesn't feel like our child.</font>

356
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,370
<font color="yellow">I think we made her become that way.</font>

357
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,210
<font color="yellow">How can we make her feel better?</font>

358
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,940
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

359
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,370
<font color="yellow">A woman asked for a refund after buying two whole fish.</font>

360
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,110
<font color="yellow">She only brought two pieces back.</font>

361
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,810
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

362
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,340
<font color="yellow">She sells gimbap in the morning...</font>

363
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,110
<font color="yellow">and works at a fish store during the day.</font>

364
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,740
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

365
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,970
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

366
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,710
<font color="yellow">Weren't you sleeping?</font>

367
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,370
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you a secret.</font>

368
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,770
<font color="yellow">Grandpa came to see me at school.</font>

369
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,010
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

370
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,710
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, weren't you sleeping?</font>

371
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,010
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

372
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,440
<font color="yellow">I can't fall asleep.</font>

373
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,770
<font color="yellow">What if something happened to Ms Shin?</font>

374
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,570
<font color="yellow">I think she changed her number. I can't reach her.</font>

375
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,210
<font color="yellow">What if something went wrong?</font>

376
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,110
<font color="yellow">No way. We'll find her no matter what.</font>

377
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,510
<font color="yellow">Are you hungry? Shall I make you some noodles?</font>

378
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,640
<font color="yellow">I'll cook it myself.</font>

379
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,710
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep. You have school tomorrow.</font>

380
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,310
<font color="yellow">When did you come home?</font>

381
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,110
<font color="yellow">Were you looking for her again?</font>

382
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,310
<font color="yellow">Do you not even eat?</font>

383
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,140
<font color="yellow">Do you know what you're like these days?</font>

384
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,370
<font color="yellow">You're struggling to find a woman like that.</font>

385
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,510
<font color="yellow">Watch what you're saying.</font>

386
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,040
<font color="yellow">What will you do when you find her?</font>

387
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,640
<font color="yellow">Will you live with her?</font>

388
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,640
<font color="yellow">She dumped you for her ex-husband. What will you do?</font>

389
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,940
<font color="yellow">I don't get you.</font>

390
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,940
<font color="yellow">You deserve a much better woman. She's not worth it.</font>

391
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,210
<font color="yellow">You have such low standards for women.</font>

392
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,240
<font color="yellow">What did you like about her when you were married?</font>

393
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,940
<font color="yellow">- Stop. - You should stop.</font>

394
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,270
<font color="yellow">She left you because you lived on the rooftop.</font>

395
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,540
<font color="yellow">You're so annoying.</font>

396
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,710
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch, we were supposed to meet today.</font>

397
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,240
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get my text?</font>

398
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,070
<font color="yellow">I can't see you for a while.</font>

399
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,240
<font color="yellow">Why not? What happened?</font>

400
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,770
<font color="yellow">Aren't you feeling well?</font>

401
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,040
<font color="yellow">There's no need to worry, but I can't go out.</font>

402
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,510
<font color="yellow">Did my daughter go there?</font>

403
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,310
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

404
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,510
<font color="yellow">Then what is it? Shall I go to your place?</font>

405
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,540
<font color="yellow">Don't come.</font>

406
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,710
<font color="yellow">I had a little argument with my son.</font>

407
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,840
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

408
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,310
<font color="yellow">He talks about how much he respects you for all your struggles in life.</font>

409
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,440
<font color="yellow">Why did you argue with him?</font>

410
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,470
<font color="yellow">Hang up. I'll call you later.</font>

411
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,640
<font color="yellow">Relief Patch. Relief Patch.</font>

412
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,610
<font color="yellow">Sir, people under you are supposed to carry things like this.</font>

413
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,540
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

414
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,510
<font color="yellow">Let's eat fish cakes.</font>

415
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,470
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

416
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,510
<font color="yellow">What if people find out?</font>

417
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,040
<font color="yellow">It's okay. We're working.</font>

418
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,010
<font color="yellow">- Just working? - I was.</font>

419
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,270
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you have other intentions?</font>

420
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so good at this.</font>

421
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,140
<font color="yellow">I told you I'm good.</font>

422
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,610
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

423
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,840
<font color="yellow">Hello, ma'am.</font>

424
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
<font color="yellow">Why did you get off from the same car?</font>

425
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,070
<font color="yellow">I told Ms Ban to come see some fabrics together.</font>

426
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,570
<font color="yellow">We just came back.</font>

427
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,240
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

428
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,270
<font color="yellow">You worked hard today. You may go now.</font>

429
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

430
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,710
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later, ma'am.</font>

431
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,370
<font color="yellow">It's nice that you're working hard,</font>

432
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,840
<font color="yellow">but people may misunderstand, so don't get along with her.</font>

433
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,540
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful.</font>

434
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,640
<font color="yellow">You're ready to bathe the boys, right?</font>

435
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,940
<font color="yellow">I'll go now.</font>

436
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,340
<font color="yellow">You can go home now, right?</font>

437
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,770
<font color="yellow">What brings you here? You didn't even call.</font>

438
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,340
<font color="yellow">I met someone nearby. I came to go home with you.</font>

439
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,410
<font color="yellow">I have an appointment.</font>

440
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,770
<font color="yellow">I came all the way here. You're asking me to go alone?</font>

441
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,610
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

442
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,470
<font color="yellow">Something came up suddenly. I'm sorry.</font>

443
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,140
<font color="yellow">Il Ho and Ee Ho.</font>

444
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,470
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo can't come today.</font>

445
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,570
<font color="yellow">Let's just bathe without him.</font>

446
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,240
<font color="yellow">You miss him, don't you?</font>

447
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,770
<font color="yellow">I do too.</font>

448
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,740
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

449
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,310
<font color="yellow">- You came on purpose, didn't you? - Yes, I did.</font>

450
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,840
<font color="yellow">That won't change anything.</font>

451
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,540
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

452
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,210
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa,</font>

453
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,810
<font color="yellow">open the door. Somebody's here.</font>

454
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,040
<font color="yellow">How dare you come here? Get out.</font>

455
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,140
<font color="yellow">The adults are here, right?</font>

456
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,640
<font color="yellow">I said get out.</font>

457
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,610
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

458
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,610
<font color="yellow">How disrespectful.</font>

459
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,110
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see the adults. How dare you do this to me?</font>

460
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,810
<font color="yellow">Get out. How dare you come here?</font>

461
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,170
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

462
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,640
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

463
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,910
<font color="yellow">Come on out.</font>

464
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,640
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

465
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,640
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Don't do that.</font>

466
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,070
<font color="yellow">Don't meddle in our business.</font>

467
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,570
<font color="yellow">This isn't right!</font>

468
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,610
<font color="yellow">How could he visit the house?</font>

469
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,940
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

470
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,770
<font color="yellow">Why do you care?</font>

471
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,640
<font color="yellow">I care because I can.</font>

472
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,440
<font color="yellow">Let go of him.</font>

473
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,070
<font color="yellow">You can't do this at my house. Let go.</font>

474
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,110
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

475
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,770
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't behave like this to an elder.</font>

476
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,170
<font color="yellow">Don't ever do that again. You may go now.</font>

477
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I'm so dishevelled.</font>

478
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,270
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

479
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,410
<font color="yellow">I don't want your bow.</font>

480
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,270
<font color="yellow">Sit down. Let's hear what you have to say.</font>

481
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,770
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon isn't even home. Just tell him to leave.</font>

482
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,710
<font color="yellow">Let me introduce myself.</font>

483
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,370
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Sam Sik.</font>

484
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,710
<font color="yellow">Bring us some tea.</font>

485
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,810
<font color="yellow">What tea?</font>

486
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,840
<font color="yellow">Please give me a cup of tea.</font>

487
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,940
<font color="yellow">Bring it out.</font>

488
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,270
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

489
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,840
<font color="yellow">- Sit down. - Okay.</font>

490
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,510
<font color="yellow">Why does Mal Nyeon meet a man who's just like herself?</font>

491
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,010
<font color="yellow">Why did you come to our house?</font>

492
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,370
<font color="yellow">My nose hurts.</font>

493
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,340
<font color="yellow">I thought my nose broke,</font>

494
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,210
<font color="yellow">but it's a tiny fracture.</font>

495
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,640
<font color="yellow">I would've sued you if you were someone else,</font>

496
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,970
<font color="yellow">but since you're Mal Nyeon's brother, I'm letting it go.</font>

497
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,840
<font color="yellow">Did you hit him?</font>

498
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,970
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

499
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,270
<font color="yellow">I believe Mal Nyeon and I are meant to be.</font>

500
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,070
<font color="yellow">We are made for each other.</font>

501
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,940
<font color="yellow">I looked for her for 30 years, and it was worth it.</font>

502
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,270
<font color="yellow">- My nose. - 30 years?</font>

503
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,310
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon and I met 30 years ago.</font>

504
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,610
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear?</font>

505
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,770
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

506
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,340
<font color="yellow">Then you didn't meet her by the dumpster recently?</font>

507
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,510
<font color="yellow">You were the...</font>

508
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,940
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this guy.</font>

509
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,110
<font color="yellow">How can you shamelessly follow her here?</font>

510
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,440
<font color="yellow">Just keep quiet.</font>

511
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,140
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? This is ridiculous.</font>

512
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,970
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon even set the wedding date. Because of him...</font>

513
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,240
<font color="yellow">I'm right. He's the...</font>

514
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,570
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

515
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,810
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

516
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,870
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

517
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,740
<font color="yellow">Let's say you've been looking for her for 30 years.</font>

518
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,840
<font color="yellow">What will you do now?</font>

519
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,340
<font color="yellow">I'll live with her.</font>

520
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,840
<font color="yellow">I'll right the wrong I did to her...</font>

521
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
<font color="yellow">even though she did me wrong too.</font>

522
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,140
<font color="yellow">What did she do wrong?</font>

523
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,140
<font color="yellow">I never knew she set up a wedding date.</font>

524
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,010
<font color="yellow">I was the one who was fooled.</font>

525
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,970
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be a man if I said this now, but I'll say it.</font>

526
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,610
<font color="yellow">I told her I'd be back and asked her to wait for me.</font>

527
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,640
<font color="yellow">I went to her after I was discharged,</font>

528
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,640
<font color="yellow">but she was already married and gone.</font>

529
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,740
<font color="yellow">My life became a mess after that.</font>

530
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,640
<font color="yellow">My nose hurts.</font>

531
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,810
<font color="yellow">Mal Nyeon is trouble.</font>

532
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,310
<font color="yellow">- Where is she? - She went to the sauna.</font>

533
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,710
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

534
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,210
<font color="yellow">you didn't get married?</font>

535
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,740
<font color="yellow">I never did because I couldn't forget her.</font>

536
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,710
<font color="yellow">You must've saved up quite a bit then.</font>

537
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,240
<font color="yellow">Since you didn't have any children or wife to support.</font>

538
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,310
<font color="yellow">What do you do now?</font>

539
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,010
<font color="yellow">- A club... - Do you own a club?</font>

540
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,610
<font color="yellow">No, I don't own it.</font>

541
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:14,170
<font color="yellow">I console the hearts of the lonely elderly people.</font>

542
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,070
<font color="yellow">I help two lonely hearts spend the rest of their lives...</font>

543
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,370
<font color="yellow">What is he saying?</font>

544
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,370
<font color="yellow">Are you like a matchmaker?</font>

545
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,840
<font color="yellow">You can say that.</font>

546
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,640
<font color="yellow">He's a waiter at a club.</font>

547
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,240
<font color="yellow">Do you have a house?</font>

548
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,010
<font color="yellow">I'm not greedy for a house since I'm single.</font>

549
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,570
<font color="yellow">So where do you live now?</font>

550
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,410
<font color="yellow">Have you heard of...</font>

551
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,980
<font color="yellow">goshiwon?</font>

552
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,570
<font color="yellow">- Leave. - Goodness.</font>

553
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,940
<font color="yellow">I can't help but say, "Goodness."</font>

554
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,840
<font color="yellow">Is this why she became living proof?</font>

555
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,540
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I'm sorry but leave now.</font>

556
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,640
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

557
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,110
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming out from there?</font>

558
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,170
<font color="yellow">I introduced myself to your brother...</font>

559
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,240
<font color="yellow">and told him everything. My nose...</font>

560
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,040
<font color="yellow">What everything?</font>

561
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,810
<font color="yellow">You lied and seduced me when I was in the army.</font>

562
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,770
<font color="yellow">You had someone you were going to marry.</font>

563
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,510
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

564
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,940
<font color="yellow">You're crazy! You're mad!</font>

565
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,810
<font color="yellow">You're crazy!</font>

566
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

567
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,770
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon. I heard Sam Sik was here.</font>

568
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,910
<font color="yellow">How can you meet a man like that?</font>

569
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,940
<font color="yellow">You twisted your own fate.</font>

570
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,770
<font color="yellow">How could you do that when you even had a wedding date?</font>

571
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,870
<font color="yellow">- Did you tell him about Dal Pa? - No.</font>

572
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,980
<font color="yellow">You should tell him. He's the real dad.</font>

573
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,910
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa should know his real dad.</font>

574
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,270
<font color="yellow">It isn't something you should hide.</font>

575
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,910
<font color="yellow">Whether he's good or bad, he's the father.</font>

576
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,740
<font color="yellow">No way. If Dal Pa finds out, he'll kill me.</font>

577
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,210
<font color="yellow">Well, he had nothing to show for his life.</font>

578
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,270
<font color="yellow">He lives in a goshiwon...</font>

579
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,740
<font color="yellow">and works as a waiter at a club. That's absurd.</font>

580
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,110
<font color="yellow">Don't even mention that.</font>

581
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,270
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you'll do to Dal Pa.</font>

582
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,740
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hurt him any more.</font>

583
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,640
<font color="yellow">He's a member of the Go family no matter what.</font>

584
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,440
<font color="yellow">I even had a wedding date set,</font>

585
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,510
<font color="yellow">but I had Dal Pa with some other guy. If Dal Pa finds out,</font>

586
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,710
<font color="yellow">he won't treat me like human.</font>

587
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,540
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

588
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,370
<font color="yellow">Sam Sik won't stay quiet either.</font>

589
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,810
<font color="yellow">If he finds out that Dal Pa is his son,</font>

590
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,480
<font color="yellow">he'll follow Dal Pa around right away.</font>

591
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,370
<font color="yellow">I would've supported Sam Sik if he had anything.</font>

592
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,440
<font color="yellow">How can he live in a goshiwon?</font>

593
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,840
<font color="yellow">Plus, he's a waiter who does this at a club.</font>

594
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,840
<font color="yellow">That'd be the customer. A waiter says,</font>

595
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,070
<font color="yellow">"Welcome," and "do you want me to find you a partner?"</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm the firstborn. I feel ashamed.</font>

610
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,110
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to see me like this.</font>

611
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,110
<font color="yellow">I was living with my parents after the divorce without any money.</font>

612
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,980
<font color="yellow">My parents and siblings looked down on me.</font>

613
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,740
<font color="yellow">It wasn't like that.</font>

614
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,770
<font color="yellow">People are all the same.</font>

615
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,640
<font color="yellow">That hurts.</font>

616
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,540
<font color="yellow">I depended on you whenever I had hardships.</font>

617
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,010
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call me?</font>

618
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,480
<font color="yellow">Don't I mean anything to you?</font>

619
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,040
<font color="yellow">- Ddol Ee is waiting for me. - I want to see him.</font>

620
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,910
<font color="yellow">No. Just go home.</font>

621
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,870
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon. You should at least keep in touch with me.</font>

622
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,270
<font color="yellow">You'll be too lonely living in an unfamiliar place like this.</font>

623
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,010
<font color="yellow">You need a person to call if anything goes wrong.</font>

624
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,840
<font color="yellow">- Why would I call someone? - Don't say that.</font>

625
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,270
<font color="yellow">I'll come running if you call me.</font>

626
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,340
<font color="yellow">I think our parents went overboard.</font>

627
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,910
<font color="yellow">They should've told you even if it was for you.</font>

628
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,170
<font color="yellow">If you hate them, don't meet them for a while.</font>

629
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,840
<font color="yellow">Nobody will scold you.</font>

630
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,270
<font color="yellow">But let's keep in touch, okay?</font>

631
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,770
<font color="yellow">- Did you get her number? - Yes.</font>

632
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,870
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

633
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,870
<font color="yellow">I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.</font>

634
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,870
<font color="yellow">Only I should call her.</font>

635
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,870
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much. I'm sure she'll come around.</font>

636
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,640
<font color="yellow">She's not a mean person.</font>

637
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,810
<font color="yellow">She's the meanest one in the family.</font>

638
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,740
<font color="yellow">It's a relief.</font>

639
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,640
<font color="yellow">She opened up her heart a bit, and that's good.</font>

640
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,810
<font color="yellow">You should visit her often.</font>

641
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,210
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

642
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,370
<font color="yellow">What do we tell Geum Sik? Shouldn't we tell him?</font>

643
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,510
<font color="yellow">You can't.</font>

644
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,340
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon told me not to say anything.</font>

645
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,410
<font color="yellow">She won't see me if I do.</font>

646
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,870
<font color="yellow">I can understand her.</font>

647
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,480
<font color="yellow">She probably doesn't want to see Geum Sik the most.</font>

648
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,640
<font color="yellow">Are women like that?</font>

649
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,610
<font color="yellow">- Of course. - Of course.</font>

650
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,870
<font color="yellow">Men aren't like that?</font>

651
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,710
<font color="yellow">I'd feel sorry.</font>

652
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,980
<font color="yellow">If my ex isn't doing well,</font>

653
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,770
<font color="yellow">I'd feel bad and want to help her.</font>

654
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,870
<font color="yellow">I guess he has someone like her somewhere.</font>

655
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,340
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't say that.</font>

656
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:10,110
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik wouldn't look for her like we did. He's not family.</font>

657
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,210
<font color="yellow">Is it over between him and Jae Soon?</font>

658
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,540
<font color="yellow">We can't do anything.</font>

659
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,710
<font color="yellow">If that's their fate, so be it.</font>

660
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,010
<font color="yellow">Go home. You said you were busy.</font>

661
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,170
<font color="yellow">By the way, it's the same family.</font>

662
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,770
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

663
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,770
<font color="yellow">The old man my mother-in-law is dating.</font>

664
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,480
<font color="yellow">It's Se Gye's grandpa-in-law.</font>

665
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,910
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

666
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,340
<font color="yellow">My mother-in-law used to work for that family.</font>

667
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,610
<font color="yellow">They must've fallen in love while she worked there.</font>

668
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,110
<font color="yellow">That woman came and made a huge fuss again.</font>

669
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,910
<font color="yellow">Didn't they break up?</font>

670
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,040
<font color="yellow">They've been dating secretly.</font>

671
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,070
<font color="yellow">His daughter is too much.</font>

672
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,410
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't she just let them date?</font>

673
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
<font color="yellow">What does she know about life?</font>

674
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,070
<font color="yellow">It's because of money.</font>

675
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,270
<font color="yellow">If he was a penniless, old man,</font>

676
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,410
<font color="yellow">she would have jumped for joy.</font>

677
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,140
<font color="yellow">But there's something strange about it.</font>

678
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,340
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

679
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,980
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I should say this.</font>

680
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,640
<font color="yellow">Say it. What is it?</font>

681
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,440
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anybody else.</font>

682
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,570
<font color="yellow">I saw a man...</font>

683
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,240
<font color="yellow">coming out of her room late at night.</font>

684
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,110
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

685
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,980
<font color="yellow">That old man dropped by late at night?</font>

686
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,140
<font color="yellow">My goodness. In the same house where you guys live?</font>

687
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,010
<font color="yellow">It wasn't him.</font>

688
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,070
<font color="yellow">It looked like a younger man.</font>

689
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,440
<font color="yellow">He looked about Mother's age.</font>

690
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,440
<font color="yellow">She's cheating on him.</font>

691
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,570
<font color="yellow">That's indecent.</font>

692
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,740
<font color="yellow">Play dumb.</font>

693
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,910
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

694
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,040
<font color="yellow">He slipped out at night.</font>

695
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,510
<font color="yellow">Is she dating the old man for money...</font>

696
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,570
<font color="yellow">and seeing another man at night?</font>

697
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,440
<font color="yellow">That's skill.</font>

698
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,870
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

699
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,640
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

700
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,770
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

701
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,440
<font color="yellow">This isn't why I've become living proof.</font>

702
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,040
<font color="yellow">She must have energy left over.</font>

703
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,610
<font color="yellow">How can she see two men at once?</font>

704
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,810
<font color="yellow">She's incredible.</font>

705
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,310
<font color="yellow">(Dongsan District Office)</font>

706
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you going home so late? Everybody else left.</font>

707
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,140
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

708
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,570
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

709
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,540
<font color="yellow">Are you always this slow?</font>

710
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,510
<font color="yellow">I don't like women who are slow.</font>

711
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,870
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

712
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,110
<font color="yellow">I waited for you because I had no options left.</font>

713
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,110
<font color="yellow">I gave you enough chances. You should notice by now.</font>

714
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,870
<font color="yellow">Are you clueless or what?</font>

715
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,140
<font color="yellow">- I can't wait for you any longer. - For what?</font>

716
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,010
<font color="yellow">- Why aren't you proposing to me? - Sorry?</font>

717
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,770
<font color="yellow">I would love to do it,</font>

718
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,940
<font color="yellow">but it looks like you did too so I waited.</font>

719
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,710
<font color="yellow">I took care of all the other women.</font>

720
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,140
<font color="yellow">I erased all their numbers and stopped flirting with girls.</font>

721
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,610
<font color="yellow">I had over 300 girls on my phone, and I erased them all.</font>

722
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,980
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that this man before you...</font>

723
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,110
<font color="yellow">is an incredible one.</font>

724
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

725
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,270
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - Tell her.</font>

726
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,810
<font color="yellow">I don't like women who cry or don't pay for jjajangmyeon.</font>

727
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,540
<font color="yellow">You always cry.</font>

728
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,070
<font color="yellow">The food's getting cold.</font>

729
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
<font color="yellow">What's going on with him?</font>

730
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,240
<font color="yellow">He told me to propose to him.</font>

731
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,810
<font color="yellow">He's out of his mind.</font>

732
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,440
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have listened to him. Just cut him off.</font>

733
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,240
<font color="yellow">He lives in the community.</font>

734
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,310
<font color="yellow">That doesn't mean you should listen to everything they say.</font>

735
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,040
<font color="yellow">You're too hardworking.</font>

736
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

737
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,140
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

738
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,270
<font color="yellow">I'll deal with him.</font>

739
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,240
<font color="yellow">We haven't spent time together recently.</font>

740
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,410
<font color="yellow">Our family's been going through a lot, so we didn't get to drink.</font>

741
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,610
<font color="yellow">I should have cared more, but I was too busy.</font>

742
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,340
<font color="yellow">I heard you found Jae Soon.</font>

743
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,940
<font color="yellow">I feel better now.</font>

744
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,240
<font color="yellow">It's nothing big.</font>

745
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,040
<font color="yellow">- It's about your mum. - Okay.</font>

746
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,770
<font color="yellow">She worked hard all her life.</font>

747
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,440
<font color="yellow">She must have been lonely.</font>

748
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,640
<font color="yellow">It's true. It probably bothers her every night.</font>

749
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,010
<font color="yellow">You must know about it, and you have your own family now.</font>

750
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,470
<font color="yellow">I can be honest, right?</font>

751
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,510
<font color="yellow">Of course. He must know.</font>

752
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,570
<font color="yellow">Your mum should have this in her mind.</font>

753
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,640
<font color="yellow">She probably couldn't date anybody because of you.</font>

754
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,470
<font color="yellow">Don't look at her just as your mum...</font>

755
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,970
<font color="yellow">but a person. She's a woman.</font>

756
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,740
<font color="yellow">I don't know about others but my mum is not like that.</font>

757
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,970
<font color="yellow">That's because you only look at her as your mum.</font>

758
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,870
<font color="yellow">Everybody's like that.</font>

759
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,570
<font color="yellow">After my father passed away, she hasn't thought about seeing anyone.</font>

760
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,340
<font color="yellow">She only cares about her children,</font>

761
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,770
<font color="yellow">and I'm proud of her. I respect her.</font>

762
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,110
<font color="yellow">You must be proud and respect her.</font>

763
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,870
<font color="yellow">But do you think that's happiness to her?</font>

764
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,410
<font color="yellow">She struggled enough. It's time for her to live for herself.</font>

765
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,640
<font color="yellow">You should let her see that man.</font>

766
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,910
<font color="yellow">I don't think she's seeing him any more.</font>

767
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,270
<font color="yellow">That's not what I heard.</font>

768
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,610
<font color="yellow">She's still seeing him.</font>

769
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,540
<font color="yellow">Her daughter came to confront her about it,</font>

770
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,010
<font color="yellow">and Gab Soon had to kick her out.</font>

771
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,140
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - You should take your mum's side...</font>

772
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,640
<font color="yellow">and make her feel at ease.</font>

773
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,610
<font color="yellow">If they say something rude to her,</font>

774
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,840
<font color="yellow">you should defend her.</font>

775
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,210
<font color="yellow">That's what children are supposed to do.</font>

776
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

777
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,840
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

778
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,410
<font color="yellow">Are you still seeing that old man?</font>

779
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? It's her life.</font>

780
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,510
<font color="yellow">Let her take care of it.</font>

781
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,910
<font color="yellow">I told you enough times.</font>

782
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,640
<font color="yellow">Were you seeing him discreetly?</font>

783
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,610
<font color="yellow">You promised me you won't see him again.</font>

784
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,370
<font color="yellow">And what?</font>

785
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:22,970
<font color="yellow">What are you really thinking?</font>

786
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,310
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? She can date whomever she wants.</font>

787
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,710
<font color="yellow">My mum's different.</font>

788
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,840
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

789
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,810
<font color="yellow">You can do whatever you want.</font>

790
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,140
<font color="yellow">If you like him so much, leave!</font>

791
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,710
<font color="yellow">I won't care any more. Do whatever you want.</font>

792
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,370
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

793
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,140
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

794
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,070
<font color="yellow">How can you tell your family?</font>

795
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,070
<font color="yellow">You said I talk too much,</font>

796
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,740
<font color="yellow">but this is different.</font>

797
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,510
<font color="yellow">Your dad invited me over. He totally embarrassed me.</font>

798
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,910
<font color="yellow">It's not like my mum is desperate for men.</font>

799
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,370
<font color="yellow">It was like I was standing naked in front of them.</font>

800
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,970
<font color="yellow">Why does your family care whom my mum sees?</font>

801
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,710
<font color="yellow">Why do they care?</font>

802
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,240
<font color="yellow">It's for your mum.</font>

803
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,070
<font color="yellow">You're not letting her date anybody.</font>

804
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,710
<font color="yellow">What? Date?</font>

805
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,770
<font color="yellow">Why would she date?</font>

806
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,010
<font color="yellow">You should accept it. She's a woman too.</font>

807
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,010
<font color="yellow">Is it because you don't want to live with her?</font>

808
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,010
<font color="yellow">You want an old man to take her away?</font>

809
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,840
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

810
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,640
<font color="yellow">It's not like he's poor.</font>

811
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,470
<font color="yellow">He's rich, so we can benefit too. What's wrong with that?</font>

812
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,570
<font color="yellow">She can date and eventually marry him.</font>

813
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,140
<font color="yellow">I don't want her to!</font>

814
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,910

<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

898
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,140

900

<font color="yellow">She's not the reason why we got separated.</font>

905
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,070
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

906
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,010
<font color="yellow">I don't care what people say about me,</font>

907
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,940
<font color="yellow">but that is where she works.</font>

908
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,340
<font color="yellow">She has a social life.</font>

909
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,710
<font color="yellow">You can't ruin her like that.</font>

910
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,840
<font color="yellow">What would the patients think?</font>

911
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,910
<font color="yellow">How can she face her fellow doctors and nurses?</font>

912
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:04,610
<font color="yellow">You didn't just insult her dignity. You ruined it for good.</font>

<font color="yellow">You still say she is not the reason,</font>

914
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,940
<font color="yellow">but you've just made it clear that she is.</font>

915
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,910
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo. When someone tells you something...</font>

916
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,940
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

917
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,840
<font color="yellow">I'm right in front of you, but you only worry about her.</font>

918
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,540
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed in you.</font>

919
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,010
<font color="yellow">If you do something like this again,</font>

920
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,970
<font color="yellow">I won't stand it.</font>

921
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:32,570
<font color="yellow">Se Gye.</font>

922
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,010
<font color="yellow">I just got off work. I'm on my way home now.</font>

923
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:51,970
<font color="yellow">What about the babies?</font>

924
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,810
<font color="yellow">I worked late today, so I told the nanny to put them to sleep.</font>

925
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,540
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry, and I miss you.</font>

926
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,640
<font color="yellow">Give me a minute. I have a solution for both.</font>

927
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,810
<font color="yellow">- The problem hasn't been solved. - What problem?</font>

928
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,910
<font color="yellow">I'm not hungry any more, but I still miss you.</font>

929
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,370
<font color="yellow">Here. Look all you want.</font>

930
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,440
<font color="yellow">This won't solve it.</font>

931
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,040
<font color="yellow">I'm looking at you, but I still miss you.</font>

932
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,240
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

933
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,440
<font color="yellow">Should I leave my face with you?</font>

934
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,870
<font color="yellow">Do you like me that much?</font>

935
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,470
<font color="yellow">How arrogant. I was nice to you, and you got all smug.</font>

936
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,640
<font color="yellow">When I'm with you, I feel guilty these days.</font>

937
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,240
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I can do this...</font>

938
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,740
<font color="yellow">or if I'm doing the right thing.</font>

939
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,910
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

940
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,410
<font color="yellow">I want to be with you until the end although I don't know...</font>

941
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,640
<font color="yellow">what is waiting for us there.</font>

942
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,310
<font color="yellow">Promise me one thing.</font>

943
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,240
<font color="yellow">If you meet a woman you want to marry,</font>

944
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,010
<font color="yellow">leave me.</font>

945
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,510
<font color="yellow">Leave and don't look back.</font>

946
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,970
<font color="yellow">Promise me that.</font>

947
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,210
<font color="yellow">I will stay by your side...</font>

948
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,140
<font color="yellow">only until then.</font>

949
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,640
<font color="yellow">Why are you home so late?</font>

950
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,310
<font color="yellow">You didn't pick up your phone.</font>

951
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,140
<font color="yellow">You said you'd only have dinner.</font>

952
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:04,310
<font color="yellow">Why do you care so much?</font>

953
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,740
<font color="yellow">We agreed not to do that.</font>

954
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,440
<font color="yellow">We said each of us would live the way we like.</font>

955
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:17,810
<font color="yellow">Did you forget that?</font>

956
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:22,110
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I even smell some bad cologne on you.</font>

957
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,370
<font color="yellow">What have you been doing?</font>

958
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,170
<font color="yellow">We had pork belly meat and soju,</font>

959
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,210
<font color="yellow">and went to a karaoke.</font>

960
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,370
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

961
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,770
<font color="yellow">We sang and danced.</font>

962
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:38,210
<font color="yellow">Everyone was so excited to have an elementary school reunion.</font>

963
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,710
<font color="yellow">How many people came?</font>

964
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,540
<font color="yellow">There were five girls and me.</font>

965
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,270
<font color="yellow">You must've been popular.</font>

966
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,470
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

967
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:52,210
<font color="yellow">It was amazing</font>

968
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,770
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

969
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,240
<font color="yellow">Dear me.</font>

970
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,940
<font color="yellow">You do all kinds of things now.</font>

971
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,940
<font color="yellow">The girls haven't changed at all.</font>

972
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,070
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, girls? They're all old now.</font>

973
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,470
<font color="yellow">How could they not change?</font>

974
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,170
<font color="yellow">They must be all old with wrinkles.</font>

975
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,540
<font color="yellow">No, they're not.</font>

976
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,540
<font color="yellow">They're just like before when they were young.</font>

977
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:16,740
<font color="yellow">It was so amazing</font>

978
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,710
<font color="yellow">He's totally excited.</font>

979
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:30,070
<font color="yellow">If you're going to disapprove, you must do it until the very end.</font>

980
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,370
<font color="yellow">If you don't firmly disapprove and have them get married,</font>

981
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,270
<font color="yellow">you'll both end up getting hurt.</font>

982
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,510
<font color="yellow">You weren't sleeping?</font>

983
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,340
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

984
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,470
<font color="yellow">Have a seat for a while. Everyone's sleeping.</font>

985
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,840
<font color="yellow">Why drink in the middle of the night?</font>

986
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,110
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo,</font>

987
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:17,370
<font color="yellow">this is wrong.</font>

988
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:21,770
<font color="yellow">I don't care if the girl is old without much education.</font>

989
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,070
<font color="yellow">It's okay even if she's an orphan. However,</font>

990
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,810
<font color="yellow">having kids is a different story.</font>

991
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,570
<font color="yellow">You raised me too.</font>

992
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,170
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm disapproving of her.</font>

993
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:32,310
<font color="yellow">I'll live happily.</font>

994
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,040
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I'm confident enough to be their dad. It's true.</font>

995
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:39,270
<font color="yellow">You're not afraid of anything now because you're blinded by love,</font>

996
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,270
<font color="yellow">but there's nothing more cunning than people's feelings.</font>

997
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,610
<font color="yellow">How long will that love last?</font>

998
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,840
<font color="yellow">What will you do when you become sick of her?</font>

999
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,970
<font color="yellow">Will you abandon them?</font>

1000
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:49,970
<font color="yellow">That will never happen.</font>

1001
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,810
<font color="yellow">You can't help it when your feelings change.</font>

1002
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,410
<font color="yellow">The babies will be hurt too.</font>

1003
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,040
<font color="yellow">Raising others' kids...</font>

1004
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,310
<font color="yellow">isn't something anyone can do.</font>

1005
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,140
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

1006
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:04,340
<font color="yellow">I respect those who raise others' kids more than anyone else.</font>

1007
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,770
<font color="yellow">I don't care. I'm not going to see you do that.</font>

1008
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,210
<font color="yellow">This isn't why I raised you all this time.</font>

1009
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:11,310
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

1010
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,410
<font color="yellow">I couldn't fall asleep, so we had a talk.</font>

1011
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:18,210
<font color="yellow">Let's go upstairs. I'm sleepy now.</font>

1012
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,340
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

1013
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:45,610
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

1014
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,240
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1015
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,440
<font color="yellow">She died?</font>

1016
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:54,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it tastes really bad.</font>

1017
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,640
<font color="yellow">I can't do this any more.</font>

1018
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,770
<font color="yellow">Oh my. It's Mr Jo.</font>

1019
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,810
<font color="yellow">Should I call him Geum Sik instead?</font>

1020
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,270
<font color="yellow">How should I call him now?</font>

1021
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:12,710
<font color="yellow">Hello, Geum Sik. What brings you here?</font>

1022
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:13,940
<font color="yellow">Come have a seat.</font>

1023
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:15,810
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1024
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,910
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go to work?</font>

1025
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:29,070
<font color="yellow">I guess he came in the middle of his shift.</font>

1026
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,470
<font color="yellow">Have some.</font>

1027
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,940
<font color="yellow">I think he's funny.</font>

1028
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,140
<font color="yellow">It's my first time seeing him. He's hilarious.</font>

1029
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,810
<font color="yellow">He's very popular these days.</font>

1030
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,470
<font color="yellow">You're all really mean.</font>

1031
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,310
<font color="yellow">You don't even know what happened to Jae Soon,</font>

1032
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,470
<font color="yellow">but you're all laughing.</font>

1033
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:56,440
<font color="yellow">Do you know where I've been?</font>

1034
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:58,870
<font color="yellow">I went to the morgue at a hospital.</font>

1035
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:01,310
<font color="yellow">I went there to check the dead body.</font>

1036
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,870
<font color="yellow">I was relieved that it wasn't her,</font>

1037
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,010
<font color="yellow">but my heart raced, and my legs shook.</font>

1038
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,010
<font color="yellow">What if she gives up on her life from struggling so much?</font>

1039
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,640
<font color="yellow">How could you be so calm?</font>

1040
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,070
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd be like this.</font>

1041
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,170
<font color="yellow">I'll find poor Jae Soon myself.</font>

1042
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,910
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

1043
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:30,970
<font color="yellow">I thought he'd given up looking for her after several days.</font>

1044
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,810
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

1045
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:40,440
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik, Geum Sik.</font>

1046
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,810
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you any more.</font>

1047
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:42,810
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik.</font>

1048
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,170
<font color="yellow">I'm really disappointed in you.</font>

1049
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:47,570
<font color="yellow">It may be possible for others, but you can't do this.</font>

1050
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:50,240
<font color="yellow">How could you be so happy right now?</font>

1051
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:51,810
<font color="yellow">We found her.</font>

1052
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,610
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

1053
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,370
<font color="yellow">We found Jae Soon.</font>

1054
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,840
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

1055
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:03,270
<font color="yellow">When? Where is she? Is she alive?</font>

1056
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,440
<font color="yellow">She is alive.</font>

1057
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:06,340
<font color="yellow">Where? Where is she?</font>

1058
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,310
<font color="yellow">In Incheon.</font>

1059
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,070
<font color="yellow">With Ddol Ee?</font>

1060
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:11,910
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1061
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

1062
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,140
<font color="yellow">You should've at least told me.</font>

1063
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,270
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed.</font>

1064
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,170
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you before anyone else.</font>
