00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,108
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

4
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:30,738
<font color="yellow">There's no one here. Let's eat together.</font>

5
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:34,008
<font color="yellow">What if somebody comes?</font>

6
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:35,708
<font color="yellow">Nobody will come.</font>

7
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,208
<font color="yellow">Listen to me while you work in this house.</font>

8
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:39,978
<font color="yellow">Get yourself a bowl of rice and sit down.</font>

9
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,338
<font color="yellow">Eat.</font>

10
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,538
<font color="yellow">Nobody has ever boned a fish for me.</font>

11
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:08,008
<font color="yellow">It's your first time?</font>

12
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,868
<font color="yellow">Your husband never did this for you?</font>

13
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:11,208
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

14
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,868
<font color="yellow">My dad boned fish for me.</font>

15
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,138
<font color="yellow">He raised me as a precious child.</font>

16
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:20,108
<font color="yellow">But I guess I'm just unfortunate.</font>

17
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:23,008
<font color="yellow">My husband was neither considerate nor was he a man of heart.</font>

18
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:26,468
<font color="yellow">From now on, do everything with me if it's your first time.</font>

19
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:31,708

00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,938
<font color="yellow">When... When did you come home?</font>

22
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,268
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam, what are you doing?</font>

23
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,738
<font color="yellow">Why are you having a meal together with my dad?</font>

24
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,338
<font color="yellow">When did you sit there?</font>

25
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:56,238
<font color="yellow">I told you to bone my fish, not sit.</font>

26
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,268
<font color="yellow">- From now on, be careful. - See?</font>

27
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:02,108
<font color="yellow">You were too easy on her. That's why she sat to eat with you.</font>

28
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:03,568
<font color="yellow">Be careful from now on.</font>

29
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:05,668
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

30
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:07,268
<font color="yellow">Say, "Ma'am".</font>

31
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:11,738
<font color="yellow">I will, Ma'am.</font>

32
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:13,308
<font color="yellow">What a sight, really.</font>

33
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,308
<font color="yellow">Bring a glass of juice to my room.</font>

34

35
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:24,338
<font color="yellow">"When did you sit there?"</font>

36
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:26,638
<font color="yellow">I only sat down because you begged me to.</font>

37
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:29,468
<font color="yellow">Who would have known that she'd come right at that moment?</font>

38
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,108
<font color="yellow">I'll teach her a lesson.</font>

39
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:32,338
<font color="yellow">Forget it!</font>

54
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:48,508
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

55
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:52,938

<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

58
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,708
<font color="yellow">Finally, someone wants my service. He wants me to clean tomorrow.</font>

00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:04,668
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

60
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:06,108
<font color="yellow">Everyone, go back to sleep.</font>

61
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:10,168
<font color="yellow">I thought you passed to be a teacher.</font>

62
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,968
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee almost woke up.</font>

63
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:14,808
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

64
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,238
<font color="yellow">- It's clean. - Thank you.</font>

65
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,468
<font color="yellow">In case there's something you're not satisfied with,</font>

66
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:52,878
<font color="yellow">contact me within three days. I'll provide a follow-up service.</font>

67
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:54,168
<font color="yellow">Here's your coupon.</font>

68
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,708
<font color="yellow">If you use our cleaning service 10 times, the next one is free.</font>

69
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:00,838
<font color="yellow">I'd really appreciate it if you spread the word.</font>

70
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:06,338
<font color="yellow">It's my first income. I'd better post it on the wall.</font>

71
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:07,468
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

72
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:10,338
<font color="yellow">Of course. When he texted me last night,</font>

73
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:13,068
<font color="yellow">it felt like the door to paradise was opening.</font>

74
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:15,378
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I vented at you.</font>

75
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:17,268
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with your venting any time.</font>

76
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:20,508
<font color="yellow">You said that to help me, but I was all twisted.</font>

77
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,878
<font color="yellow">Now, I'll save money, get an office and buy a car.</font>

78
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,538
<font color="yellow">I could teach you how to drive.</font>

79
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:26,668
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

80
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:28,908
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

81
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:30,938
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon.</font>

82
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:33,108
<font color="yellow">Right, I totally forgot.</font>

83
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:39,568
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

84
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,838
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

85
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,568
<font color="yellow">If you ask for her service once a week, I'll buy you a nice meal.</font>

86
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:47,108
<font color="yellow">You liked her service, right?</font>

87
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,238
<font color="yellow">I told you she's good.</font>

88
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:53,668
<font color="yellow">I better hang up now. Bye.</font>

89
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:56,268
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

90
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:01,368
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

91
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,338
<font color="yellow">I'm going to Sokcho.</font>

92
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:11,468
<font color="yellow">I'll leave you with the kids and go relax.</font>

93
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:16,538
<font color="yellow">How could none of our kids not know about how we feel?</font>

94
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:21,738
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon was always stubborn, so she did as she pleased.</font>

95
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:25,008
<font color="yellow">However, Jae Soon never defied me.</font>

96
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,838
<font color="yellow">All of a sudden, she looked straight at me...</font>

97
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:30,508
<font color="yellow">and said all the things to defy me.</font>

98
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,108
<font color="yellow">It feels like I got my back, front and side stabbed.</font>

99
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:37,238
<font color="yellow">I really want to resign from parenting.</font>

100
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,638
<font color="yellow">I don't know where to set my mind.</font>

101
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:44,708
<font color="yellow">Don't try to find a spot to set your mind. Just take care of yourself.</font>

102
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,238
<font color="yellow">Leave your kids alone.</font>

103
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:50,868
<font color="yellow">No kid follows their parents' wish.</font>

104
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:53,168
<font color="yellow">We all used to be like that as kids, too.</font>

105
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,008
<font color="yellow">- Are you leaving now? - There's someone I have to see.</font>

106
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:00,738
<font color="yellow">I'll be back next week.</font>

107
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,738
<font color="yellow">Let's go to court then.</font>

108
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:16,838
<font color="yellow">Dad, can't you go to Sokcho tomorrow?</font>

109
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:19,968
<font color="yellow">I called everyone over. Have dinner with us.</font>

110
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:22,438
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

111
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,608
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why aren't you coming?</font>

112
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,138
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

113
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:33,838
<font color="yellow">Is it someone's birthday?</font>

114
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:36,138
<font color="yellow">It's no one in the family.</font>

115
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:38,838
<font color="yellow">- I'm getting married. - Forget it.</font>

116
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,138
<font color="yellow">Today's Mum and Dad's wedding anniversary.</font>

117
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,938
<font color="yellow">Why bother remembering a day like this? It's bothersome.</font>

118
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,408
<font color="yellow">It's not bothersome.</font>

119
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:51,138
<font color="yellow">We all exist because you two got married, so it's a precious day.</font>

120
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:52,608
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

121
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:56,208
<font color="yellow">They went through thick and thin, but you were born thanks to them.</font>

122
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,668
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, you wouldn't have seen the world.</font>

123
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:01,768
<font color="yellow">I also forgot about it, but I knew because Jae Soon called.</font>

124
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,708
<font color="yellow">She's s good at remembering these things including our birthdays.</font>

125
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:07,108
<font color="yellow">She didn't even perform well at school.</font>

126
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,308
<font color="yellow">She remembers all the useless stuff.</font>

127
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:12,508
<font color="yellow">She wasn't all that bad. She was just average.</font>

128
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,508
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Jae Soon, I remembered my wedding anniversary every year...</font>

129
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,108
<font color="yellow">since she was in elementary school.</font>

130
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:19,968
<font color="yellow">I never got a single card from my husband,</font>

131
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:23,408
<font color="yellow">but she gave me cards congratulating my wedding anniversary...</font>

132
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,408
<font color="yellow">for 30 years.</font>

133
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,468
<font color="yellow">Blow the candle together.</font>

134
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:30,438
<font color="yellow">Blow.</font>

135
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:37,978
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations, congratulations - Congratulations, congratulations</font>

136
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:41,438
<font color="yellow">- Happy wedding anniversary - Happy wedding anniversary</font>

137
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,568
<font color="yellow">It isn't something grand enough to congratulate.</font>

138
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,038
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

139
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:50,908
<font color="yellow">There are many parents who keep talking about getting a divorce,</font>

140
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:54,068
<font color="yellow">but you two have always been great with each other.</font>

141
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,708
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

142
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,338
<font color="yellow">Same here. Thank you, Mum and Dad.</font>

143
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:02,478
<font color="yellow">My friend's parents got divorced when she was in high school.</font>

144
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,008
<font color="yellow">She struggled a lot. She even ran away from home.</font>

145
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,768
<font color="yellow">That's better than getting divorced later on.</font>

146
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:10,838
<font color="yellow">There are many silly people who get divorced when they're old.</font>

147
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:12,508
<font color="yellow">- Why is that silly? - Why is that silly?</font>

148
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,168
<font color="yellow">You two always come at me together these days.</font>

149
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:18,568
<font color="yellow">How sad that I don't have a husband.</font>

150
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,308
<font color="yellow">I've been through it all.</font>

151
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:24,768
<font color="yellow">I'm living proof. It's true.</font>

152
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:30,108
<font color="yellow">Even if you're old, you can still get divorced.</font>

153
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:34,238
<font color="yellow">If living with your spouse is too hard, you'd be better off alone.</font>

154
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:42,008
<font color="yellow">I think Mum and Dad don't fight as much as other parents.</font>

155
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:43,308
<font color="yellow">- You're right. - That's right.</font>

156
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:44,608
<font color="yellow">They do fight.</font>

157
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:47,808
<font color="yellow">After your dad retired, your mum always...</font>

158
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,368
<font color="yellow">nags him and yells at him.</font>

159
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,568
<font color="yellow">I have a present for you.</font>

160
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,338
<font color="yellow">Surprise! It's matching t-shirts for you guys.</font>

161
00:09:56,568 --> 00:10:00,138
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Hey. Let me see that.</font>

162
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:02,308
<font color="yellow">If he wears this,</font>

163
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:06,208
<font color="yellow">he'll look 10 years younger.</font>

164
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:09,408
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim. Why don't you hold it up to yourself?</font>

165
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:11,708
<font color="yellow">Mum. What do you think?</font>

166
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,338
<font color="yellow">- It looks good on you. - It's pretty. Yours, too, Dad.</font>

167
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:17,268
<font color="yellow">You look like a happy couple.</font>

168
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,638
<font color="yellow">Stop it. It's tacky.</font>

169
00:10:19,738 --> 00:10:22,638
<font color="yellow">I don't like people wearing matching clothes.</font>

170
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,708
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to wear it, forget it.</font>

171
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,338
<font color="yellow">- Hey. How do I look? - Yes?</font>

172
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:30,138
<font color="yellow">I always follow your dad around,</font>

173
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:32,838
<font color="yellow">so I should wear it instead.</font>

174
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:35,408
<font color="yellow">Gosh. It's Mum's.</font>

175
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,768
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

176
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,838
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

177
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:44,478
<font color="yellow">We bought this together. We thought you'd enjoy a trip to a hot spring.</font>

178
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,068
<font color="yellow">They're tickets for a trip to a hot spring.</font>

179
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:49,868
<font color="yellow">You can wear those matching t-shirts.</font>

180
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:53,508
<font color="yellow">A trip may be too much. I'd prefer cash.</font>

181
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:57,608
<font color="yellow">I don't need all that. I don't want to go on a trip with him.</font>

182
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,068
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

183
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:02,468
<font color="yellow">She must be drunk.</font>

184
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,468
<font color="yellow">When did you drink so much?</font>

185
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,708
<font color="yellow">She's been sipping on that for a while now.</font>

186
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,668
<font color="yellow">I don't need any of you.</font>

187
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:13,338
<font color="yellow">I've been holding myself back for you. Is this all I get?</font>

188
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:17,338
<font color="yellow">- Go in. You're drunk. - Let go of me. I'm not drunk.</font>

189
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:19,868
<font color="yellow">I'm just so upset and angry.</font>

190
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,138
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

191
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,738
<font color="yellow">- I don't need any of you. - Stop. This is a happy occasion.</font>

192
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:27,538
<font color="yellow">Happy occasion, my foot.</font>

193
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:31,938
<font color="yellow">Tell me. What on earth did I do wrong?</font>

194
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,838
<font color="yellow">I just wanted you to succeed. Do you hate it that much?</font>

195
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:37,068
<font color="yellow">You told me not to care about you.</font>

196
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:40,738
<font color="yellow">You told me to live my life and not cling onto you.</font>

197
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:43,938
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - Listen, Shin Joong Nyeon.</font>

198
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,568
<font color="yellow">- Mum. - Mum.</font>

199
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:46,738
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

200
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:48,938
<font color="yellow">I don't need you all. Just go.</font>

201
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:52,038
<font color="yellow">This is my house. I don't want any of you to come.</font>

202
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,668
<font color="yellow">I'll live by myself. You should all just go.</font>

203
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:58,208
<font color="yellow">Why on earth should I give you 50 percent of it?</font>

204
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,708
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim. Let's go in.</font>

205
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,438
<font color="yellow">Don't. I'll do it.</font>

206
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,608
<font color="yellow">Don't mind us. You can go if you want to.</font>

207
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,608
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

208
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,408
<font color="yellow">We had an anniversary party when we're divorced.</font>

209
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,068
<font color="yellow">Are you happy now?</font>

210
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:34,268
<font color="yellow">It'd be great if we go to a hot spring in those matching t-shirts.</font>

211
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,568
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

212
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,638
<font color="yellow">- Keep your voice down. - Shin Joong Nyeon.</font>

213
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:00,568
<font color="yellow">You can tell me now.</font>

214
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:04,708
<font color="yellow">What on earth did I do wrong?</font>

215
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,708
<font color="yellow">Is this what I get after...</font>

216
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,238
<font color="yellow">taking care of all of you for 40 years?</font>

217
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:14,238
<font color="yellow">I've always fed you even if I had to starve.</font>

218
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:20,038
<font color="yellow">All I have now is this broken body.</font>

219
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,838
<font color="yellow">Why are you all doing this to me?</font>

220
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,368
<font color="yellow">Don't you need me any more?</font>

221
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:31,008
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even say anything when I was sick because you'd worry.</font>

222
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,668
<font color="yellow">I'm not made of iron.</font>

223
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:38,338
<font color="yellow">I get sick, too.</font>

224
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:42,038
<font color="yellow">I'm left with nothing.</font>

225
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:47,138
<font color="yellow">I feel so empty and so dejected.</font>

226
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:51,468
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

227
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,138
<font color="yellow">Did they go home?</font>

228
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:25,168
<font color="yellow">After Nae Shim got so upset,</font>

229
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:27,938
<font color="yellow">they went out to have a drink by themselves.</font>

230
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:31,708
<font color="yellow">They didn't hear her cry. Don't worry.</font>

231
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:33,468
<font color="yellow">I made them leave right away.</font>

232
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:36,238
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep. We should go back to Sokcho tomorrow.</font>

233
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:37,908
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

234
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:40,108
<font color="yellow">You divorced her, didn't you?</font>

235
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:48,908
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Mum?</font>

236
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,808
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

237
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:53,038
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

238
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,508
<font color="yellow">Maybe she didn't like our present.</font>

239
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:57,468
<font color="yellow">We should've given them cash.</font>

240
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:59,308
<font color="yellow">Mum likes money.</font>

241
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,438
<font color="yellow">Maybe Mum and Dad had a fight.</font>

242
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:05,438
<font color="yellow">I hardly stay home these days, so I don't know what's going on.</font>

243
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:07,568
<font color="yellow">I didn't see them fight.</font>

244
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:10,468
<font color="yellow">I've never seen Mum so angry.</font>

245
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,168
<font color="yellow">I guess you haven't seen it,</font>

246
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,338
<font color="yellow">but we've seen it a few times.</font>

247
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,708
<font color="yellow">Mum is acting strange these days.</font>

248
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,068
<font color="yellow">It's because of me.</font>

249
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:20,838
<font color="yellow">I upset her, too.</font>

250
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,568
<font color="yellow">I guess it's because of us.</font>

251
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:35,368
<font color="yellow">Mum. You seemed drunk last night. Are you okay?</font>

252
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,768
<font color="yellow">I made bean sprouts soup. Do you want to eat it now?</font>

253
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:39,268
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

254
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:41,438
<font color="yellow">Dad went to Sokcho with Aunt this morning.</font>

255
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,738
<font color="yellow">I'm not getting enough customers as it is.</font>

256
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,338
<font color="yellow">Did you have to come today?</font>

257
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,768
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

258
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:58,368
<font color="yellow">Your business is going badly, but we come and try to find faults.</font>

259
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,668
<font color="yellow">It's terrible, isn't it?</font>

260
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:03,538
<font color="yellow">I'll come in this Sunday and help you clean.</font>

261
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,438
<font color="yellow">Actually, I can't. I have a blind date that day. I'm sorry.</font>

262
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:11,038
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're so sly.</font>

263
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:13,038
<font color="yellow">I called a cleaning company already.</font>

264
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,968
<font color="yellow">We don't want to do this,</font>

265
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:18,008
<font color="yellow">but it's directly connected to people's health. We have no choice.</font>

266
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:19,808
<font color="yellow">There she is.</font>

267
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:22,268
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm here to clean.</font>

268
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:23,938
<font color="yellow">Are you here to clean?</font>

269
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,808
<font color="yellow">You must do a thorough job.</font>

270
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:28,068
<font color="yellow">You should satisfy her.</font>

271
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,468
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

272
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:33,708
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Ma'am. I hope your business goes well.</font>

273
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:36,808
<font color="yellow">You two look good together. Is he a new employee?</font>

274
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:38,938
<font color="yellow">Why bother going on blind dates?</font>

275
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:42,768
<font color="yellow">If you say so, I'll think about it.</font>

276
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,208
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

277
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,308
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Have a good day.</font>

278
00:16:58,038 --> 00:16:59,968
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. Where should I start?</font>

279
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,538
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol. Can I talk to you for a minute?</font>

280
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,568
<font color="yellow">All of our friends are saying bad things about you.</font>

281
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,108
<font color="yellow">You know that, right?</font>

282
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,868
<font color="yellow">Are you going to leave Gab Soon like that?</font>

283
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:18,968
<font color="yellow">You're a man. You should take care of her.</font>

284
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,768
<font color="yellow">I know your mum doesn't like her,</font>

285
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,678
<font color="yellow">but be a man about it.</font>

286
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:27,138
<font color="yellow">You said you'd marry Gab Soon once you become a public official.</font>

287
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:29,308
<font color="yellow">We're all witnesses.</font>

288
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:31,908
<font color="yellow">Did you change your mind?</font>

289
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:34,368
<font color="yellow">It's not that. You know it.</font>

290
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,438
<font color="yellow">You're always with your female senior officer these days.</font>

291
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:40,568
<font color="yellow">- Are you two together? - We're not.</font>

292
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:42,838
<font color="yellow">I just work with her.</font>

293
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:46,868
<font color="yellow">You're with a public official. Gab Soon is with a rich playboy.</font>

294
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:50,068
<font color="yellow">What is this? This isn't what I wanted to see.</font>

295
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,068
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

296
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:54,178
<font color="yellow">Is she always with that guy?</font>

297
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:55,938
<font color="yellow">People think they're together.</font>

298
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:02,338
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon. Are you busy? Can I see you later?</font>

299
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:04,838
<font color="yellow">I'm busy today. I have a cleaning job at night.</font>

300
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,738
<font color="yellow">We can't keep doing this.</font>

301
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:08,868
<font color="yellow">Let's meet. I have something to say to you.</font>

302
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,138
<font color="yellow">You can't make personal calls during work hours.</font>

303

<font color="yellow">Maybe I'm too ignorant. I didn't understand what it meant.</font>

453
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,438
<font color="yellow">I guess someone like me wouldn't understand art.</font>

454
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:50,668
<font color="yellow">I've never been to an art museum.</font>

455
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:52,268
<font color="yellow">I had no time for that.</font>

456
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:53,838
<font color="yellow">I don't really get it, either.</font>

457
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:56,208
<font color="yellow">It's fine as long as it's good to look at.</font>

458
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,138
<font color="yellow">You don't have to interpret its meaning.</font>

459
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,808
<font color="yellow">Maybe you should've gone to a theatre.</font>

460
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:04,438
<font color="yellow">She's right. There are so many good movies these days.</font>

461
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:07,538
<font color="yellow">That place is no different. How can I go alone?</font>

462
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:09,308
<font color="yellow">Many people go alone.</font>

463
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,668
<font color="yellow">It would be nice to have Dad around.</font>

464
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,108
<font color="yellow">Dad's been in Sokcho for too long. Should I tell him to come?</font>

465
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,268
<font color="yellow">- Leave him be. - Leave it.</font>

466
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:19,438
<font color="yellow">He's already there. Why bother?</font>

467
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:21,308
<font color="yellow">Mum, let's go together next time.</font>

468
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:23,808
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, you should go back to cleaning.</font>

469
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:25,068
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

470
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:27,008
<font color="yellow">Don't do this again, Mum.</font>

471
00:29:27,568 --> 00:29:29,738
<font color="yellow">Tell us if you're going somewhere.</font>

472
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:31,608
<font color="yellow">You make me nervous these days.</font>

473
00:29:33,268 --> 00:29:35,368
<font color="yellow">- Have you eaten yet? - I'm not hungry.</font>

474
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:41,368
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

475
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:45,068
<font color="yellow">- No. - I'm going to sleep.</font>

476
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,638
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

477
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:55,838
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

478
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:00,968
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

479
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,608
<font color="yellow">Stop there!</font>

480
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:06,068
<font color="yellow">A Young, wait!</font>

481
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:09,238
<font color="yellow">I'll give it back. I will.</font>

482
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:10,538
<font color="yellow">You didn't use the money, right?</font>

483
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:13,268
<font color="yellow">- I haven't. Well, not much. - "Not much"?</font>

484
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:15,538
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

485
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:22,238
<font color="yellow">I kept it because it would be dangerous for you to have it.</font>

486
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:23,638
<font color="yellow">Don't misunderstand me.</font>

487
00:31:24,168 --> 00:31:25,208
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

488
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:40,368
<font color="yellow">- Where did it go? - You!</font>

489
00:31:41,138 --> 00:31:42,208
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

490
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,308
<font color="yellow">It was here a minute ago. I'm not lying.</font>

491
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,838
<font color="yellow">It was right here when I walked into the office.</font>

492
00:31:51,138 --> 00:31:52,138
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

493
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,868
<font color="yellow">What will we do?</font>

494
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:14,738
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

495
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:16,408
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

496
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:19,208
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, you're in charge of the special offer products.</font>

497
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:20,368
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

498
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:22,568
<font color="yellow">The special offer eggs over here are three dollars.</font>

499
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:24,568
<font color="yellow">The other products over there are over four dollars.</font>

500
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:26,308
<font color="yellow">You need to sell these in an hour.</font>

501
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,208
<font color="yellow">Could you tell me how?</font>

502
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:39,408
<font color="yellow">Buy some eggs.</font>

503
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:43,168
<font color="yellow">Eggs are on sale for three dollars.</font>

504
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:44,608
<font color="yellow">Buy some eggs.</font>

505
00:33:21,338 --> 00:33:22,838
<font color="yellow">Buy some eggs.</font>

506
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,838
<font color="yellow">Eggs are sale for three dollars.</font>

507
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,408
<font color="yellow">Buy some eggs.</font>

508
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:30,608
<font color="yellow">How could you not sell even one until now?</font>

509
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:34,168
<font color="yellow">You need to sell all of the special offer products in an hour.</font>

510
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,638
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

511
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,408
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

512
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:42,038
<font color="yellow">Everyone! Eggs are here!</font>

513
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:44,768
<font color="yellow">Come and see the delicious looking eggs.</font>

514
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:47,408
<font color="yellow">They're only 3 dollars. Only 3 dollars!</font>

515
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,538
<font color="yellow">Come and see the delicious looking eggs.</font>

516
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:52,138
<font color="yellow">- I'll take one. - Give it to her.</font>

517
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,608
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - I'll have two trays.</font>

518
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:54,838
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

519
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:56,638
<font color="yellow">- I'll take one. - Here it is.</font>

520
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:59,068
<font color="yellow">- I'll have that one. - Here.</font>

521
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:07,768
<font color="yellow">I can't eat.</font>

522
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:10,578
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about them.</font>

523
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:13,768
<font color="yellow">I don't even know where they moved.</font>

524
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:16,608
<font color="yellow">I'm worried sick.</font>

525
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,578
<font color="yellow">Just ask them like you always do.</font>

526
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,708
<font color="yellow">Ask them where they moved and if they've eaten.</font>

527
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:28,868
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

528
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:32,908
<font color="yellow">Geum Sik, it's me.</font>

529
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,138
<font color="yellow">What happened? I heard you moved.</font>

530
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,008
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

531
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:41,368
<font color="yellow">I didn't have the time, so I couldn't tell you.</font>

532
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:42,738
<font color="yellow">Where did you move to?</font>

533
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:48,138
<font color="yellow">You didn't move far because of the kids' school?</font>

534
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:52,408
<font color="yellow">Of course. Are the kids all right?</font>

535
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:54,608
<font color="yellow">What happened to the company?</font>

536
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:56,108
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

537
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:02,968
<font color="yellow">I guess he isn't doing so well. He hung up.</font>

538
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,408
<font color="yellow">Maybe he went bankrupt.</font>

539
00:35:06,508 --> 00:35:10,168
<font color="yellow">Let me give you a piece of advice. Mind your own business.</font>

540
00:35:11,438 --> 00:35:12,668
<font color="yellow">Don't call him again.</font>

541
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:28,738
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

542
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:31,938
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

543
00:35:33,238 --> 00:35:34,468
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

544
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:41,268
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? I thought you were taking a rest.</font>

545
00:35:41,468 --> 00:35:43,408
<font color="yellow">My client wants me. You should go to bed.</font>

546
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,268
<font color="yellow">Take care of your health.</font>

547
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:55,708
<font color="yellow">It's ready.</font>

548
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:57,338
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

549
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:59,838
<font color="yellow">Please call me again whenever you're out of water.</font>

550
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:01,608
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

551
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:09,108
<font color="yellow">It's important to set it at the right temperature.</font>

552
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:10,708
<font color="yellow">You'll know it by the sound.</font>

553
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:13,208
<font color="yellow">- A glass of beer, please. - Okay.</font>

554
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:14,708
<font color="yellow">I'll go get it for them.</font>

555
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:25,368
<font color="yellow">Geum Soo Jo.</font>

556
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,008
<font color="yellow">It's nice to see you here.</font>

557
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:31,838
<font color="yellow">- Are you in charge of this place? - Yes.</font>

558
00:36:32,008 --> 00:36:34,738
<font color="yellow">I'm taking over this place.</font>

559
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:37,578
<font color="yellow">- Are you starting a business? - Yes. Isn't it a great idea?</font>

560
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:39,468
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I'll do a good job?</font>

561
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:41,638
<font color="yellow">It's better than working at karaoke.</font>

562
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,168
<font color="yellow">Say hello when you stop by.</font>

563
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:46,638
<font color="yellow">- A bottle of soju, please. - Okay.</font>

564
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:50,668
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

565
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:52,408
<font color="yellow">I went to train for the job.</font>

566
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,078
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to fry chicken.</font>

567
00:36:55,268 --> 00:36:57,608
<font color="yellow">There isn't anything that can be done easily.</font>

568
00:36:58,078 --> 00:37:00,108
<font color="yellow">- Are you really going to do that? - I will.</font>

569
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:03,008
<font color="yellow">I'm going to earn money and bring the kids here.</font>

570
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,638
<font color="yellow">Dream on.</font>

571
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:07,238
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about others. Worry about yourself first.</font>

572
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:09,008
<font color="yellow">I've attracted investors.</font>

573
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:10,968
<font color="yellow">What kind of lunatic would invest in you?</font>

574
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:12,578
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

575
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:15,038
<font color="yellow">He must be filthy rich to waste money like that.</font>

576
00:37:15,368 --> 00:37:16,908
<font color="yellow">What does he see in you?</font>

577
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:22,078
<font color="yellow">You wait and see! I'll surprise you.</font>

578
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:24,808
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

579
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,708
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

580
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:31,108
<font color="yellow">I made some kimchi pancakes. You haven't eaten dinner yet.</font>

581
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,338
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you feel sorry...</font>

582
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:39,838
<font color="yellow">after making me worry all this time?</font>

583
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:41,438
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

584
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:46,908
<font color="yellow">- Where's Gab Soon? - She's at her cleaning job.</font>

585
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:54,668
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

586
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:57,138
<font color="yellow">I saw the papers.</font>

587
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,838
<font color="yellow">Your divorce papers.</font>

588
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:04,078
<font color="yellow">I found it in your drawers.</font>

589
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:05,938
<font color="yellow">Why did you look through my drawers?</font>

590
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:07,708
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to do that?</font>

591
00:38:08,468 --> 00:38:11,208
<font color="yellow">It's a shock that you and Dad are getting a divorce.</font>

592
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:16,008
<font color="yellow">I'm a divorcee myself, but I never imagined this.</font>

593
00:38:17,638 --> 00:38:19,368
<font color="yellow">Can I ask why?</font>

594
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:28,108
<font color="yellow">Did Dad do something wrong?</font>

595
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:33,138
<font color="yellow">Of course, only the two people involved would know.</font>

596
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:37,608
<font color="yellow">You must have had your reasons for wanting a divorce.</font>

597
00:38:38,468 --> 00:38:41,338
<font color="yellow">But there's no good in getting a divorce now.</font>

598
00:38:46,438 --> 00:38:49,408
<font color="yellow">Mum. Cancel it now when you can.</font>

599
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,078
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to live alone.</font>

600
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:56,268
<font color="yellow">I don't want people to see you as a divorcee.</font>

601
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:59,508
<font color="yellow">You must not know reality.</font>

602
00:39:00,108 --> 00:39:04,138
<font color="yellow">It's amazing that you're with the man you married for the first time.</font>

603
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:07,168
<font color="yellow">You came this far already.</font>

604
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:10,408
<font color="yellow">That's only what you kids think.</font>

605
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:13,368
<font color="yellow">My friends' parents also got a divorce at an old age.</font>

606
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:15,408
<font color="yellow">The kids are having a hard time.</font>

607
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:17,468
<font color="yellow">They only meet on family events.</font>

608
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:19,768
<font color="yellow">Others call them a "family event couple".</font>

609
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:24,078
<font color="yellow">The kids are also living all apart. They don't even meet often.</font>

610
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:26,468
<font color="yellow">They make two trips to see each parent.</font>

611
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,038
<font color="yellow">They feel like they're not a family any more.</font>

612
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:32,508
<font color="yellow">Parents are the ones who hold the family together.</font>

613
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,408
<font color="yellow">I don't want our family living like that.</font>

614
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:38,608
<font color="yellow">You're all being selfish.</font>

615
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,008
<font color="yellow">Look. Even until now, you're trying to...</font>

616
00:39:42,138 --> 00:39:45,038
<font color="yellow">stop us from living our lives just for your own sake.</font>

617
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,808
<font color="yellow">It's not because of that.</font>

618
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:49,868
<font color="yellow">What good will come of getting a divorce now?</font>

619
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:52,808
<font color="yellow">Dad must have been shocked.</font>

620
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,008
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

621
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:57,968
<font color="yellow">Did he agree to the divorce?</font>

622
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,268
<font color="yellow">It's just like what your aunt says.</font>

623
00:40:07,768 --> 00:40:10,338
<font color="yellow">I tried to keep my husband under control,</font>

624
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:12,808
<font color="yellow">but I've been betrayed.</font>

625
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:14,938
<font color="yellow">He's the one who wants a divorce.</font>

626
00:40:16,138 --> 00:40:18,408
<font color="yellow">Dad is the one who wants a divorce?</font>

627
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:19,708
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

628
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:22,868
<font color="yellow">I always thought that if we do get a divorce,</font>

629
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:25,308
<font color="yellow">it would be me giving him the papers.</font>

630
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:27,768
<font color="yellow">Your dad is one scary man.</font>

631
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,838
<font color="yellow">He got everything ready then gave me the papers.</font>

632
00:40:31,268 --> 00:40:33,038
<font color="yellow">He filled in everything himself.</font>

633
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:36,368
<font color="yellow">That's the kind of person your dad is.</font>

634
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,908
<font color="yellow">He fooled me for 40 years.</font>

635
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,078
<font color="yellow">He'll be here next week to file it.</font>

636
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,538
<font color="yellow">If we're going to get a divorce, we should get it over with.</font>

637
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:48,738
<font color="yellow">Until then, don't tell your brother and sister.</font>

638
00:40:57,608 --> 00:40:59,308
<font color="yellow">We should go to Seoul.</font>

639
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,908
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going? - No.</font>

640
00:41:03,738 --> 00:41:05,808
<font color="yellow">- Does she want a divorce? - What?</font>

641
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:08,738
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

642
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:12,108
<font color="yellow">Even if she says she wants a divorce, you should have said no.</font>

643
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,668
<font color="yellow">What will you do at this age?</font>

644
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:21,538
<font color="yellow">If our parents were alive, they would be shocked.</font>

645
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,408
<font color="yellow">She's one cold-hearted woman.</font>

646
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:28,938
<font color="yellow">If you lived together for 40 years, she should keep living with you.</font>

647
00:41:29,308 --> 00:41:33,168
<font color="yellow">What good is she trying to get from kicking you out?</font>

648
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,968
<font color="yellow">She'll be punished.</font>

649
00:41:35,508 --> 00:41:36,708
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

650
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,968
<font color="yellow">She put up with me for a long time.</font>

651
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:40,108
<font color="yellow">Put up with what?</font>

652
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,438
<font color="yellow">And why are you giving her half your wealth?</font>

653
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,168
<font color="yellow">What did she do to deserve that?</font>

654
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:46,938
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

655
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:49,938
<font color="yellow">Don't try to meddle in others people's business.</font>

656
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,938
<font color="yellow">Maybe she has a man.</font>

657
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:58,838
<font color="yellow">Look at him. He looks anxious.</font>

658
00:42:07,268 --> 00:42:09,808
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Are you here alone?</font>

659
00:42:11,138 --> 00:42:13,078
<font color="yellow">Would you like some?</font>

660
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:14,468
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

661
00:42:15,008 --> 00:42:16,938
<font color="yellow">You're beautiful.</font>

662
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,908
<font color="yellow">You must have been very popular in your younger days.</font>

663
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:56,608
<font color="yellow">Se Gye, what are you up to?</font>

664
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:01,008
<font color="yellow">You're free for dinner these days, right? Do you want to have dinner?</font>

665
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:02,578
<font color="yellow">I have dinner plans.</font>

666
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:04,368
<font color="yellow">Let's take a rain check.</font>

667
00:43:05,138 --> 00:43:06,578
<font color="yellow">Or should I reschedule?</font>

668
00:43:06,908 --> 00:43:09,108
<font color="yellow">There's no need. If you have plans, we can eat another time.</font>

669
00:43:09,638 --> 00:43:10,808
<font color="yellow">Okay, bye.</font>

670
00:43:13,768 --> 00:43:15,808
<font color="yellow">- I'm back home. - Hey.</font>

671
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:19,708
<font color="yellow">Do you want to eat out tonight? It's on me.</font>

672
00:43:20,008 --> 00:43:22,838
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee got invited to a friend's birthday party.</font>

673
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:25,338
<font color="yellow">- I see. - Let's wear something nice.</font>

674
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,768
<font color="yellow">- Gab Soon. - Yes?</font>

675
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:38,538
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner tonight.</font>

676
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:41,738
<font color="yellow">I'm on a night shift tonight. I'll be home late.</font>

677
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:44,738
<font color="yellow">All right. Get back to work.</font>

678
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:52,508
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I made the right decision.</font>

679
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:57,468
<font color="yellow">I'm trying not to think about it. I'm enjoying my time these days.</font>

680
00:43:58,438 --> 00:43:59,568
<font color="yellow">I work in the morning.</font>

681
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:00,938
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

682
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,408
<font color="yellow">I don't make plans. I just get in the car and drive around.</font>

683
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:06,708
<font color="yellow">If I find a nice place,</font>

684
00:44:06,908 --> 00:44:09,568
<font color="yellow">I get out, take photos, and enjoy the view.</font>

685
00:44:10,238 --> 00:44:12,208
<font color="yellow">Then I have a local meal...</font>

686
00:44:12,808 --> 00:44:14,408
<font color="yellow">like sundae-gukbap and jjinppang.</font>

687
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:17,938
<font color="yellow">You're living your dream. I'm jealous.</font>

688
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,008
<font color="yellow">You're jealous, right?</font>

689
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:25,438
<font color="yellow">You don't think of me, do you?</font>

690
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:30,708
<font color="yellow">I'm not used to not seeing you everyday.</font>

691
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:33,708
<font color="yellow">It's hard.</font>

692
00:44:39,138 --> 00:44:40,808
<font color="yellow">Since I could see you everyday,</font>

693
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:43,868
<font color="yellow">the fact that you were married didn't hit me hard.</font>

694
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:46,808
<font color="yellow">It was the same for me.</font>

695
00:44:49,668 --> 00:44:50,768
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into me?</font>

696
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:52,368
<font color="yellow">Let's drink up.</font>

697
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:09,608
<font color="yellow">Don't bother doing that. You have poor eyesight.</font>

698
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,108
<font color="yellow">You'll hurt your back if you sit down for so long.</font>

699
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:14,608
<font color="yellow">I'll earn more money.</font>

700
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,408
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

701
00:45:16,968 --> 00:45:19,508
<font color="yellow">When I think of you moving water bottles and beer barrels,</font>

702
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,608
<font color="yellow">I feel the need to earn more.</font>

703
00:45:23,368 --> 00:45:24,638
<font color="yellow">This work brings in good income.</font>

704
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:28,068
<font color="yellow">The small one is worth 50 cents and the big one is worth 70 cents.</font>

705
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:31,608
<font color="yellow">It's fun. Time flies when I'm stringing these beads.</font>

706
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:34,338
<font color="yellow">- How many have you done? - Two.</font>

707
00:45:34,808 --> 00:45:36,808
<font color="yellow">That makes 1 dollar and 20 cents already.</font>

708
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,468
<font color="yellow">I can make money for instant noodles.</font>

709
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,108
<font color="yellow">Finish this and don't ever do this again.</font>

710
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:48,938
<font color="yellow">Speed up. The chairman will come for inspection.</font>

711
00:45:53,238 --> 00:45:54,308
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

712
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,868
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to run into you like this.</font>

713
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:07,608
<font color="yellow">You still didn't no need to break off all contact.</font>

714
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,308
<font color="yellow">I'll take any punishment you decide to give me.</font>

715
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,168
<font color="yellow">How do you want to be punished?</font>

716
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:15,708
<font color="yellow">Whatever you decide is fine.</font>

717
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,538
<font color="yellow">You know I'm a bad man, right?</font>

718
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:21,968
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

719
00:46:22,338 --> 00:46:24,538
<font color="yellow">You made me believe a song was your poem.</font>

720
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:26,538
<font color="yellow">Do you know I'm penniless?</font>

721
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:27,838
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

722
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:30,868
<font color="yellow">Do also you know that I've never went out with a woman?</font>

723
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:32,608
<font color="yellow">I should highlight that.</font>

724
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:36,708
<font color="yellow">Have you really never gone out with a woman before?</font>

725
00:46:37,468 --> 00:46:38,538
<font color="yellow">That explains it.</font>

726
00:46:38,538 --> 00:46:42,068
<font color="yellow">The man that ran away without paying the rent...</font>

727
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,508
<font color="yellow">is me.</font>

728
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,268
<font color="yellow">I'm that scrooge.</font>

729
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:48,468
<font color="yellow">You are unbelievable.</font>

730
00:46:55,008 --> 00:46:56,508
<font color="yellow">Can I sleep over for the night?</font>

731
00:46:56,968 --> 00:46:58,568
<font color="yellow">Half of this house is my brother's.</font>

732
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:00,868
<font color="yellow">How did you come? What about Dad?</font>

733
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:03,708
<font color="yellow">I have something to say. Have a seat.</font>

734
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:08,068
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter? - Sit down if you did nothing wrong.</font>

735
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:11,168
<font color="yellow">I sat. What do you want?</font>

736
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:14,268
<font color="yellow">Do you have a man?</font>

737
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:17,208
<font color="yellow">- Aunt. - Leave her. Let's hear her out.</font>

738
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:21,438
<font color="yellow">My brother never cheated on you, beat you, or gambled.</font>

739
00:47:22,168 --> 00:47:24,238
<font color="yellow">How could you ask for a divorce?</font>

740
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,468
<font color="yellow">Jae Soon, what do you think?</font>

741
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:30,138
<font color="yellow">Since your the oldest, you must have an opinion about this.</font>

742
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:33,208
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's right for your dad to get asked for a divorce?</font>

743
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:36,008
<font color="yellow">Aunt, you should stay out of this. It's their business.</font>

744
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:37,108
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

745
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:41,608
<font color="yellow">So I guess you're all on your mum's side.</font>

746
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:45,568
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that. You'll be punished.</font>

747
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:48,008
<font color="yellow">You should be thankful that my brother's a kind man.</font>

748
00:47:48,308 --> 00:47:51,968
<font color="yellow">What has your mum done to receive half of his wealth?</font>

749
00:47:52,738 --> 00:47:55,568
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your conscience?</font>

750
00:47:55,768 --> 00:47:59,508
<font color="yellow">Aunt. It's normal to split the wealth in half these days.</font>

751
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:00,538
<font color="yellow">You should think twice.</font>

752
00:48:00,908 --> 00:48:02,168
<font color="yellow">What do you mean Mum did nothing?</font>

753
00:48:03,238 --> 00:48:06,038
<font color="yellow">She did more than she ever had to.</font>

754
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:09,208
<font color="yellow">She supported Dad and raised us three kids.</font>

755
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:12,408
<font color="yellow">She did good to your parents and Uncle as well as you.</font>

756
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:15,408
<font color="yellow">She even took care of Grandma and Grandpa when they were sick.</font>

757
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:18,268
<font color="yellow">What do you think would have happened without her?</font>

758
00:48:18,668 --> 00:48:20,538
<font color="yellow">Can that be counted with money?</font>

759
00:48:21,508 --> 00:48:24,538
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't say that as a woman. That's being ignorant.</font>

760
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:27,308
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Ignorant?</font>

761
00:48:27,668 --> 00:48:30,908
<font color="yellow">Dad went through a lot, but Mum did as well.</font>

762
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,868
<font color="yellow">I understand why she wants a divorce.</font>

763
00:48:34,268 --> 00:48:35,638
<font color="yellow">Don't butt in.</font>

764
00:48:35,968 --> 00:48:37,668
<font color="yellow">If you're going to be like this, don't come here.</font>

765
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:38,868
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

766
00:48:39,508 --> 00:48:41,868
<font color="yellow">Your kids are on your side.</font>

767
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:47,808
<font color="yellow">It's a great thing that you're wanting a divorce.</font>

768
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:52,108
<font color="yellow">If you let my brother go earlier,</font>

769
00:48:52,608 --> 00:48:55,708
<font color="yellow">he would have lost less hair. I'm sure of that.</font>

770
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,108
<font color="yellow">Yes, don't you worry.</font>

771
00:48:58,638 --> 00:49:00,338
<font color="yellow">I'll cut off clean.</font>

772
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:01,538
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

773
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:03,808
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

774
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,908
<font color="yellow">Didn't you go to bed?</font>

775
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:25,938
<font color="yellow">I came out for a glass of water.</font>

776
00:49:27,038 --> 00:49:28,738
<font color="yellow">You had a glass of water earlier.</font>

777
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:01,368
<font color="yellow">Why did you come all the way here?</font>

778
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:05,708
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I should tell you this over the phone.</font>

779
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:08,808
<font color="yellow">I want to speak to you in person.</font>

780
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,868
<font color="yellow">Is it urgent?</font>

781
00:50:13,068 --> 00:50:15,308
<font color="yellow">I saw your divorce papers.</font>

782
00:50:17,108 --> 00:50:19,268
<font color="yellow">I heard you asked Mum for a divorce.</font>

783
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:21,908
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

784
00:50:24,738 --> 00:50:27,838
<font color="yellow">It's between me and your mum, so don't worry about it.</font>

785
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:30,508
<font color="yellow">Do your siblings know?</font>

786
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:32,608
<font color="yellow">Only I saw it.</font>

787
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:35,868
<font color="yellow">I'm still in shock.</font>

788
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,808
<font color="yellow">I don't think they'll be able to handle it.</font>

789
00:50:39,738 --> 00:50:41,138
<font color="yellow">It's not exactly the same,</font>

790
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,968
<font color="yellow">but I know how shocking it must have been for you when I got divorced.</font>

791
00:50:48,138 --> 00:50:49,968
<font color="yellow">Mum doesn't know that I am here.</font>

792
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:54,268
<font color="yellow">I always thought Mum would be the one to ask for a divorce.</font>

793
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:58,038
<font color="yellow">She had to hold back so much.</font>

794
00:50:58,508 --> 00:51:00,608
<font color="yellow">Grandma treated her poorly when she married you,</font>

795
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:03,638
<font color="yellow">and she took care of Grandpa when he was hospitalised.</font>

796
00:51:04,238 --> 00:51:06,408
<font color="yellow">She raised your younger siblings...</font>

797
00:51:06,638 --> 00:51:08,638
<font color="yellow">and married them off.</font>

798
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:11,408
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

799
00:51:12,908 --> 00:51:14,838
<font color="yellow">You at least had your time outside when you worked,</font>

800
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:17,538
<font color="yellow">but she never got recognised for what she did.</font>

801
00:51:17,668 --> 00:51:20,168
<font color="yellow">She dedicated her life to being our mum and your wife.</font>

802
00:51:20,808 --> 00:51:22,668
<font color="yellow">I've been living as a housewife,</font>

803
00:51:23,368 --> 00:51:25,008
<font color="yellow">so I know how she feels.</font>

804
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:29,138
<font color="yellow">It's tiring to be a working mum,</font>

805
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:31,408
<font color="yellow">but you still keep your identity.</font>

806
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:35,068
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd understand.</font>

807
00:51:37,168 --> 00:51:38,438
<font color="yellow">How do you think...</font>

808
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:42,468
<font color="yellow">Mum would have felt when you asked her for a divorce?</font>

809
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:45,508
<font color="yellow">I respect you,</font>

810
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:48,338
<font color="yellow">but I don't think this is right.</font>

811
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:52,008
<font color="yellow">It makes a difference whether you initiated the divorce or not.</font>

812
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,238
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you have let Mum...</font>

813
00:51:56,038 --> 00:51:57,808
<font color="yellow">keep her pride?</font>

814
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:02,838
<font color="yellow">I think I would be sad and furious.</font>

815
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:05,668
<font color="yellow">She sacrificed her whole life for the family,</font>

816
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:10,568
<font color="yellow">but all she gets is divorce papers from her own husband.</font>

817
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,838
<font color="yellow">Mum can't even sleep without alcohol.</font>

818
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,608
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since you've been outside, right?</font>

819
00:52:27,508 --> 00:52:29,768
<font color="yellow">I hope you're more at ease now.</font>

820
00:52:30,338 --> 00:52:32,038
<font color="yellow">It must have been hard for you.</font>

821
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:35,308
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for your husband,</font>

822
00:52:36,068 --> 00:52:37,768
<font color="yellow">but it worked out for the best.</font>

823
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:42,168
<font color="yellow">They say the dead are the ones who are at loss. I guess it's right.</font>

824
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:44,908
<font color="yellow">Life still goes on for the ones who are still alive.</font>

825
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:49,368
<font color="yellow">Even after my husband died, I was able to eat and sleep.</font>

826
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:53,208
<font color="yellow">Your children are all just useless.</font>

827
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:55,408
<font color="yellow">Your husband is the best.</font>

828
00:52:56,868 --> 00:52:59,408
<font color="yellow">It's not like we were the happiest couple,</font>

829
00:52:59,908 --> 00:53:02,368
<font color="yellow">but it feels like one of my arms fell off.</font>

830
00:53:03,438 --> 00:53:04,608
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

831
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:07,938
<font color="yellow">really all alone now.</font>

832
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:13,738
<font color="yellow">When he was bedridden, we argued so much.</font>

833
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:16,908
<font color="yellow">I told him to die...</font>

834
00:53:17,468 --> 00:53:18,708
<font color="yellow">instead of...</font>

835
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:21,568
<font color="yellow">making me suffer.</font>

836
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:24,468
<font color="yellow">You did everything you can.</font>

837
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:29,138
<font color="yellow">Anybody would have said that after doing that for seven years.</font>

838
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:31,868
<font color="yellow">It's difficult to take care of someone for a long time.</font>

839
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:35,838
<font color="yellow">Even a year or two is difficult.</font>

840
00:53:36,738 --> 00:53:39,768
<font color="yellow">We all think you're incredible.</font>

841
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:42,108
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

842
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,068
<font color="yellow">what I regret the most?</font>

843
00:53:46,068 --> 00:53:48,068
<font color="yellow">I've never told him...</font>

844
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:52,108
<font color="yellow">how sorry or thankful I was.</font>

845
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:57,608
<font color="yellow">He worked all his life to support the family and raise the kids.</font>

846
00:53:58,508 --> 00:54:02,108
<font color="yellow">I never thanked him for it.</font>

847
00:54:03,268 --> 00:54:07,268
<font color="yellow">I regret that the most. It pains me deeply.</font>

848
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,008
<font color="yellow">I should have told him.</font>

849
00:54:13,468 --> 00:54:17,508
<font color="yellow">You should be thankful that your husband is healthy.</font>

850
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,768
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, tell him when it's not too late.</font>

851
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:24,938
<font color="yellow">He'll never know if you don't say it.</font>

852
00:54:56,308 --> 00:54:58,108
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

853
00:54:58,468 --> 00:54:59,568
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

854
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:01,908
<font color="yellow">And thank you.</font>

855
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:05,868
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I regret the most?</font>

856
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:09,768
<font color="yellow">I've never told him how sorry...</font>

857
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:11,808
<font color="yellow">or thankful I was.</font>

858
00:55:12,368 --> 00:55:15,608
<font color="yellow">Nae Shim, don't be like that.</font>

859
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:27,238
<font color="yellow">Do Geum, where were you?</font>

860
00:56:27,338 --> 00:56:29,268
<font color="yellow">Look, it's a baby.</font>

861
00:56:32,938 --> 00:56:35,868
<font color="yellow">Please raise him well.</font>

862
00:56:36,638 --> 00:56:39,108
<font color="yellow">His birthday is December 3.</font>

863
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:42,208
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? You can't even feed yourself.</font>

864
00:56:42,368 --> 00:56:44,808
<font color="yellow">As soon as I looked at him,</font>

865
00:56:45,408 --> 00:56:47,008
<font color="yellow">I had the urge to live.</font>

866
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:48,968
<font color="yellow">Look at him. Isn't he cute?</font>

867
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:02,538
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam.</font>

868
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:07,138
<font color="yellow">Can you make me seaweed soup for breakfast tomorrow?</font>

869
00:57:07,908 --> 00:57:08,968
<font color="yellow">Is it somebody's birthday?</font>

870
00:57:09,068 --> 00:57:10,968
<font color="yellow">It's my precious son's birthday.</font>

871
00:57:12,038 --> 00:57:13,538
<font color="yellow">Please make it with beef.</font>

872
00:57:14,568 --> 00:57:15,568
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

873
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:18,038
<font color="yellow">Don't bother. I'll make seaweed soup.</font>

874
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:19,968
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ms Nam.</font>

875
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:23,208
<font color="yellow">Can you make some side dishes with meat, too?</font>

876
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:25,108
<font color="yellow">Bulgogi would be good.</font>

877
00:57:26,668 --> 00:57:28,268
<font color="yellow">Hurry. Hurry up.</font>

878
00:57:29,168 --> 00:57:30,638
<font color="yellow">Don't rush me.</font>

879
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:34,168
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo has to leave for work. I have to feed him now.</font>

880
00:57:39,408 --> 00:57:41,608
<font color="yellow">Eat before you go. It's warm seaweed soup.</font>

881
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:44,108
<font color="yellow">Ms Nam made bulgogi as well.</font>

882
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:45,738
<font color="yellow">I can just get some gimbap.</font>

883
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:47,968
<font color="yellow">You can't starve on a day like this.</font>

884
00:57:48,268 --> 00:57:49,738
<font color="yellow">Today's your birthday.</font>

885
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:52,168
<font color="yellow">- Eat up. - Really?</font>

886
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:56,138
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday, my son.</font>

887
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,938
<font color="yellow">Did you ask her to make seaweed soup?</font>

888
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:01,538
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

889
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:04,368
<font color="yellow">Eat.</font>

890
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,408
<font color="yellow">- You should eat, too. - Okay.</font>

891
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:18,238
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

892
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:20,008
<font color="yellow">Open it.</font>

893
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:29,238
<font color="yellow">Those are your mum's shoes.</font>

894
00:58:36,468 --> 00:58:37,608
<font color="yellow">Did she die?</font>

895
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:06,838
<font color="yellow">Did you find him?</font>

896
00:59:07,768 --> 00:59:08,768
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

897
00:59:08,938 --> 00:59:11,938
<font color="yellow">They went bankrupt soon after,</font>

898
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:14,508
<font color="yellow">so they moved 30 years ago.</font>

899
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:17,038
<font color="yellow">And then what happened? Where did they go?</font>

900
00:59:17,308 --> 00:59:18,638
<font color="yellow">Their entire family...</font>

901
00:59:18,938 --> 00:59:21,708
<font color="yellow">moved to Bongcheon-dong.</font>

902
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,908
<font color="yellow">Bongcheon-dong?</font>

903
00:59:23,638 --> 00:59:27,068
<font color="yellow">They haven't updated their address, so it's difficult to find them.</font>

904
00:59:27,608 --> 00:59:30,138
<font color="yellow">It took me over a week...</font>

905
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:32,708
<font color="yellow">just to find out that they moved to Bongcheon-dong.</font>

906
00:59:33,338 --> 00:59:35,938
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. Did you find him or not?</font>

907
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:40,338
<font color="yellow">All I know is that he attended elementary school there.</font>

908
00:59:40,608 --> 00:59:42,338
<font color="yellow">He attended elementary school?</font>

909
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:44,908
<font color="yellow">What about now?</font>

910
00:59:45,108 --> 00:59:49,368
<font color="yellow">They moved again to Miari. We're looking for them.</font>

911
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:53,068
<font color="yellow">I have three of my guys on it.</font>

912
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:56,908
<font color="yellow">It's not easy finding people.</font>

913
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:01,468
<font color="yellow">Please, find him.</font>

914
01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:04,808
<font color="yellow">He must be alive, right? He has to be.</font>

915
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:23,608
<font color="yellow">He was definitely alive at least until elementary school.</font>

916
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:44,408
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

917
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,868
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong, I want this.</font>

918
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:52,868
<font color="yellow">I'll make you ramyeon at home. It'll be delicious.</font>

919
01:00:53,438 --> 01:00:54,908
<font color="yellow">I'll add green onions and an egg.</font>

920
01:00:55,408 --> 01:00:57,768
<font color="yellow">No, I want this.</font>

921
01:00:58,038 --> 01:00:59,208
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a piggy back.</font>

922
01:01:06,638 --> 01:01:07,668
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong.</font>

923
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:17,338
<font color="yellow">I heard you moved.</font>

924
01:01:18,638 --> 01:01:19,808
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

925
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:27,038
<font color="yellow">Is Da Rong sick?</font>

926
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:30,538
<font color="yellow">No, she fell asleep.</font>

927
01:01:33,808 --> 01:01:35,068
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go on, then.</font>

928
01:01:40,668 --> 01:01:41,768
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin.</font>

929
01:01:51,238 --> 01:01:52,968
<font color="yellow">Can you please come back?</font>

930
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:10,608
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong!</font>

931
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:24,268
<font color="yellow">Lucky you.</font>

932
01:03:24,538 --> 01:03:26,868
<font color="yellow">Look at you all carefree and going to the sauna.</font>

933
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:30,138
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for my brother who got kicked out.</font>

934
01:03:30,508 --> 01:03:34,338
<font color="yellow">You made up your mind, so don't drag this on.</font>

935
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:37,738
<font color="yellow">Give him his share of the asset. Let him enjoy his life, too.</font>

936
01:03:44,668 --> 01:03:48,138
<font color="yellow">Our trip to Jeju Island got scrapped because of Nae Shim.</font>

937
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:49,808
<font color="yellow">Going to the sauna is good enough.</font>

938
01:03:50,168 --> 01:03:51,768
<font color="yellow">Did you bring your towels?</font>

939
01:03:51,938 --> 01:03:53,508
<font color="yellow">- Of course we did. - Of course we did.</font>

940
01:03:59,968 --> 01:04:01,308
<font color="yellow">We can't forget our towels.</font>

941
01:04:01,608 --> 01:04:02,768
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

942
01:04:05,438 --> 01:04:08,508
<font color="yellow">Where are you, Nae Shim? We're all here.</font>

943
01:04:08,938 --> 01:04:11,908
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to join. I have a family emergency.</font>

944
01:04:12,138 --> 01:04:13,838
<font color="yellow">I hope you enjoy yourselves.</font>

945
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:21,868
<font color="yellow">One ticket to Sokcho, please.</font>
