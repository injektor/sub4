<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you? I have to clean this up.</font>

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
<font color="yellow">She is no longer working here as of today.</font>

157
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,210
<font color="yellow">Wait...</font>

158
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,370
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

159
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,600
<font color="yellow">Don't resist me with force. I have no energy.</font>

160
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,039
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

161
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,139
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to see you. - I came because I missed you.</font>

162
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,070
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you listening to me? I told you...</font>

163
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:21,299
<font color="yellow">not to work at the restaurant.</font>

164
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,940
<font color="yellow">Why would I listen to you?</font>

165
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:25,370
<font color="yellow">You should listen to me while you work at my house.</font>

166
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,500
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since I quit working at your house.</font>

167
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,039
<font color="yellow">You should've waited like I told you to.</font>

168
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,669
<font color="yellow">Why are you working here?</font>

169
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,299
<font color="yellow">You're not even well.</font>

170
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,710
<font color="yellow">I told you that I have a reason behind all this.</font>

171
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,799
<font color="yellow">You should've counted on me. Why can't you understand?</font>

172
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,269
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I understand you very well.</font>

173
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,039
<font color="yellow">I know that you're doing this because of your daughter.</font>

174
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:51,039
<font color="yellow">- That's not it. - What do you mean, that's not it?</font>

175
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,899
<font color="yellow">You will never overcome your daughter.</font>

176
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,970
<font color="yellow">If you weren't a woman,</font>

177
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,899
<font color="yellow">I would've beaten you up.</font>

178
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:00,399
<font color="yellow">I'm holding it in.</font>

179
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,470
<font color="yellow">How would you know a man's considerate heart?</font>

180
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,570
<font color="yellow">Is that why you ripped the marriage registration form?</font>

181
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,639
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

182
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,769
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd do that because of your personality.</font>

183
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,340
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you know it.</font>

184
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,100
<font color="yellow">If you're done speaking, please go.</font>

185
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,539
<font color="yellow">Please listen to me. I told you I have no energy.</font>

186
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,669
<font color="yellow">Take this with you again.</font>

187
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,769
<font color="yellow">You saved this money for your son's marriage.</font>

188
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,399
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back even if I have to sell my body.</font>

189
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,570
<font color="yellow">Is there anyone who would pay you for that?</font>

190
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,970
<font color="yellow">You have a nice son.</font>

191
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,269
<font color="yellow">When did you ever see my son?</font>

192
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,070
<font color="yellow">If he takes after you, he'll be nice.</font>

193
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,500
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

194
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,169
<font color="yellow">Make do with this for now...</font>

195
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,899
<font color="yellow">and don't work.</font>

196
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,840
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

197
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,070
<font color="yellow">Are you playing with me?</font>

198
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,899
<font color="yellow">Do you think money can buy you everything?</font>

199
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,769
<font color="yellow">There are some things you can't solve with money.</font>

200
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,070
<font color="yellow">You said all those sweet words as you suggested to get married.</font>

201
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,370
<font color="yellow">Now, you're giving me a few bucks so I'd leave.</font>

202
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,539
<font color="yellow">Even though I'm penniless who cleans others' dirty houses,</font>

203
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,340
<font color="yellow">you got me wrong.</font>

204
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:14,570
<font color="yellow">I've chased after money all my life,</font>

205
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,100
<font color="yellow">but I don't need this kind of money.</font>

206
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,200
<font color="yellow">Don't sway my mind like this.</font>

207
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,500
<font color="yellow">I haven't moved out yet.</font>

208
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,539
<font color="yellow">Do you have soju?</font>

209
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,240
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to sing you a song?</font>

210
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,799
<font color="yellow">I know we're now strangers</font>

211
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,700
<font color="yellow">- Forget it. - All right.</font>

212
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,970
<font color="yellow">There's a snowstorm in this frigid winter.</font>

213
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:10,440
<font color="yellow">Where would I go with my son?</font>

214
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,940
<font color="yellow">Don't move out.</font>

215
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,370
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ms Nam.</font>

216
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,070
<font color="yellow">We might become attached with one another.</font>

217
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,870
<font color="yellow">"I don't know why I'm doing this."</font>

218
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,870
<font color="yellow">"I really don't know why I'm doing this."</font>

219
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,100
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

220
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,970
<font color="yellow">- You're going to buy socks? - Yes.</font>

221
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:45,970
<font color="yellow">Pick what you want. I'll buy you socks of all colours.</font>

222
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,570
<font color="yellow">You're getting me socks by each colour?</font>

223
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,070
<font color="yellow">I'll get you socks today, but once I make money, I'll get you cars.</font>

224
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,139
<font color="yellow">Handbags are not fun.</font>

225
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,500
<font color="yellow">You should get me houses by each colour, too.</font>

226
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,169
<font color="yellow">Sure, I can do that. I'll get you houses by each colour.</font>

227
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,299
<font color="yellow">What a liar. Is that how you coaxed women?</font>

228
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,169
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm doing right now.</font>

229
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,370
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I should go along with it or not.</font>

230
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,740
<font color="yellow">It's so pretty. Can I get a lot?</font>

231
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,940
<font color="yellow">Buy enough to last the winter.</font>

232
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,570
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wear them by myself.</font>

233
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,970
<font color="yellow">I'll think about you whenever I put them on.</font>

234
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,039
<font color="yellow">There are no gloves here. Do you sell gloves too?</font>

235
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,470
<font color="yellow">They're pretty.</font>

236
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,600
<font color="yellow">What is it? Is it food?</font>

237
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,600
<font color="yellow">- No, it's not food. - What is it, then?</font>

238
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,970
<font color="yellow">It's not food.</font>

239
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,769
<font color="yellow">What is it, then?</font>

240
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:42,039
<font color="yellow">You bought socks?</font>

241
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,600
<font color="yellow">Good thing you bought socks. I was about to get them.</font>

242
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,200
<font color="yellow">That's why I got them.</font>

243
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,470
<font color="yellow">You got all the colourful ones.</font>

244
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,470
<font color="yellow">- Who got them for you? - Who would get me socks?</font>

245
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,039
<font color="yellow">Where did you get them? They're warm.</font>

246
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,470
<font color="yellow">We can share it amongst the family.</font>

247
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,340
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - They're nice.</font>

248
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,070
<font color="yellow">They're nice.</font>

249
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,440
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for you.</font>

250
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,799
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do.</font>

251
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,299
<font color="yellow">I told my mum I'll marry Gab Soon,</font>

252
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,139
<font color="yellow">but I don't want to watch my mum like that.</font>

253
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,669
<font color="yellow">You can't betray Gab Soon just because of your mum.</font>

254
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,100
<font color="yellow">- This is driving me nuts. - Don't go nuts.</font>

255
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,070
<font color="yellow">This is all because you became a public official.</font>

256
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,299
<font color="yellow">(Gab Soon)</font>

257
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,399
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you calling? Is something going on?</font>

258
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,539
<font color="yellow">We're going to stick to our plan, right?</font>

259
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,339
<font color="yellow">Aren't you eating?</font>

260
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,269
<font color="yellow">I have to go clean early.</font>

261
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,740
<font color="yellow">And I'm going to marry Gab Dol, just to let you know.</font>

262
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,539
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

263
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. I need to go clean and get ready for my wedding.</font>

264
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,569
<font color="yellow">She's so stubborn.</font>

265
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,569
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Are you mad?</font>

266
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,569
<font color="yellow">I should have been this way from the beginning. It's time.</font>

267
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,240
<font color="yellow">Do you like him that much? Do you like him more than your parents?</font>

268
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,299
<font color="yellow">- Did he talk you into this? - No, this is all my idea.</font>

269
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,240
<font color="yellow">Don't you know your own daughter?</font>

270
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,369
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm going to let anybody talk me into anything.</font>

271
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,839
<font color="yellow">I wooed Gab Dol from the beginning.</font>

272
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,440
<font color="yellow">You must be proud of yourself.</font>

273
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,670
<font color="yellow">Mum, I have a long way to go.</font>

274
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,299
<font color="yellow">I need to get his mum's approval, and I have a lot of cleaning jobs.</font>

275
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,140
<font color="yellow">Please, don't make my life harder.</font>

276
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,910
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Gab Dol no matter what.</font>

277
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,470
<font color="yellow">Do something about your daughter.</font>

278
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,170
<font color="yellow">We can't let her go crazy like that.</font>

279
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,369
<font color="yellow">You can't do anything to stop her.</font>

280
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,369
<font color="yellow">Let her be. The wedding won't happen. I'm 100 percent sure.</font>

281
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,170
<font color="yellow">She can't marry by herself. She won't last long, Mum. Let her be.</font>

282
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,240
<font color="yellow">What do you think will happen? I need your psychic ability.</font>

283
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,240
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say about this.</font>

284
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,069
<font color="yellow">My psychic ability must have waned.</font>

285
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,940
<font color="yellow">If I get some money,</font>

286
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,970
<font color="yellow">I might get it right.</font>

287
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,200
<font color="yellow">Just eat.</font>

288
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,940
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

289
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,470
<font color="yellow">Mum, did you eat?</font>

290
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,700
<font color="yellow">I don't have an appetite.</font>

291
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,910
<font color="yellow">Don't starve. I'll get food on my way home.</font>

292
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,039
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

293
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,769
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

294
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,599
<font color="yellow">How dare you come here?</font>

295
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,069
<font color="yellow">I wanted to say my season's greetings and talk to you.</font>

296
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,140
<font color="yellow">You said these were pretty when I wore them a few years ago.</font>

297
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean it. You really think I found them pretty?</font>

298
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,170
<font color="yellow">You're clueless and foolishly daring.</font>

299
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,470
<font color="yellow">Is that how your parents taught you?</font>

300
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,299
<font color="yellow">This is expensive Korean beef. I make money now.</font>

301
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,410
<font color="yellow">I don't get pension,</font>

302
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,640
<font color="yellow">but I earn a little more than a public official's wage.</font>

303
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
<font color="yellow">Please, take my bow.</font>

304
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,200
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat. - What's wrong with you?</font>

305
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,599
<font color="yellow">This is why I don't like you.</font>

306
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,970
<font color="yellow">How dare you come here on your own when Gab Dol is not here?</font>

307
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,839
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have a fight?</font>

308
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:54,539
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do this.</font>

309
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,369
<font color="yellow">I have made my determination.</font>

310
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,970
<font color="yellow">I'll let you criticise me.</font>

311
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
<font color="yellow">If you hit me, I'll take it.</font>

312
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,269
<font color="yellow">It's been over 10 years. I know you well.</font>

313
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,269
<font color="yellow">Please, approve our marriage.</font>

314
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,240
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol wanted to go ahead without your approval, but I'll wait.</font>

315
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,539
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

316
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,910
<font color="yellow">Get out. Get out right now.</font>

317
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:20,069
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - I'm speechless.</font>

318
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,299
<font color="yellow">Do you think this makes sense? You heard everything, right?</font>

319
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,240
<font color="yellow">I was busy minding my own business, so I didn't hear everything.</font>

320
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:27,940
<font color="yellow">Look at her.</font>

321
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,369
<font color="yellow">She's pretty. Hanbok looks nice on you.</font>

322
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,269
<font color="yellow">That's not why I wanted you to look at her.</font>

323
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:38,299
<font color="yellow">She's so spoiled. This is why I don't like you.</font>

324
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,039
<font color="yellow">She's been controlling Gab Dol for 10 years like this.</font>

325
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,700
<font color="yellow">How could you think of wearing hanbok and visiting me?</font>

326
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,299
<font color="yellow">Drag her out for me.</font>

327
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,269
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

328
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,539
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

329
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,339
<font color="yellow">I have no energy. I have a headache.</font>

330
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,200
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'll be good to you.</font>

331
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,640
<font color="yellow">I'll be your daughter and a daughter-in-law.</font>

332
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,240
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear that from you. I just don't like you.</font>

333
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:09,410
<font color="yellow">I already want someone else as my daughter-in-law, so leave.</font>

334
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,500
<font color="yellow">Don't just watch. Drag her out.</font>

335
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,200
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Gab Soon.</font>

336
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,269
<font color="yellow">I won't back down.</font>

337
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,470
<font color="yellow">Mother, take my bow.</font>

338
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,910
<font color="yellow">- What? - She wants to bow.</font>

339
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,339
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Didn't you hear me?</font>

340
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,410
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

341
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,170
<font color="yellow">Please, have a seat.</font>

342
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:30,940
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

343
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:32,839
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

344
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,240
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon, bow now if you're going to.</font>

345
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,839
<font color="yellow">I won't take your bow. I'll never take it.</font>

346
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,769
<font color="yellow">She's done.</font>

347
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,140
<font color="yellow">I'm lacking in many ways,</font>

348
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:52,940
<font color="yellow">but I'll become a better daughter-in-law than office workers.</font>

349
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,900
<font color="yellow">I won't let Gab Dol work too hard. I'll make him happy.</font>

350
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,269
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it.</font>

351
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,869
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol and I have been...</font>

352
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,140
<font color="yellow">dating for 11 years now.</font>

353
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:05,869
<font color="yellow">We tried breaking up a few times, but we couldn't.</font>

354
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,970
<font color="yellow">I'll never meet anybody more precious than him.</font>

355
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,799
<font color="yellow">We're childhood friends, so I didn't treat him with respect.</font>

356
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,299
<font color="yellow">I know you didn't like that about me.</font>

357
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,799
<font color="yellow">Once we get married, I'll treat him respectfully as my husband.</font>

358
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:24,569
<font color="yellow">Mother, please give us your approval.</font>

359
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,900
<font color="yellow">I want to make you my daughter-in-law.</font>

360
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,670
<font color="yellow">She bought expensive meat.</font>

361
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want this.</font>

362
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,299
<font color="yellow">Did you see that? Do you want me to die of anger?</font>

363
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,140
<font color="yellow">If you don't want it, can I have it?</font>

364
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,440
<font color="yellow">She comes to my house wearing hanbok,</font>

365
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,140
<font color="yellow">forces me to take her bow and says whatever she wants to.</font>

366
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,269
<font color="yellow">Do I deserve to hear this from her?</font>

367
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,869
<font color="yellow">Was this your idea or hers?</font>

368
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:58,140
<font color="yellow">It was mine.</font>

369
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,700
<font color="yellow">Is it so incredible that your son is a public official?</font>

370
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,500
<font color="yellow">Other people will laugh at us.</font>

371
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,970
<font color="yellow">We have so little to be proud of in our family except this.</font>

372
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,670
<font color="yellow">If I had other abilities, I wouldn't have become a public official.</font>

373
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,539
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Gab Soon? She's 1,000 times better than me.</font>

374
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,900
<font color="yellow">If I manage to keep my post, I'll consider myself lucky.</font>

375
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:19,240
<font color="yellow">Gab Soon will make her company grow and do an interior design business.</font>

376
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,240
<font color="yellow">She'll also own a car and hire a personal chauffeur.</font>

377
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,740
<font color="yellow">A person like me will never be able to do that.</font>

378
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,740
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live a poor life any more.</font>

379
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,670
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Gab Soon and benefit from her.</font>

380
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,900
<font color="yellow">I'll marry her even if you say no.</font>

381
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,200
<font color="yellow">You saw that, right? You saw that with your own eyes.</font>

382
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:39,799
<font color="yellow">You saw him yelling at me, right?</font>

383
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,970
<font color="yellow">Are you happy that you drove my family apart?</font>

384
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:47,140
<font color="yellow">Things are bad already. Imagine how it'll be once you get married.</font>

385
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,970
<font color="yellow">Isn't it obvious how things will be?</font>

386
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,269
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get away from me!</font>

387
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,900
<font color="yellow">How did you think of coming to my house by yourself?</font>

388
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,269
<font color="yellow">That was unexpected.</font>

389
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,539
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'd only do what you expect?</font>

390
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,299
<font color="yellow">I'm unpredictable.</font>

391
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:35,069
<font color="yellow">Don't come by yourself from now on. You'll get all the abuse.</font>

392
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,569
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hide.</font>

393
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,299
<font color="yellow">It's something we have to go through.</font>

394
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,299
<font color="yellow">Don't get angry at your mum. She'll take it out on me.</font>

395
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,769
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

396
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,099
<font color="yellow">You're pretty today.</font>

397
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,869
<font color="yellow">You look like a newly-wed.</font>

398
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,069
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol, do you really think I'll be successful?</font>

399
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,369
<font color="yellow">I was touched by what you said earlier.</font>

400
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,740
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you believed in me that much.</font>

401
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,869
<font color="yellow">I'm marrying you to benefit from you.</font>

402
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:02,299
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. I'll be the breadwinner.</font>

403
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,970
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to hear the most.</font>

404
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,039
<font color="yellow">"I'll be the breadwinner."</font>

405
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,740
<font color="yellow">That's a lot more touching...</font>

406
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,440
<font color="yellow">than hearing you say that you love me.</font>

407
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:14,599
<font color="yellow">I'm serious, too. I'll be successful.</font>

408
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,099
<font color="yellow">I'll make her regret for looking down on me.</font>

409
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,339
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry you and not give up.</font>

410
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,740
<font color="yellow">Remember what you said before?</font>

411
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:24,440
<font color="yellow">You said I was the one who protected our love.</font>

412
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
<font color="yellow">No, it was all you.</font>

413
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:31,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything.</font>

414
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,200
<font color="yellow">I was timid and cowardly.</font>

415
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,500
<font color="yellow">All I did was complain.</font>

416
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,740
<font color="yellow">- You're incredible. - I know. I'm incredible.</font>

417
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,539
<font color="yellow">I'm late. I have to go and clean. See you.</font>

418
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,839
<font color="yellow">Be careful. You'll fall.</font>

419
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
<font color="yellow">- Welcome. - Hello.</font>

420
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,170
<font color="yellow">Put them here.</font>

421
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,140
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

422
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,869
<font color="yellow">Come out, Nae Shim.</font>

423
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,769
<font color="yellow">- Wait for me downstairs. - Yes, Sir.</font>

424
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,470
<font color="yellow">- How have you been? - Great.</font>

425
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,700
<font color="yellow">- I'm here, Mother. - Welcome, Se Bang.</font>

426
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,269
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring so many things?</font>

427
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,339
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

428
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:19,299
<font color="yellow">I got New Year's gifts for everybody.</font>

429
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,099
<font color="yellow">Where's Father? I reserved a restaurant for lunch.</font>

430
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:26,069
<font color="yellow">He left a while ago. I don't know where he went.</font>

431
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,940
<font color="yellow">We can wait for him. He should be home soon.</font>

432
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,000
<font color="yellow">You should be asking for Jae Soon,</font>

433
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,700
<font color="yellow">not my brother.</font>

434
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,299
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to you for a second.</font>

435
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,670
<font color="yellow">You own a big business so you can feed yourself, right?</font>

436
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,799
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

437
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:48,869
<font color="yellow">I think about how much I need to earn to buy a bank.</font>

438
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,940
<font color="yellow">You're going to buy a bank?</font>

439
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,000
<font color="yellow">You buy and sell banks?</font>

440
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:56,640
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

441
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,269
<font color="yellow">While I was living a routine life there,</font>

442
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,339
<font color="yellow">I was always thinking about how to make money.</font>

443
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,539
<font color="yellow">- Where were you? - I was in China.</font>

444
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,400
<font color="yellow">I guess you were living a routine life in China.</font>

445
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,940
<font color="yellow">Yes. I always ate and slept on schedule.</font>

446
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,900
<font color="yellow">Why were you in China?</font>

447
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,039
<font color="yellow">I went there for business.</font>

448
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,440
<font color="yellow">Are you hiding something from me?</font>

449
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,099
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

450
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,470
<font color="yellow">A woman.</font>

451
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:32,099
<font color="yellow">You look neat and earn a lot of money. You must have dated.</font>

452
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,039
<font color="yellow">You could have dated them or lived with them.</font>

453
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:37,400
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

454
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,200
<font color="yellow">There weren't any woman there.</font>

455
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,269
<font color="yellow">There are women everywhere.</font>

456
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:45,900
<font color="yellow">Not everywhere.</font>

457
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,970
<font color="yellow">China is huge, so I guess that's possible.</font>

458
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,569
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about getting back together with Jae Soon?</font>

459
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,099
<font color="yellow">I'll do it for Ddol Ee.</font>

460
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,269
<font color="yellow">Try convincing her, then.</font>

461
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,039
<font color="yellow">She has a lot of resentment, so she's still upset,</font>

462
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,869
<font color="yellow">but it's all up to you.</font>

463
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,869
<font color="yellow">All right, Mother.</font>

464
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,099
<font color="yellow">Sleep at home.</font>

465
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,369
<font color="yellow">Aunt goes crazy when you don't come home.</font>

466
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:16,769
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

467
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,470
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

468
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:26,400
<font color="yellow">Don't come from now on. I'll pay you back as soon as I can.</font>

469
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,599
<font color="yellow">You know I look forward to...</font>

470
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,140
<font color="yellow">inspecting companies I've invested in.</font>

471
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,240
<font color="yellow">I know that's not the only reason.</font>

472
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:34,069
<font color="yellow">Don't be interested in me any more.</font>

473
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,470
<font color="yellow">Why, all of a sudden?</font>

474
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,099
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married.</font>

475
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,500
<font color="yellow">I've heard you say that many times.</font>

476
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,599
<font color="yellow">I'll just pretend like I didn't hear that.</font>

477
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,599
<font color="yellow">Do it again.</font>

478
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:48,799
<font color="yellow">None of this reflects what I asked you to fix.</font>

479
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

480
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,539
<font color="yellow">Don't daydream. Make sure you make no mistakes.</font>

481
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:54,869
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

482
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,700
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married.</font>

483
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:00,900
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

484
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,839
<font color="yellow">I thought I should tell you.</font>

485
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,670
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the wedding invitation once it gets made.</font>

486
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,599
<font color="yellow">Mother, it's Young Ran.</font>

487
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:21,569
<font color="yellow">Is Gab Dol getting married?</font>

488
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,240
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

489
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,799
<font color="yellow">He can't get married without my approval.</font>

490
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,470
<font color="yellow">He said he'll hand out wedding invitations soon.</font>

491
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
<font color="yellow">That won't happen. I know my son.</font>

492
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,400
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll trust you.</font>

493
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,039
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

494
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,170
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why are you back so early?</font>

495
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,539
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take some rest and go for beer delivery.</font>

496
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,869
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo, I'm coming home with 1,000 dollars today.</font>

497
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,970
<font color="yellow">- What do you want? - It's okay.</font>

498
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,569
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

499
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,200
<font color="yellow">Let's buy some good food.</font>

500
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,500
<font color="yellow">Do you want dress shoes?</font>

501
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,500
<font color="yellow">The pair you had got ruined from getting soaked in water.</font>

502
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,369
<font color="yellow">I don't need dress shoes. I have no occasion to wear it.</font>

503
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,440
<font color="yellow">Wait for it. I'll come home with 1,000 dollars.</font>

504
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:39,740
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

505
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,440
<font color="yellow">- It's none of your business. - It's an important meeting.</font>

506
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,500
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo went out with her friends. Tell her to order food.</font>

507
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,799
<font color="yellow">Sure. See you later.</font>

508
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,700
<font color="yellow">I didn't...</font>

509
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:06,970
<font color="yellow">expect to see you here, Sir.</font>

510
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,700
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

511
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,470
<font color="yellow">Professor,</font>

512
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,400
<font color="yellow">thank you.</font>

513
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,769
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

514
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,470
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

515
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,240
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

516
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,670
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

517
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,839
<font color="yellow">This isn't going to change my mind.</font>

518
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,670
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to date you.</font>

519
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,869
<font color="yellow">You begged me to meet you,</font>

520
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,039
<font color="yellow">so I came for the 1,000 dollars.</font>

521
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,500
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do this.</font>

522
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,599
<font color="yellow">Why do you have this?</font>

523
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,799
<font color="yellow">Do you know how precious this is?</font>

524
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,740
<font color="yellow">Why did you steal this?</font>

525
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,140
<font color="yellow">Do you think my son is a thief like you?</font>

526
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,039
<font color="yellow">I thought wrong about you.</font>

527
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:12,769
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

528
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,869
<font color="yellow">Those shoes...</font>

529
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,369
<font color="yellow">are mine.</font>

530
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,299
<font color="yellow">The son you raised...</font>

531
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,700
<font color="yellow">is Si Nae's son.</font>

532
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:08,839
<font color="yellow">My baby.</font>

533
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:11,369
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

534
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,670
<font color="yellow">My baby.</font>

535
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,000
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

536
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:24,099
<font color="yellow">Is something bothering you?</font>

537
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:30,809
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

538
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,369
<font color="yellow">Did Ms Nam tell us to move out?</font>

539
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,099
<font color="yellow">Wait here. I'll talk to her.</font>

540
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:38,000
<font color="yellow">I found your biological mother.</font>

541
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:43,539
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

542
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,369
<font color="yellow">I said I found your biological mother.</font>

543
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,369
<font color="yellow">I thought she passed away.</font>

544
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:51,369
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought,</font>

545
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,269
<font color="yellow">but she turned out to be alive.</font>

546
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,599
<font color="yellow">I'm going to meet her tomorrow.</font>

547
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,099
<font color="yellow">You must be surprised.</font>

548
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,000
<font color="yellow">Still, it's nice that she's alive. You can meet her.</font>

549
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,099
<font color="yellow">Let's go and meet her.</font>

550
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,369
<font color="yellow">Soo Jo.</font>

551
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:43,599
<font color="yellow">- What kind of person is she? - You'll see when you meet her.</font>

552
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,340
<font color="yellow">Your father passed away. She's the only one who's alive.</font>

553
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:50,400
<font color="yellow">Is she not poor?</font>

554
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,170
<font color="yellow">No, you won't have to work to support them.</font>

555
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,739
<font color="yellow">If she's not poor, why did she abandon me?</font>

556
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,699
<font color="yellow">Why don't you ask her yourself?</font>

557
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,500
<font color="yellow">- I don't need to meet her. - You should at least hear her out.</font>

558
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,900
<font color="yellow">I don't need to hear anything.</font>

559
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,900
<font color="yellow">I told you. Even if my parents live next door, I won't see them.</font>

560
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,539
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious?</font>

561
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,739
<font color="yellow">I'm not curious at all.</font>

562
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:17,639
<font color="yellow">She'll just be another human being who's full of excuses.</font>

563
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,340
<font color="yellow">You're the only parent I have.</font>

564
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,400
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about this any more.</font>

565
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,309
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to say this,</font>

566
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,400
<font color="yellow">but my son doesn't want to meet you.</font>

567
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,539
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to him about me?</font>

568
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,699
<font color="yellow">No. I didn't want to make him angry.</font>

569
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,440
<font color="yellow">Then why doesn't he want to meet me?</font>

570
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:52,369
<font color="yellow">He must be confused.</font>

571
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,039
<font color="yellow">He thought his biological mother was dead all this time.</font>

572
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,900
<font color="yellow">Imagine how shocked he would be.</font>

573
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:02,739
<font color="yellow">I can't force him into doing something he doesn't want.</font>

574
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,670
<font color="yellow">I never have until this day.</font>

575
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,869
<font color="yellow">Please, Professor. Please help me meet him.</font>

576
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:10,940
<font color="yellow">Once I meet him, I'll take care of the rest.</font>

577
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,369
<font color="yellow">Can you please convince him?</font>

578
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,699
<font color="yellow">And don't tell him about me.</font>

579
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,199
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

580
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,269
<font color="yellow">What a small world!</font>

581
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,239
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

582
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,170
<font color="yellow">Tell me about it.</font>

583
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:30,900
<font color="yellow">I still can't believe this. I'm still shocked.</font>

584
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,670
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if this is good or bad.</font>

585
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,599
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You just won the lottery!</font>

586
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:42,170
<font color="yellow">Once they take him in, he will inherit all their property.</font>

587
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,869
<font color="yellow">Do Geum, your day has finally come.</font>

588
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,369
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that I'm your friend.</font>

589
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,269
<font color="yellow">I don't plan on taking anything. I'm happy as long as Soo Jo is happy.</font>

590
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,369
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be a burden to him.</font>

591
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,469
<font color="yellow">Stop lying.</font>

592
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,769
<font color="yellow">Go home if you're going to say such things. You punk.</font>

593
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,599
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Soo Jo won't abandon you and live abundantly on his own.</font>

594
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,269
<font color="yellow">That's just ungrateful.</font>

595
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,900
<font color="yellow">Sir, when will I become the director?</font>

596
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,900
<font color="yellow">What? Director?</font>

597
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:24,809
<font color="yellow">Yes, I need to prepare some stuff.</font>

598
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,369
<font color="yellow">I'm also planning to launch several projects.</font>

599
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:30,599
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to get them started once I become the director.</font>

600
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,940
<font color="yellow">- Well... - That's unacceptable.</font>

601
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,400
<font color="yellow">How can you talk about work directly to the chairman?</font>

602
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:40,340
<font color="yellow">Am I just a puppet to you?</font>

603
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,269
<font color="yellow">Are you that desperate to become the director?</font>

604
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,639
<font color="yellow">It's not because I'm desperate.</font>

605
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:48,239
<font color="yellow">I asked because he already mentioned it,</font>

606
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,309
<font color="yellow">and Gong Joo also asked me to ask him.</font>

607
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,840
<font color="yellow">That won't happen.</font>

608
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:53,309
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

609
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,099
<font color="yellow">From now on, anything that has to do with work should be reported to me.</font>

610
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,869
<font color="yellow">There's a lot you can do even if you don't become the director.</font>

611
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,239
<font color="yellow">Man Joo.</font>

612
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,070
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

613
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:30,239
<font color="yellow">I called you. I didn't know you were here.</font>

614
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,309
<font color="yellow">Are you here with someone else?</font>

615
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,699
<font color="yellow">I'm just enjoying time by myself.</font>

616
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,139
<font color="yellow">What a coincidence.</font>

617
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,639
<font color="yellow">Why are you here alone? What about that man?</font>

618
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,039
<font color="yellow">- Who? - The blind date.</font>

619
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,469
<font color="yellow">Did you have a fight?</font>

620
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,539
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to fight over. We only just met.</font>

621
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,500
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer my phone call? I called you several times.</font>

622
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,840
<font color="yellow">I was going to let you off thinking that you're busy.</font>

623
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,070
<font color="yellow">Your wife...</font>

624
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,309
<font color="yellow">came to see me.</font>

625
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,539
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't meet in private.</font>

626
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,840
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave.</font>

627
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,039
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

628
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:17,469
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

629
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,039
<font color="yellow">I'm just...</font>

630
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:23,539
<font color="yellow">selfish.</font>

631
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,699
<font color="yellow">I always did things my way.</font>

632
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,570
<font color="yellow">Even after I got married,</font>

633
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,869
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd always stay by my side.</font>

634
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,099
<font color="yellow">I never held onto you.</font>

635
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:41,969
<font color="yellow">But I never let you go, either.</font>

636
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:47,340
<font color="yellow">I'm being selfish again by saying this.</font>

637
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:50,539
<font color="yellow">You should just...</font>

638
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,239
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything.</font>

639
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,469
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything.</font>

640
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,539
<font color="yellow">Did you drink alcohol?</font>

641
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,500
<font color="yellow">Why would you do something like that?</font>

642
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,869
<font color="yellow">What did you say to Man Joo?</font>

643
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,099
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

644
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,869
<font color="yellow">Did you tell her not to meet me and not to contact me?</font>

645
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:24,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. I have all the right to say that.</font>

646
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:26,840
<font color="yellow">It's not about whether you have a right or not.</font>

647
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:31,469
<font color="yellow">- I'm really disappointed in you. - You're the one who caused this.</font>

648
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,570
<font color="yellow">You two almost got married to each other.</font>

649
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,900
<font color="yellow">You kept seeing her even after you quit working at the hospital.</font>

650
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:39,170
<font color="yellow">You told me that she was just a friend, so I trusted you.</font>

651
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,670
<font color="yellow">You're on your way back from meeting her, aren't you?</font>

652
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:43,699
<font color="yellow">I can smell her perfume on you.</font>

653
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,099
<font color="yellow">Yes, I met her. I accidentally met her at a bar.</font>

654
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:49,099
<font color="yellow">Accidentally?</font>

655
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,539
<font color="yellow">Gong Joo. Let's not do this.</font>

656
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,769
<font color="yellow">I can't do this.</font>

657
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:58,340
<font color="yellow">Man Joo isn't the kind of person you think she is.</font>

658
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
<font color="yellow">Are you taking her side instead of mine?</font>

659
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,769
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm stupid?</font>

660
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,170
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

661
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,869
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? You'll wake your grandfather.</font>

662
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,900
<font color="yellow">Do you even throw things now?</font>

663
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,809
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this because you won't become the director?</font>

664
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,699
<font color="yellow">- I did it. - Why?</font>

665
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,309
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business. It's a problem between us.</font>

666
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,199
<font color="yellow">I want a word with you later.</font>

667
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,469
<font color="yellow">- You're still awake. - Yes. Long time no see.</font>

668
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,900
<font color="yellow">I told you to sleep at home.</font>

669
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,769
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

670
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:05,840
<font color="yellow">What do you think about moving out with your mother?</font>

671
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:09,070
<font color="yellow">I can't live with her.</font>

672
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:11,570
<font color="yellow">Just seeing her face makes me furious.</font>

673
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:15,340
<font color="yellow">How can you ignore her when you're living under the same roof?</font>

674
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,400
<font color="yellow">I can't allow that kind of behaviour in my house.</font>

675
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,940
<font color="yellow">Then I won't ever come here again.</font>

676
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,570
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon.</font>

677
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,539
<font color="yellow">Don't say that to him.</font>

678
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,469
<font color="yellow">He has nowhere to go.</font>

679
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,769
<font color="yellow">If he has to leave, he should leave when it gets warmer.</font>

680
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,139
<font color="yellow">Why don't you two move out and live together?</font>

681
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,539
<font color="yellow">How can you ignore each other like this?</font>

682
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,400
<font color="yellow">Whenever he comes, I'll just stay in my room or something.</font>

683
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:42,570
<font color="yellow">Just let him stay here.</font>

684
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,769
<font color="yellow">Dal Pa, do as I say.</font>

685
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:48,269
<font color="yellow">You can't go out in this cold winter.</font>

686
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:08,239
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

687
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,070
<font color="yellow">I'll meet her.</font>

688
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:13,539
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

689
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,340
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

690
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:17,500
<font color="yellow">He'll meet us.</font>

691
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,369
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

692
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,170
<font color="yellow">I'll take one.</font>

693
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:25,340
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

694
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,099
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

695
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:32,369
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Bye.</font>

696
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,039
<font color="yellow">You want me to cook a meal?</font>

697
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,039
<font color="yellow">Don't ask anything.</font>

698
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,769
<font color="yellow">Please make something for my son.</font>

699
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,269
<font color="yellow">You bought so much.</font>

700
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,769
<font color="yellow">What's the occasion?</font>

701
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:04,840
<font color="yellow">Your son's birthday wasn't too long ago.</font>

702
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,840
<font color="yellow">My son is leaving.</font>

703
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,139
<font color="yellow">I want to...</font>

704
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,500
<font color="yellow">feed him a meal before he leaves.</font>

705
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,199
<font color="yellow">Where is he going?</font>

706
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:18,670
<font color="yellow">Are you sending him off to his real parents?</font>

707
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,469
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

708
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,000
<font color="yellow">I wasn't eavesdropping.</font>

709
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,269
<font color="yellow">I just heard you telling him that you found his real mum.</font>

710
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,969
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

711
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,369
<font color="yellow">I'm going to send him back to his mother.</font>

712
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:36,099
<font color="yellow">What is she like?</font>

713
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,369
<font color="yellow">Is she well off?</font>

714
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:43,840
<font color="yellow">I guess not, since she couldn't raise her own child.</font>

715
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:45,969
<font color="yellow">Did he say he'll go to her?</font>

716
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:48,639
<font color="yellow">I'll send him away even if he says no.</font>

717
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:51,000
<font color="yellow">Since when did you raise him?</font>

718
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,170
<font color="yellow">Since when he was a baby.</font>

719
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,269
<font color="yellow">You must've been through a lot.</font>

720
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:59,739
<font color="yellow">You raised him all this time. How will you send him away?</font>

721
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:03,599
<font color="yellow">I thought it was strange because you two didn't look alike.</font>

722
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,199
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you're so great.</font>

723
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:10,670
<font color="yellow">I just thought your wife passed away early.</font>

724
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:15,639
<font color="yellow">How did you raise him alone like he was your own child?</font>

725
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:17,400
<font color="yellow">We both cried a lot.</font>

726
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,300
<font color="yellow">You'll never know what we went through.</font>

727
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,969
<font color="yellow">I can only imagine the kind of hardships you would've gone through.</font>

728
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:25,570
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry for you.</font>

729
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,170
<font color="yellow">Some people even abandon their own children.</font>

730
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,340
<font color="yellow">How will you live on your own? You'll be so lonely.</font>

731
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:38,739
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

732
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,340
<font color="yellow">What will do you?</font>

733
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,469
<font color="yellow">I'll move out.</font>

734
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:48,300
<font color="yellow">Will you go with him?</font>

735
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,639
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

736
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,300
<font color="yellow">I'll go somewhere else.</font>

737
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,170
<font color="yellow">Don't tell my son.</font>

738
00:46:55,469 --> 00:46:57,539
<font color="yellow">I don't talk with him anyway.</font>

739
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,900
<font color="yellow">- Will it take long? - It's almost done.</font>

740
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:06,639
<font color="yellow">Must you make kalguksu?</font>

741
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,739
<font color="yellow">When he puts his mind to it, he has to go through with it.</font>

742
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:12,840
<font color="yellow">He was upset last time because he couldn't have kalguksu.</font>

743
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,199
<font color="yellow">Just leave him be.</font>

744
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:17,170
<font color="yellow">Put your mind to something else, not just food.</font>

745
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,769
<font color="yellow">Don't bother me.</font>

746
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,739
<font color="yellow">We agreed to use the kitchen at a set time.</font>

747
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,269
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many times I had to go eat cup noodles?</font>

748
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,739
<font color="yellow">Wait. Let's eat together today.</font>

749
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,139
<font color="yellow">It's my treat.</font>

750
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:34,670
<font color="yellow">He'll share. Just wait.</font>

751
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,599
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon, the broth is boiling.</font>

752
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,039
<font color="yellow">What's next?</font>

753
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,170
<font color="yellow">You have to put those in.</font>

754
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,500
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

755
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:43,739
<font color="yellow">Put those in.</font>

756
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,300
<font color="yellow">How is it? Isn't it good?</font>

757
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,800
<font color="yellow">Yes. You should open a restaurant.</font>

758
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:58,199
<font color="yellow">Shall I?</font>

759
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,570
<font color="yellow">It's perfect.</font>

760
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:01,139
<font color="yellow">The noodles turned out well.</font>

761
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,440
<font color="yellow">It's delicious, Dad.</font>

762
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:05,800
<font color="yellow">By the way, I keep biting something weird.</font>

763
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,369
<font color="yellow">I don't think there's anything.</font>

764
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,670
<font color="yellow">Joong Nyeon. There's something.</font>

765
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,039
<font color="yellow">There's something weird.</font>

766
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:15,440
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

767
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:17,170
<font color="yellow">Was there something in the flour?</font>

768
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:20,769
<font color="yellow">I used the flour that I spilled last time.</font>

769
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:22,039
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

770
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,400
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to eat this.</font>

771
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,300
<font color="yellow">I don't feel so good.</font>

772
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:33,369
<font color="yellow">Dad, you can't use that flour. I'll get you a new bag of flour.</font>

773
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,269
<font color="yellow">I guess I can't have kalguksu today.</font>

774
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,670
<font color="yellow">(800 dollars has been deposited.)</font>

775
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:56,940
<font color="yellow">I just sent you 800 dollars for child support.</font>

776
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:07,199
<font color="yellow">(Available for rent)</font>

777
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:21,139
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you in a while.</font>

778
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,139
<font color="yellow">How did you know about this place?</font>

779
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,969
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

780
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,269
<font color="yellow">How could you cut off all contacts?</font>

781
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,139
<font color="yellow">Were you keeping in touch with my daughter?</font>

782
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,769
<font color="yellow">Are you saying the three of you ran into each other at her restaurant?</font>

783
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:46,469
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it was her restaurant.</font>

784
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:49,300
<font color="yellow">The restaurant was a mess. I guess she fought with customers.</font>

785
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,699
<font color="yellow">Now I understand.</font>

786
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she got furious after you saw her like that.</font>

787
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,239
<font color="yellow">That's why she closed the restaurant.</font>

788
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:01,199
<font color="yellow">She must've been so upset.</font>

789
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,070
<font color="yellow">Are you seeing that woman again?</font>

790
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,869
<font color="yellow">How could you keep the kids from contacting us though?</font>

791
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:09,539
<font color="yellow">That's not what I intended.</font>

792
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,239
<font color="yellow">I'm not doing well in many ways.</font>

793
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,940
<font color="yellow">Why did you come to her restaurant?</font>

794
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:21,099
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

795
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:24,170
<font color="yellow">- What is this? - Cho Rong's mum...</font>

796
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,239
<font color="yellow">sent me child support.</font>

797
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,570
<font color="yellow">I can't accept this. Please give it back to her.</font>

798
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,869
<font color="yellow">She sent it to you as a mother. Use it for the children.</font>

799
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,300
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

800
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,070
<font color="yellow">She started working so she could earn money for the kids.</font>

801
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,570
<font color="yellow">Where did she...</font>

802
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,300
<font color="yellow">get the money to open a restaurant?</font>

803
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,199
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. She didn't get a private loan.</font>

804
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:46,469
<font color="yellow">Tell her not to work if she's working because of the kids.</font>

805
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,099
<font color="yellow">Why did she have to start a business that involves alcohol?</font>

806
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:51,070
<font color="yellow">It's not an easy job.</font>

807
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,070
<font color="yellow">It looked like she had a fight with the customers that day, too.</font>

808
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,139
<font color="yellow">A woman can't do it alone.</font>

809
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,139
<font color="yellow">She has no choice. She needs to earn money.</font>

810
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,670
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business if you can't help her.</font>

811
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,570
<font color="yellow">She has to learn for herself.</font>

812
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,400
<font color="yellow">Where did you move to?</font>

813
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,570
<font color="yellow">Are the kids doing okay?</font>

814
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,670
<font color="yellow">They don't call, and they don't even answer my calls.</font>

815
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,869
<font color="yellow">I know they're young,</font>

816
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,940
<font color="yellow">but I'm still very upset.</font>

817
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,699
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

818
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,340
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

819
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:22,840
<font color="yellow">tell her never to send money again.</font>

820
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,300
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one thing.</font>

821
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,070
<font color="yellow">You said you turned...</font>

822
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,000
<font color="yellow">the steering wheel to protect my daughter.</font>

823
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,599
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

824
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:37,199
<font color="yellow">Because she's the mother of my kids.</font>

825
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,570
<font color="yellow">Really? Okay.</font>

826
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:56,869
<font color="yellow">I'll send Jae Soon right away.</font>

827
00:51:58,769 --> 00:52:01,199
<font color="yellow">Hey. Get changed...</font>

828
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,239
<font color="yellow">and go to the restaurant near the intersection.</font>

829
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,570
<font color="yellow">Se Bang is there with Ddol Ee.</font>

830
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,039
<font color="yellow">He must be crazy.</font>

831
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:09,500
<font color="yellow">He's not crazy.</font>

832
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,070
<font color="yellow">He just wants to buy Ddol Ee something delicious.</font>

833
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,500
<font color="yellow">- You should go. - That jerk.</font>

834
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:18,199
<font color="yellow">I should get changed, too.</font>

835
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:22,369
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're so slow-witted.</font>

836
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,699
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, I'm slow-witted?</font>

837
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:29,469
<font color="yellow">How can I be slow-witted when I'm a shaman?</font>

838
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,539
<font color="yellow">I've never heard anyone say that to me.</font>

839
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,500
<font color="yellow">Let them have dinner together as a family.</font>

840
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,769
<font color="yellow">Am I not family?</font>

841
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,840
<font color="yellow">I mean just the three of them.</font>

842
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,199
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

843
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,840
<font color="yellow">Take your time eating and talk to him.</font>

844
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,969
<font color="yellow">That won't happen.</font>

845
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,199
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like it.</font>

846
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,039
<font color="yellow">You should care about your child's feelings.</font>

847
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,469
<font color="yellow">It's nice to have a family dinner, isn't it?</font>

848
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,340
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee must've been envious of other kids.</font>

849
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,400
<font color="yellow">People live together for their children.</font>

850
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,599
<font color="yellow">I'll pick Ddol Ee up and come right back.</font>

851
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:09,969
<font color="yellow">She'll have dinner.</font>

852
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:12,369
<font color="yellow">Is your shamanistic power back?</font>

853
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,269
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

854
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:25,670
<font color="yellow">Hi, this is Jo Geum Sik.</font>

855
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:28,599
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

856
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:30,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

857
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:41,699
<font color="yellow">- Honey! - Mum!</font>

858
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:45,170
<font color="yellow">- Ddol Ee, let's go. - Don't do this.</font>

859
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:46,670
<font color="yellow">We already ordered.</font>

860
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,599
<font color="yellow">- Ddol Ee, let's eat together. - Okay.</font>

861
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,269
<font color="yellow">Mum, can I eat before we go?</font>

862
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:54,300
<font color="yellow">Of course you can.</font>

863
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing without telling me first?</font>

864
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:00,670
<font color="yellow">Your anger is making me aroused.</font>

865
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,570
<font color="yellow">He's listening.</font>

866
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,840
<font color="yellow">Who cares? A couple can talk about such things.</font>

867
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:09,239
<font color="yellow">They say kids respond positively when their parents get along.</font>

868
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,639
<font color="yellow">Mum, Dad bought this for me. It's so nice.</font>

869
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,440
<font color="yellow">Am I not the best dad in the world?</font>

870
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,070
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat. - Mum, sit down.</font>

871
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:28,239
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

872
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,000
<font color="yellow">Mum, it's delicious.</font>

873
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,400
<font color="yellow">Let's eat here often from now on, Ddol Ee.</font>

874
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,599
<font color="yellow">This is for you, Ddol Ee.</font>

875
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,769
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

876
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,199
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee is watching.</font>

877
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,000
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm putting up with this.</font>

878
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,639
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I would have smacked this plate on your face.</font>

879
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:17,670
<font color="yellow">It's my fault. I'm the one who made you become so callous.</font>

880
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,900
<font color="yellow">However, you being like this...</font>

881
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,039
<font color="yellow">Just shut it and eat.</font>

882
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,800
<font color="yellow">I'm only here because of Ddol Ee.</font>

883
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,840
<font color="yellow">Does it make you feel better if you act that way?</font>

884
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:29,039
<font color="yellow">Women are all the same.</font>

885
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,769
<font color="yellow">If you were like this before, I wouldn't have divorced you.</font>

886
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,300
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who filed for divorce.</font>

887
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,769
<font color="yellow">You got divorced by me. Don't be arrogant.</font>

888
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,869
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, let's take a picture together.</font>

889
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,440
<font color="yellow">Let me be in it, too.</font>

890
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,940
<font color="yellow">Smile.</font>

891
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,170
<font color="yellow">(Where are you?)</font>

892
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:13,199
<font color="yellow">(Where are you?)</font>

893
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,440
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

894
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:18,969
<font color="yellow">Who is it from?</font>

895
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,969
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business.</font>

896
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,440
<font color="yellow">Let's go now.</font>

897
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:26,000
<font color="yellow">Who sent the message? Why are you in such a hurry?</font>

898
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,170
<font color="yellow">I'm your husband, remember?</font>

899
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,239
<font color="yellow">Shut up. Do you still think I'm your wife?</font>

900
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:34,599
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee, let's go now.</font>

901
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,300
<font color="yellow">(Jae Soon)</font>

902
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,300
<font color="yellow">Don't ever meet her again.</font>

903
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,000
<font color="yellow">Have you no conscience?</font>

904
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,969
<font color="yellow">(Where are you?)</font>

905
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,000
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting in front of your place.</font>

906
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,440
<font color="yellow">Bye, Ddol Ee. Call me.</font>

907
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:23,239
<font color="yellow">Bye, Dad.</font>

908
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,400
<font color="yellow">- Mr Kim. - Yes, Sir.</font>

909
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:32,699
<font color="yellow">It's a gift.</font>

910
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,400
<font color="yellow">I don't want it.</font>

911
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,300
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

912
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,739
<font color="yellow">Take it inside.</font>

913
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,070
<font color="yellow">Tell me honestly.</font>

914
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,900
<font color="yellow">Why are you seeing her even after you got divorced?</font>

915
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,099
<font color="yellow">You two aren't teenagers.</font>

916
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,400
<font color="yellow">You both have children.</font>

917
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,539
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't meet frivolously.</font>

918
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:24,570
<font color="yellow">Is this a game? How long will this last?</font>

919
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,840
<font color="yellow">You may not have much to lose,</font>

920
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,269
<font color="yellow">but my daughter has to be careful...</font>

921
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,170
<font color="yellow">about whom she meets from now on.</font>

922
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,170
<font color="yellow">She can no longer be dating for fun.</font>

923
00:58:37,699 --> 00:58:40,969
<font color="yellow">I can't bear to watch her being like that as a parent.</font>

924
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:43,699
<font color="yellow">You are not in a good financial situation, either.</font>

925
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,300
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I don't want my daughter to suffer in poverty.</font>

926
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:49,039
<font color="yellow">I am aware of that.</font>

927
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:51,070
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

928
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:53,070
<font color="yellow">You can't ignore reality.</font>

929
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,900
<font color="yellow">Do you expect the entire family to live in that tiny place?</font>

930
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,869
<font color="yellow">Don't you try to toy with her emotions.</font>

931
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,099
<font color="yellow">It seems like you're seeing her...</font>

932
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:06,869
<font color="yellow">without any kind of commitment.</font>

933
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,869
<font color="yellow">You both shouldn't behave that way.</font>

934
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
<font color="yellow">I may not know your true intentions,</font>

935
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:13,440
<font color="yellow">but I know Jae Soon very well.</font>

936
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:18,170
<font color="yellow">She gets swayed easily by other people.</font>

937
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:20,269
<font color="yellow">She doesn't realise that she's falling into a trap.</font>

938
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:23,269
<font color="yellow">I can't let her work at a supermarket all her life.</font>

939
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:26,369
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can leave her a large inheritance, either.</font>

940
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,440
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let her remarry...</font>

941
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,900
<font color="yellow">Ddol Ee's father?</font>

942
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,070
<font color="yellow">Let her go now.</font>

943
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:37,570
<font color="yellow">That's all I ask of you.</font>

944
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,369
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but that's what I want.</font>

945
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:43,440
<font color="yellow">I understand what you're saying.</font>

946
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,670
<font color="yellow">I don't want Jae Soon to suffer, either.</font>

947
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,070
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

948
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:54,769
<font color="yellow">- My goodness! - Try it on.</font>

949
00:59:54,769 --> 00:59:57,340
<font color="yellow">If you don't want it, let me have it.</font>

950
00:59:57,369 --> 00:59:59,570
<font color="yellow">It won't fit you. It might fit me, though.</font>

951
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,739
<font color="yellow">You are so greedy.</font>

952
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,800
<font color="yellow">Don't touch it. I will return it to him.</font>

953
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:06,400
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

954
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:13,400
<font color="yellow">- Let me try it on. - Let me.</font>

955
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:15,800
<font color="yellow">Be careful. You will rip it.</font>

956
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,099
<font color="yellow">- No way. - I think you just ripped it.</font>

957
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:23,739
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

958
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:26,500
<font color="yellow">We agreed to not disclose everything.</font>

959
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,769
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that we're just living together.</font>

960
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:32,400
<font color="yellow">Thanks for reminding me.</font>

961
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:36,000
<font color="yellow">Se Bang wanted to take the whole family out for a meal,</font>

962
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,570
<font color="yellow">but I sent them out by themselves since you weren't here.</font>

963
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,340
<font color="yellow">Since when was he our family?</font>

964
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:44,670
<font color="yellow">Why can't he be?</font>

965
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:49,199
<font color="yellow">He bought Jae Soon a mink coat.</font>

966
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:53,869
<font color="yellow">So did she fall for him because of that?</font>

967
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:56,500
<font color="yellow">She didn't even try it on.</font>

968
01:00:57,369 --> 01:01:00,139
<font color="yellow">Why are you so against Se Bang?</font>

969
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,800
<font color="yellow">His business is doing well, and he has no other woman.</font>

970
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:04,599
<font color="yellow">I already told you no.</font>

971
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,940
<font color="yellow">Why can't you tell me the reason?</font>

972
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,000
<font color="yellow">They had their chances. Why do you want them back together again?</font>

973
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,440
<font color="yellow">He is Ddol Ee's father. He has better prospects than Mr Jo.</font>

974
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:16,170
<font color="yellow">I don't like either of them.</font>

975
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,340
<font color="yellow">Why didn't Jae Soon get a job after graduating from college?</font>

976
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:25,139
<font color="yellow">She has to be dependent on men because she isn't independent.</font>

977
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

978
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,099
<font color="yellow">In that sense, Gab Soon is much better.</font>

979
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,800
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous. She's so crazy about getting married.</font>

980
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:36,469
<font color="yellow">Our daughters are both worthless.</font>

981
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,099
<font color="yellow">You are so stubborn.</font>

982
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:42,099
<font color="yellow">Are you really going through with it?</font>

983
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:44,369
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

984
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:48,699
<font color="yellow">What about you? Mum and Dad are so worried.</font>

985
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,699
<font color="yellow">- Are you seeing him? - Who?</font>

986
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:53,469
<font color="yellow">Cho Rong's dad.</font>

987
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,769
<font color="yellow">We're just friends.</font>

988
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:58,170
<font color="yellow">I don't know how he feels.</font>

989
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,239
<font color="yellow">It seems like he's still seeing his ex-wife.</font>

990
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,840
<font color="yellow">I don't know if he wants to get back with her.</font>

991
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:05,699
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear anything about that.</font>

992
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:08,940
<font color="yellow">Gab Dol would have told me if something like that was happening.</font>

993
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,469
<font color="yellow">I saw him meeting Ms Nam.</font>

994
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:15,269
<font color="yellow">He might still be supporting her. I saw him giving her an envelope.</font>

995
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:18,099
<font color="yellow">No way. He's still doing that?</font>

996
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,170
<font color="yellow">When I saw him doing that, my feelings for him waned.</font>

997
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,239
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'm jealous.</font>

998
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:29,440
<font color="yellow">I keep wondering if he still has feelings for his ex-wife.</font>

999
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:31,969
<font color="yellow">I wonder how he feels about me.</font>

1000
01:02:33,099 --> 01:02:35,599
<font color="yellow">I felt this sad feeling in my heart.</font>

1001
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:38,599
<font color="yellow">Perhaps that kind of woke me up.</font>

1002
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:43,170
<font color="yellow">I realise that he just might not be my man.</font>

1003
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:46,440
<font color="yellow">I think I know how you feel.</font>

1004
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,739
<font color="yellow">Women's feelings can be swayed by such little things.</font>

1005
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,500
<font color="yellow">One word or a single facial expression can change things.</font>

1006
01:02:55,269 --> 01:02:56,300
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

1007
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,699
<font color="yellow">What about your first husband, Ddol Ee's father?</font>

1008
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,039
<font color="yellow">Mum seems to want him back as your husband.</font>

1009
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,639
<font color="yellow">I also think that's a good idea.</font>

1010
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:10,940
<font color="yellow">He might be the best option since he is Ddol Ee's father.</font>

1011
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:13,469
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'm saying this without knowing how you feel.</font>

1012
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:15,699
<font color="yellow">Your feelings are the most important factor.</font>

1013
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:22,539
<font color="yellow">Mr Geum Do Geum. You have a package.</font>

1014
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,139
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1015
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,539
<font color="yellow">I told you that we should meet at a cafe.</font>

1016
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:00,639
<font color="yellow">Let's not meet outside any more.</font>

1017
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,800
<font color="yellow">We should save money. Why waste money on coffee?</font>

1018
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,400
<font color="yellow">Let's go buy gifts.</font>

1019
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:08,000
<font color="yellow">Gifts are not important right now. Follow me.</font>

1020
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,869
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

1021
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,969
<font color="yellow">We should go to a nice place on a day like today.</font>

1022
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,039
<font color="yellow">We're going to a nice place.</font>

1023
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,099
<font color="yellow">What are we doing at my house?</font>

1024
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,139
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

1025
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:24,739
<font color="yellow">By myself?</font>

1026
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:27,000
<font color="yellow">You should spend time with your mum on a day like today.</font>

1027
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,670
<font color="yellow">I got some delicious food for you.</font>

1028
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,199
<font color="yellow">I have a big family, so they don't notice even when I'm not around,</font>

1029
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,940
<font color="yellow">but it's not like that for you. Especially with your sister gone.</font>

1030
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,400
<font color="yellow">Don't make your mum feel lonely.</font>

1031
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:39,769
<font color="yellow">Then let's go in together.</font>

1032
01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:41,469
<font color="yellow">Do you want another battle?</font>

1033
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:45,269
<font color="yellow">I have no strength because I cleaned all day. Go in and make her happy.</font>

1034
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,599
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

1035
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,070
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

1036
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:21,469
<font color="yellow">Bye, Ddol Ee. Call me.</font>

1037
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,300
<font color="yellow">Bye, Dad.</font>

1038
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,969
<font color="yellow">(Where are you?)</font>

1039
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:39,869
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

1040
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:48,940
<font color="yellow">It's late.</font>

1041
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,400
<font color="yellow">Come out. I'm in front of your place.</font>

1042
01:05:55,969 --> 01:05:57,599
<font color="yellow">I have to see you tonight.</font>

1043
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,969
<font color="yellow">Why are you here so late?</font>

1044
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,469
<font color="yellow">I got a gift for you.</font>

1045
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:17,469
<font color="yellow">It's a toy for Ddol Ee and something for you.</font>

1046
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,539
<font color="yellow">Please take it even if you don't like it.</font>

1047
01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:24,800
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything for you.</font>

1048
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:27,369
<font color="yellow">Can we go someplace warm?</font>

1049
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,900
<font color="yellow">I sneaked out, so I have to get back in...</font>

1050
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,340
<font color="yellow">before my mother notices.</font>

1051
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,940
<font color="yellow">This may not seem appropriate,</font>

1052
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:38,440
<font color="yellow">but I'd better say it.</font>

1053
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:41,070
<font color="yellow">That might be good for you, too.</font>

1054
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:45,900
<font color="yellow">Let's not see each other any more.</font>

1055
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,869
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we both have a lot to say,</font>

1056
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:55,800

<font color="yellow">(Our Gab Soon)</font>

1058
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,639
<font color="yellow">I'm not seeing him any more.</font>

1059
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,039
<font color="yellow">Are you with my husband?</font>

1060
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:32,340
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm with her. Why are you so suspicious?</font>

1061
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:34,199
<font color="yellow">Is Jae Soon still seeing her ex-husband?</font>

1062
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,769
<font color="yellow">You got divorced. You don't need to see her any more.</font>

1063
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:38,500
<font color="yellow">I don't think that's any of your business.</font>

1064
01:07:38,699 --> 01:07:40,670
<font color="yellow">Mr Jo, do not wreck our family.</font>

1065
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,599
<font color="yellow">Please send him to our house no matter what it takes.</font>

1066
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:46,599
<font color="yellow">Do Geum, you sure are doing well now that you sold off your son.</font>

1067
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:48,070
<font color="yellow">Sold off my son? Take that back.</font>

1068
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:51,039
<font color="yellow">We are going to live together since you won't approve our marriage.</font>

1069
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,469
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is acceptable?</font>

1070
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,369
<font color="yellow">Instead of a wedding, we're going to have a small gathering with friends.</font>

1071
01:07:55,469 --> 01:07:57,340
<font color="yellow">Get out! Get out now!</font>
