you were me, so it's my fault.</font>

62
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:46,380
<font color="yellow">To be honest, while I was being held as
an hostage, I heard something strange.</font>

63
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,710
<font color="yellow"><i>What about the kid? Should
I take her to that person?</i></font>

<font color="yellow">"Person"?</font>

66
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,340
<font color="yellow">They definitely said "that person."</font>

67
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,090
<font color="yellow">Do you have any suspicions?</font>

68
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,830
<font color="yellow">No... None at all.</font>

69
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,040
<font color="yellow">About this issue, I think the
headmaster is suspicious.</font>

70
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,770
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

71
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,910
<font color="yellow">Just like the exams, the field trip
was a mission. Chi Ang was injured.</font>

72
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,810
<font color="yellow">And who is Chi Ang? He's the
son of the school's sponsor.</font>

73
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,470
<font color="yellow">So because the problem might get bigger,
they are trying to blame someone else?</font>

74
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,860
<font color="yellow">There you go!</font>

75
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,440
<font color="yellow">If the sponsorship is gone,
there is no more Moorim,</font>

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,040
<font color="yellow">they are trying their best
to cover this problem-</font>

77
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,180
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

78
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,520
<font color="yellow">Yeah, the headmaster is not such a coward?</font>

79
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,170
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why does that make no sense?
Yeop Jeong, what do you think?</font>

80
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,700
<font color="yellow">Stop making assumptions. Why don't you
use this time to practice instead?</font>

81
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,480
<font color="yellow">Have you already forgotten
what happened to you?</font>

82
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,190
<font color="yellow">The school is in chaos!
Can I even practice?</font>

83
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,380
<font color="yellow">You have been in Moorim Institute for 3
years, you can't even handle those jerks.</font>

84
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,850
<font color="yellow">He's starting again.</font>

85
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,780
<font color="yellow">Didn't you enter Moorim because you
didn't want to be bullied anymore?</font>

86
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,370
<font color="yellow">But then, what changed
between then and now?</font>

87
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,130
<font color="yellow">Back then I... didn't want any trouble...</font>

88
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you are embarrassed.</font>

89
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,229
<font color="yellow">While letting them see how
you have not changed being</font>

90
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,450
<font color="yellow">weak and useless and letting
us find out about your past.</font>

91
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,850
<font color="yellow">Me too, I would be embarrassed.</font>

92
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,280
<font color="yellow">Hey! Yeop Jeong!</font>

93
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,540
<font color="yellow">Anyway, amateurs like you won't
even think about such things.</font>

94
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,510
<font color="yellow">Ahoo, this jerk.</font>

95
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,790
<font color="yellow">Yeob Jung was dissing
you, but I sure am upset.</font>

96
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,750
<font color="yellow"><i>What are those? Aren't those Seon Ah's?</i></font>

97
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,478
<font color="yellow"><i>Seon Ah received the order
from the headmaster</i></font>

98
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,230
<font color="yellow"><i>not to leave, so I'm
pretending to be Seon Ah.</i></font>

99
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,790
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you know who it could be?</i></font>

100
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,540
<font color="yellow"><i>They definitely talked about "that person".</i></font>

101
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,040
<font color="yellow">Moorim is facing a serious situation.</font>

102
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,150
<font color="yellow">A board meeting will surely start soon.</font>

103
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,630
<font color="yellow">Prof. Beop Gong, the only people who
knew that the kids left school,</font>

104
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,280
<font color="yellow">are me, the teachers, the students,</font>

105
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,220
<font color="yellow">and Chairman Wang Hao sponsoring us.</font>

106
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,080
<font color="yellow">The culprit has to be one of these people.</font>

107
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,540
<font color="yellow">But rather than asking who did this,</font>

108
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,010
<font color="yellow">I'd rather first ask myself why.</font>

109
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,090
<font color="yellow">If, perhaps, you share my perspective,</font>

110
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,810
<font color="yellow">won't you think this would
lead to the solution faster?</font>

111
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,020
<font color="yellow">I do not want to suspect
anyone from Moorim.</font>

112
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,220
<font color="yellow">Sometimes an enemy</font>

113
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,600
<font color="yellow">can hide in a very close place.</font>

114
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,010
<font color="yellow">Just like how eighteen years ago,</font>

115
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,730
<font color="yellow">when Chae Yoon's family was attacked,</font>

116
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,570
<font color="yellow">some people were suspecting you
were part of the destructive force.</font>

117
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,510
<font color="yellow">But I believed you until
this day, and here we are.</font>

118
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,220
<font color="yellow">That has not changed.</font>

119
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,860
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

120
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,330
<font color="yellow">I do have some unresolved suspicions</font>

121
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,340

122
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,950

tell me when the time would be right.</b></font>

124
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,620
<font color="yellow">As you have said,</font>

125
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,960
<font color="yellow">the enemy might be in the closest spot.</font>

126
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,910
<font color="yellow">Please find out more details
about Chairman Wang Hao.</font>

127
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,890
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

128
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,490
<font color="yellow">Oh, are you up?</font>

129
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,480
<font color="yellow">I stayed up all night nursing you.</font>

130
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,630
<font color="yellow">How is it? Pretty right?</font>

131
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,440
<font color="yellow">It is pretty.</font>

132
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,360
<font color="yellow">Si Woo just called. He
asked if you were okay.</font>

133
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,860
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

<font color="yellow">My head and ears hurt like

showed up and healed me.</font>

349
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,010
<font color="yellow">Just like you did.</font>

350
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,190
<font color="yellow">I asked him if he
was from the Moorim.</font>

351
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:06,970
<font color="yellow">Association, but even
before hearing the answer,</font>

352
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,160
<font color="yellow">he disappeared.</font>

353
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,630
<font color="yellow">Could he have a part in all this incident?</font>

354
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:19,550
<font color="yellow">Can you describe what he looked like?</font>

355
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,920
<font color="yellow">What is wrong?</font>

356
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,880
<font color="yellow">I went to find the Moorim School, but
I couldn't even locate the barrier.</font>

357
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,210
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

358
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,440
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who was looking for me?</font>

359
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,920
<font color="yellow">I'll get back to you.</font>

360
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:12,150
<font color="yellow">Eighteen years ago... oh, when
the Moorim successor died.</font>

361
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,150
<font color="yellow">I heard that back then, Guh
Ji was involved in this.</font>

362
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,969
<font color="yellow">That is true. But those
involved in the affair</font>

363
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,510
<font color="yellow">were obliterated by the
destructive force,</font>

364
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,810
<font color="yellow">the 5 other members left,
fearing for their lives.</font>

365
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:31,280
<font color="yellow">You know them and how they love to talk.</font>

366
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,152
<font color="yellow">Does anyone from those
who are now scattered</font>

367
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:38,530
<font color="yellow">know more about the
incident in detail?</font>

368
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:42,570
<font color="yellow">Now that I think of it, there is this man.</font>

369
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,154
<font color="yellow">I don't know much about
him, but there is someone</font>

370
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,330
<font color="yellow">who was watching everything
from a distance.</font>

371
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,720
<font color="yellow">Soon Deok's mother...</font>

372
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,950
<font color="yellow">How can you leave your
kid with someone else?</font>

373
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,570
<font color="yellow">What will you solve by drinking all day?</font>

374
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,710
<font color="yellow">Just give me more drinks!</font>

375
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,490
<font color="yellow">It's been ten days since your wife died.</font>

376
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,320
<font color="yellow">You should think of Soon Deok
and get back on your feet.</font>

377
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,580
<font color="yellow">There come these guys again.
What do you want?</font>

378
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,840
<font color="yellow">We'll just have the usual.</font>

379
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,730
<font color="yellow">By the way, why is the destructive
force gathering its people?</font>

380
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,400
<font color="yellow">So what, huh? We'll just go
with the flow and make money.</font>

381
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,400
<font color="yellow">If it goes well, they're
giving so much money.</font>

382
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,850
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, go well?</font>

383
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,220
<font color="yellow">I hear they want to steal
the key to Cheon Ui Joo.</font>

384
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,190
<font color="yellow">Cheon Ui Joo? What's that?</font>

385
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,240
<font color="yellow">If you have that, you gain all
the strength in the world.</font>

386
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,680
<font color="yellow">What kind of nonsense is that?</font>

387
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,900
<font color="yellow">It's true!</font>

388
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,200
<font color="yellow">There has always been
earthquakes, plagues, flooding,</font>

389
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,200
<font color="yellow">a lot of people suffered a painful death.</font>

390
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,500
<font color="yellow">It's all because of the
owner of Cheon Ui Joo.</font>

391
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,660
<font color="yellow">After getting it, I've heard people</font>

392
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,120
<font color="yellow">can become invincible or even immortal.</font>

393
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,700
<font color="yellow">Should we just sneak and take it?</font>

394
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,660
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you think they're so easy?</font>

395
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,650
<font color="yellow">But the one from Moorim who has
it shouldn't be easy either...</font>

396
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,840
<font color="yellow">Cheon Ui Joo?</font>

397
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

398
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,060
<font color="yellow">What are they doing?</font>

399
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:58,380
<font color="yellow">What do they want to do with the Cheon
Ui Joo? I should just go home...</font>

Deok will never have to suffer.</font>

<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

403
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,790
<font color="yellow">Where's the Cheon Ui Joo?</font>

404
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,190
<font color="yellow">Look around.</font>

405
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,780

406
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:01,400

But it's only a part.</font>

407
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,000

469
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,620
<font color="yellow">Once upon a time,</font>

470
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,580
<font color="yellow">like, in the eighteenth century,</font>

471
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,420
<font color="yellow">there was this German guy called Schumann.</font>

472
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,720
<font color="yellow">- What kind of a story is this? <b>
- Will you listen or not?</b></font>

473
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,500
<font color="yellow">That guy got a story book from
his dad when he was little.</font>

474
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,500
<font color="yellow">A story about a golden treasure
which burned in a fire.</font>

475
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,980
<font color="yellow">The kid actually thought
the treasure was real</font>

476
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,540
<font color="yellow">and promised himself he'd find it one day.</font>

477
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,450
<font color="yellow"><i>It was only a short while, but.</i></font>

478
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:35,510
<font color="yellow"><i>That man's eyes looked very sad.</i></font>

479
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,300
<font color="yellow">Have you looked into it?</font>

480
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,780
<font color="yellow">Yes. There's nothing on the records
of our ONP Holding building.</font>

481
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,570
<font color="yellow">That can't be. I clearly remember it.</font>

482
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,750
<font color="yellow">You must have been mistaken.</font>

483
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,650
<font color="yellow">But why are you asking?</font>

484
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,280
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I must have
really been mistaken.</font>

485
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Secretary Jang.</font>

486
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,740
<font color="yellow"><i>When he grew up, he became
a very rich businessman.</i></font>

487
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,320
<font color="yellow">He wanted to see the world that
he imagined in that story,</font>

488
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,920
<font color="yellow">and decided to go find the treasure.</font>

489
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,000
<font color="yellow">He held on to that even as an adult? Jesus.</font>

490
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,840
<font color="yellow">They all said he was crazy.</font>

491
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,860
<font color="yellow">That it was just an
absurd, fictional story.</font>

492
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,940
<font color="yellow">But then? Did he really find it?</font>

493
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,060
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

494
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,980
<font color="yellow">There really was a golden treasure?</font>

495
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,940
<font color="yellow">No one had seen it in real life.</font>

496
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,800
<font color="yellow">They all thought it was just
a legend, but he found it.</font>

497
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,850
<font color="yellow">A golden crown, golden chalices, etcetera.</font>

498
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,850
<font color="yellow">All the things you'd
like too, in abundance.</font>

499
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,140
<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense.</font>

500
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,620
<font color="yellow">What doesn't make sense?</font>

501
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,310
<font color="yellow">The thing Schumann found and
now the whole world knows</font>

502
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,290
<font color="yellow">are Trojan artfacts.</font>

503

Heinrich Schliemann?</font>

00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,930
<font color="yellow">Does it make sense that <b>the Chairman's
daughter doesn't know about it?</b></font>

585
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,990
<font color="yellow">All this time weren't you working how
to take over the Chairman's place?</font>

586
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,610
<font color="yellow">That's right. Weren't you going
to become the successor?</font>

587
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:54,960
<font color="yellow">It's not that. I just...</font>

588
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,230
<font color="yellow">You're really pathetic.</font>

589
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,830
<font color="yellow">What about you? Have you known
all about the Cheon Ui Joo?</font>

590
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:12,230
<font color="yellow">Listen up carefully. This is the
difference between me and you guys.</font>

591
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,590
<font color="yellow">Yeop Jeong, if there's anything you know,
say it. Don't beat around the bush.</font>

592
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,150
<font color="yellow">That was not something to be brought
up<b> in front of the children.</b></font>

593
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:32,870
<font color="yellow">It was going to be known
by everybody someday.</font>

594
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:39,530
<font color="yellow">The barrier has certainly not been broken.
It isn't an outside force.</font>

595
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:44,350
<font color="yellow">Then that means it was an inside job.</font>

596
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,280
<font color="yellow">Isn't that worse?</font>

597
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,800
<font color="yellow">As expected... to find the Cheon Ui Joo...</font>

598
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:00,530
<font color="yellow">Professor Beop Gong. We cannot know
if the Cheon Ui Joo was their goal.</font>

599
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,830
<font color="yellow">Do not make reckless assumptions.</font>

600
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:11,400
<font color="yellow">The voice of doubt, claiming
that eighteen years ago,</font>

601
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,610
<font color="yellow">you were the one who stole the key
from Chae Yoon, is ever stronger.</font>

602
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,730
<font color="yellow">Of course, you wouldn't have...</font>

603
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,780
<font color="yellow">Please stop!</font>

604
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:38,470
<font color="yellow">Professor Beop Gong, weren't you one
who wasn't swayed by unfounded rumors?</font>

605
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:47,250
<font color="yellow">I am only saying that if you
have one part of the key,</font>

606
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:53,370
<font color="yellow">I would like to help you
find the others as well.</font>

607
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,990
<font color="yellow">Do you really not have it?</font>

608
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:18,560
<font color="yellow">So the Cheon Ui Joo that gives you all
the power in the world really existed.</font>

609
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,730
<font color="yellow">To think that the key
was with the Chairman.</font>

610
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:25,530
<font color="yellow">It isn't guaranteed that
the Chairman has the key.</font>

611
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:28,356
<font color="yellow">What is with that key?
Why is it so important</font>

612
00:56:28,368 --> 00:56:31,020
<font color="yellow">that the Headmaster's
office was ransacked?</font>

613
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:38,320
<font color="yellow">Eighteen years ago, the Moorim Association
was assaulted by the destructive force.</font>

614
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,770
<font color="yellow">Assault?</font>

615
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:46,310
<font color="yellow">The victims were the Moorim representative
guarding the key and his family.</font>

616
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:53,250
<font color="yellow">But something happened that night,
and the key just disappeared.</font>

617
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,970
<font color="yellow">So then, the destructive force took it?</font>

618
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,030
<font color="yellow">What's the destructive force?</font>

619
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:03,310
<font color="yellow">It's an organization within Moorim.</font>

620
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,469
<font color="yellow">Instead of protecting
the Cheon Ui Joo, they</font>

621
00:57:05,481 --> 00:57:07,410
<font color="yellow">intended to use it for
selfish purposes.</font>

622
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:12,090
<font color="yellow">It seems like their true
identity has yet to be revealed.</font>

623
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:17,210
<font color="yellow">Then, if the missing key
is with the Chairman,</font>

624
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,960
<font color="yellow">the Headmaster is...</font>

625
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:31,910
<font color="yellow">The man who died then was the
Headmaster's best friend.</font>

626
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,890
<font color="yellow">Within the family, there
were young children too.</font>

627
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,130
<font color="yellow">There's no way... <b>The Headmaster
isn't someone who would do that.</b></font>

628
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:43,210
<font color="yellow">That's how the rumors go.</font>

629
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,270
<font color="yellow">But if the key to the Cheon
Ui Joo is in this school...</font>

630
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:53,270
<font color="yellow">The rumor would then be true.</font>

631
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:10,050
<font color="yellow">If the destructive force
wants to terrorize us,</font>

632
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:13,890
<font color="yellow">shouldn't we do something about it?</font>

633
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:17,570
<font color="yellow">This isn't something we can
just cover up, Headmaster!</font>

634
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:23,690
<font color="yellow">The students should be
informed and well prepared.</font>

635
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:28,530
<font color="yellow">I have an idea.</font>

636
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,520
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping?</font>

637
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,840
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

638
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,030
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

639
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,970
<font color="yellow">Let's sleep.</font>

640
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,450
<font color="yellow">Okay. Sleep tight.</font>

641
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:23,010
<font color="yellow">Headmaster.</font>

642
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:34,620
<font color="yellow">Everyone is very confused.
Of course, I am too.</font>

643
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:43,330
<font color="yellow">I was about your age when I
heard about the Cheon Ui Joo.</font>

644
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:50,210
<font color="yellow">Do you really have it?</font>

645
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,090
<font color="yellow">Better than saying that I have it,</font>

646
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:03,050
<font color="yellow">this school having it would be right.</font>

647
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:09,470
<font color="yellow">Because the reason I wanted to establish
Moorim School <b>was because of that friend.</b></font>

648
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:12,090
<font color="yellow">The one you've told me about last time?</font>

649
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:22,490
<font color="yellow">Yes. Actually I am only
substituting that friend.</font>

650
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:25,547
<font color="yellow">Also, in order to be the
owner of Moorim School, the</font>

651
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:28,570
<font color="yellow">student that has the abilities
to safeguard the key,</font>

652
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,050
<font color="yellow">is still trying to be found.</font>

653
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,450
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

654
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:51,910
<font color="yellow">It seems like we are not
the only ones awake.</font>

655
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,790
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better now?</font>

656
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:13,050
<font color="yellow">I am all good. Thanks to your help.</font>

657

<font color="yellow">Could the ONP Holdings you mentioned.</font>

658
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,909
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to ask.
I know the company has</font>

659
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:28,010
<font color="yellow">many buildings and
partners in Seoul, but...</font>

660
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:34,030
<font color="yellow">It's strange that this
happened exactly there.</font>

661
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:41,490
<font color="yellow">Soon Deok was kidnapped and I
was hurt there of all places.</font>

662
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:46,670
<font color="yellow">That company has been done
for since a long time ago.</font>

663
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,370
<font color="yellow">Does my father know about this as well?</font>

664
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:56,570
<font color="yellow">I haven't told him. <b>Why?</b></font>

665
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:01,830
<font color="yellow">I did not want him to be
disappointed in you again.</font>

666
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:05,271
<font color="yellow">The Chairman has been

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

669
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:16,450

was always the problem.</font>

670
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:17,850
<font color="yellow">A justification?</font>

671
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:24,110
<font color="yellow">The perfect reason for him to
confidently name you his heir.</font>
