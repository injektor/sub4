00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,490
<font color="yellow">Gosh, so why do I get a pang in my heart...</font>

157
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,520
<font color="yellow">whenever I see those two?</font>

158
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,920
<font color="yellow">What is this feeling?</font>

159
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,020
<font color="yellow">He must've been very lonely.</font>

160
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,620
<font color="yellow">He must've wanted to be comforted.</font>

161
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,820
<font color="yellow">That's why he just...</font>

162
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,820
<font color="yellow">That's why he just fell for whoever he could find.</font>

163
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,220
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

164
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,720
<font color="yellow">That must be it.</font>

165
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,510
<font color="yellow">Information about your appointment on February 11th.</font>

166
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,910
<font color="yellow">Please go to the administration office...</font>

167
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,120
<font color="yellow">on the first floor and follow the check-in procedure.</font>

168
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
<font color="yellow">One is in London,</font>

169
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,183
<font color="yellow">and the other one is in Milan for photo shoots.</font>

170
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:54,207
<font color="yellow">Their schedules show that they have a day off.</font>

171
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,710
<font color="yellow">And it happens to be on the exact same day.</font>

172
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,810
<font color="yellow">Can you stop by my office in the afternoon?</font>

173
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,310
<font color="yellow">- I have something to tell you.
- Wouldn't she go to see him?</font>

174
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,510
<font color="yellow">- I must see you.
- To London?</font>

175
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,390
<font color="yellow">No. They'll meet in a totally unexpected place.</font>

176
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,514
<font color="yellow">Who wants to go? Raise your hand.</font>

177
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:08,000
<font color="yellow">I'm going to say no.</font>

178
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,983
<font color="yellow">I can't go anywhere this week because of the film festival.</font>

179
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,810
<font color="yellow">I can't go either. I have five interviews scheduled.</font>

180
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,217
<font color="yellow">Here. Me. I'll go.</font>

181
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:19,083
<font color="yellow">Well, don't you have to go home early to take care of your baby?</font>

182
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,483
<font color="yellow">I need to make money to take care of my baby. So work comes first.</font>

183
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,117
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'll miss him though.</font>

184
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:26,210
<font color="yellow">I'll miss hanging out with my lovely son...</font>

185
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,553
<font color="yellow">who blows my ears out with his cries.</font>

186
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,010
<font color="yellow">I can handle not seeing him for a week.</font>

187
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,290
<font color="yellow">I'll squeeze myself into an economy seat for 10 hours...</font>

188
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,614
<font color="yellow">to contribute to the continued success of the company.</font>

189
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:36,620
<font color="yellow">You can't go.</font>

190
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,910
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to work with me. You can't just abandon me like that.</font>

191
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,614
<font color="yellow">No one else is available. Who else will go if i don't?</font>

192
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:43,620
<font color="yellow">I'll go.</font>

193
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

194
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,590
<font color="yellow">I need to disappear from someone's life...</font>

195
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,220
<font color="yellow">for a little while.</font>

196
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,620
<font color="yellow">I was thinking of blowing everything up,</font>

197
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,020
<font color="yellow">including the story and you as well.</font>

198
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,120
<font color="yellow">But I realised that...</font>

199
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
<font color="yellow">I was too nervous to do it.</font>

200
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,900
<font color="yellow">Tell me. I'm curious.</font>

201
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,720
<font color="yellow">The woman of your love triangle.</font>

202
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
<font color="yellow">Was she moved?</font>

203
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,820
<font color="yellow">When you confessed your feelings to her in the morning?</font>

204
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,460
<font color="yellow">Good luck with your work trip to Europe.</font>

205
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,390
<font color="yellow">That's what you should be focusing on now. And...</font>

206
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,720
<font color="yellow">thanks for not publishing the story.</font>

207
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,210
<font color="yellow">- What's that?
- They're receipts for...</font>

208
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,900
<font color="yellow">my things at the place you call our home.</font>

209
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,010
<font color="yellow">Go and get refunds.</font>

210
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,083
<font color="yellow">- Why should I do that?
- Then shall I do it myself?</font>

211
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,083
<font color="yellow">I already embarrassed my face enough at our wedding.</font>

212
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,710
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have to humiliate myself again at the department store.</font>

213
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,120
<font color="yellow">So let's live together without having to embarrass ourselves.</font>

214
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,220
<font color="yellow">Living with you will humiliate me even more.</font>

215
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,560
<font color="yellow">You're so below my standards.</font>

216
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,583
<font color="yellow">Just settle down now.</font>

217
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,620
<font color="yellow">Even if you leave me hoping to meet someone else,</font>

218
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,483
<font color="yellow">things won't be like before.</font>

219
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,090
<font color="yellow">Take a good look at yourself in the mirror.</font>

220
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,310
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Your skin is starting to sag.</font>

221
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,553
<font color="yellow">- I see wrinkles around your eyes.
- Goodness.</font>

222
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,620
<font color="yellow">You even have a bit of belly now.</font>

223
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,920
<font color="yellow">And your bottom is...</font>

224
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

225
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,217
<font color="yellow">They're definitely not like before.</font>

226
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:40,083
<font color="yellow">Come to your senses now, seriously.</font>

227
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,020
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can live off taking photos in your bikinis forever?</font>

228
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,383
<font color="yellow">The number of visitors to your site has dropped too, no?</font>

229
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,270
<font color="yellow">- Are you done?
- Listen.</font>

230
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,990
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying that living with a husband who brings you...</font>

231
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,020
<font color="yellow">his monthly salary wouldn't be a bad thing.</font>

232
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,020
<font color="yellow">Think about it. Getting a refund isn't what's urgent.</font>

233
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,990
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it. I should settle down eventually.</font>

234
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

235
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,220
<font color="yellow">it won't be with you.</font>

236
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,117
<font color="yellow">- You have nowhere to go though.
- Don't you worry.</font>

237
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,030
<font color="yellow">There's someone who will welcome me with open arms.</font>

238
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,820
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Who says you can come in?</font>

239
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,560
<font color="yellow">I have nowhere else to go. You know my situation!</font>

240
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,617
<font color="yellow">Then go to Mi Mo's place.</font>

241
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:23,920
<font color="yellow">She'll be happy to have someone to check in on her every day.</font>

242
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
<font color="yellow">She has Ppoppo! I'm scared of that dog.</font>

243
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,701
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why are you scared of Ppoppo? He's so tiny.</font>

244
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,320
<font color="yellow">He's so ugly!</font>

245
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,283
<font color="yellow">Listen, Ae Ran. You. What did you just say?</font>

246
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:36,453
<font color="yellow">You just insulted him.</font>

247
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:40,210
<font color="yellow">Wrinkly things scare me so much! I get so anxious looking at him.</font>

248
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,483
<font color="yellow">What if I get wrinkly like him?</font>

249
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:43,019
<font color="yellow">You just wait.</font>

250
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,383
<font color="yellow">I'm going to find and bring a dog that is covered in wrinkles.</font>

251
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,890
<font color="yellow">Don't even try.</font>

252
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,720
<font color="yellow">- Goodness!
- Gosh!</font>

253
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

254
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,009
<font color="yellow">So? You really want to adopt a dog?</font>

255
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,383
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm just saying it.</font>

256
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:01,890
<font color="yellow">I know that Ae Ran has nowhere to go.</font>

257
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,694
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

258
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:06,290
<font color="yellow">You're so sweet.</font>

259
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,453
<font color="yellow">You're like an angel. You really are.</font>

260
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:14,820
<font color="yellow">Well, you know. I used to be part of Angels.</font>

261
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,523
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm going to use the washroom quickly.</font>

262
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:24,920
<font color="yellow">Hurry. Your angel here doesn't like waiting.</font>

263
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,183
<font color="yellow">Look at this. Why is this expensive scarf...</font>

264
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,820
<font color="yellow">getting so much fluff already?</font>

265
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,483
<font color="yellow">Hello? This is Lee Wook's phone...</font>

266
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:01,073
<font color="yellow">Lee Wook's phone? I'm his wife.</font>

267
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,117
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

268
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,983
<font color="yellow">I think you dialled the wrong number.</font>

269
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,523
<font color="yellow">- Please check the number and...
- I didn't dial the wrong number.</font>

270
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,820
<font color="yellow">I even know Lee Wook's resident registration number.</font>

271
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,617
<font color="yellow">I see. Is that so?</font>

272
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,453
<font color="yellow">You know his resident registration number?</font>

273
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,414
<font color="yellow">How much did you pay to buy the number?</font>

274
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:19,820
<font color="yellow">People who do voice phishing are so rude these days.</font>

275
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,026
<font color="yellow">Is this a new tactic?</font>

276
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,360
<font color="yellow">- You!
- What?</font>

277
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,523
<font color="yellow">Listen. Today is your lucky day.</font>

278
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:29,620
<font color="yellow">I want to teach you a lesson, but I'll be nice to you today.</font>

279
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,353
<font color="yellow">Why don't you get some help if you want to find a husband?</font>

280
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:38,030
<font color="yellow">My friend owns a matchmaking company.</font>

281
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
<font color="yellow">Why did you turn off your phone?</font>

282
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,030
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

283
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,620
<font color="yellow">I must save my man.</font>

284
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,100
<font color="yellow">Dong Mi.</font>

285
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,611
<font color="yellow">Can't you smell something?</font>

286
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:12,720
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

287
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,590
<font color="yellow">This?</font>

288
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, it smells delicious.</font>

289
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,597
<font color="yellow">I haven't even met him, but I smell Bang Dong Bae from this guy.</font>

290
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,820
<font color="yellow">From what I gather, I think he is...</font>

291
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,620
<font color="yellow">a scammer. He's a swindler.</font>

292
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,810
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Be careful.</font>

293
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,710
<font color="yellow">If he started talking about money and even mentioned specific amounts,</font>

294
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,536
<font color="yellow">the relationship will likely end at a police station.</font>

295
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,063
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Do you even know anything about Wook?</font>

296
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:43,797
<font color="yellow">He's going through such a rough patch right now.</font>

297
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:45,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dong Mi.</font>

298
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,690
<font color="yellow">I lied to you.</font>

299
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,220
<font color="yellow">I actually...</font>

300
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,530
<font color="yellow">have kids.</font>

301
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,590
<font color="yellow">I have a son and a daughter. That phone call...</font>

302
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,983
<font color="yellow">was my ex-wife calling to threaten me.</font>

303
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:01,290
<font color="yellow">She wants money for raising the kids.</font>

304
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,117
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was scared you might reject me...</font>

456
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
<font color="yellow">Did he study while raising Min Woo?</font>

457
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,820

458

462
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,620

463
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,460

465

467
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,620
<font color="yellow">I guess he will like a beautiful woman.</font>

468
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,220
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

469
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,270

470
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,460

471
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,453
<font color="yellow">It has to be a warm-hearted woman who will take care of...</font>

472
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,220
<font color="yellow">Min Woo like her own son.</font>

473

<font color="yellow">People who come to my agency only care about credentials.</font>

474
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,720
<font color="yellow">Where can I find a warm-hearted person?</font>

475
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,620
<font color="yellow">From now on, you should only talk about me with your mouth...</font>

476
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,990
<font color="yellow">and only think about me with your head.</font>

477
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,620

479
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,090

480
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,220
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

481

482
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,930
<font color="yellow">If you do that one more time, I will really get sulky.</font>

483
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,207
<font color="yellow">Don't even get close to him. You'll get hurt.</font>

484
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:03,590
<font color="yellow">You're the one that's going to end up scarred and exhausted.</font>

485

<font color="yellow">If you realised that you like her,</font>

486
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,490

487

510
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:41,820

00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,810
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to write those things there.</font>

610
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,217
<font color="yellow">What's your ideal height? Do you like women with double eyelids?</font>

611
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:23,183
<font color="yellow">Do you care if she's had a plastic surgery? What's the ideal body type?</font>

612
00:47:23,183 --> 00:47:24,590
<font color="yellow">Write your preferences.</font>

613
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,190
<font color="yellow">The ideal height would be 163cm.</font>

614
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,820
<font color="yellow">She has double eyelids.</font>

615
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,120
<font color="yellow">I don't think she's had any plastic surgeries.</font>

616
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,620
<font color="yellow">She's petite.</font>

617
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,820
<font color="yellow">Is that enough information?</font>

618
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's good.</font>

619
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,020
<font color="yellow">Write them down. In that section.</font>

620
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,490
<font color="yellow">It's cold.</font>

621
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,090
<font color="yellow">Ko Dong Mi?</font>

622
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,614
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You haven't changed at all!</font>

623
00:48:19,614 --> 00:48:22,190
<font color="yellow">How can you still look exactly the same?</font>

624
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,720
<font color="yellow">I must say that's a special talent.</font>

625
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,553
<font color="yellow">Dong Mi. Get some work done on your face.</font>

626
00:48:28,553 --> 00:48:31,290
<font color="yellow">- I feel so bad for you...
- Hi.</font>

627
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,720
<font color="yellow">Who is this man you're talking to?</font>

628
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,090
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Who is this man?</font>

629
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,820
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

630
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,120
<font color="yellow">- He's my boyfriend.
- What? Your boyfriend?</font>

631
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,480
<font color="yellow">I haven't changed one bit,</font>

632
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,810
<font color="yellow">but I'm now with a much better man, aren't I?</font>

633
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,383
<font color="yellow">Hey, just ignore people whom you don't want to see.</font>

634
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:56,510
<font color="yellow">Don't even talk to him. He's disgusting.</font>

635
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,190
<font color="yellow">- He's disgusting.
- Yes, that's right.</font>

636
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,017
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

637
00:49:04,017 --> 00:49:06,414
<font color="yellow">I put in the money for this month too.</font>

638
00:49:06,414 --> 00:49:09,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Please don't do this.</font>

639
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,090
<font color="yellow">I knew that you wouldn't want to accept it, but...</font>

640
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,490
<font color="yellow">I really want to help you.</font>

641
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,590
<font color="yellow">When your heart aches,</font>

642
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,620
<font color="yellow">my heart aches too.</font>

643
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,720
<font color="yellow">Are you mad at me?</font>

644
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,390
<font color="yellow">If you're not comfortable with it...</font>

645
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
<font color="yellow">I'll...</font>

646
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,990
<font color="yellow">accept your generosity.</font>

647
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,580
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

648
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,620
<font color="yellow">The only thing I can give you</font>

649
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,290
<font color="yellow">Is this song</font>

650
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,190
<font color="yellow">The only thing I have</font>

651
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,590
<font color="yellow">Is this voice of mine</font>

652
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,183
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure</font>

653
00:49:57,183 --> 00:50:01,720
<font color="yellow">If this will be able to put a smile on your face</font>

654
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,820
<font color="yellow">But I will sing for you</font>

655
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,490
<font color="yellow">I hope that you can feel my love</font>

656
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,710
<font color="yellow">This song is the only gift I can give you</font>

657
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,800
<font color="yellow">That darn song is polluting my ears!</font>

658
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,920
<font color="yellow">- I can't sleep because of it!
- Then go to Mi Mo's place.</font>

659
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,173
<font color="yellow">Goodness. My life is so annoying right now.</font>

660
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:24,390
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that I'm stressed out because of the sales dropping?</font>

661
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,190
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to annoy me like this?</font>

662
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

663
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,290
<font color="yellow">Wait, Bong Bong Mi.</font>

664
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,820
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

665
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,290
<font color="yellow">When you say hello,</font>

666
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,520
<font color="yellow">you need to bow like this.</font>

667
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,190
<font color="yellow">Angels.</font>

668
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,290
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Hong Ae Ran?</font>

669
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:25,010
<font color="yellow">What are the security guards doing? What's this nobody doing here?</font>

670
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,310
<font color="yellow">- What? Nobody?
- Are you here to perform, then?</font>

671
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,180
<font color="yellow">I followed the proper steps and left my ID at the front desk...</font>

672
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,190
<font color="yellow">- and got a visiting card!
- Are you here to sell those?</font>

673
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,180
<font color="yellow">Do you know that everyone here hates it when you do this?</font>

674
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,617
<font color="yellow">You pester them about trying on your clothes and taking photos.</font>

675
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:44,190
<font color="yellow">Stop bothering everyone.</font>

676
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:48,983
<font color="yellow">I get it. Earning a living can be difficult.</font>

677
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:50,590
<font color="yellow">But don't be so ridiculous, okay?</font>

678
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,920
<font color="yellow">How dare she.</font>

679
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:58,290
<font color="yellow">I will no longer provide my clothes to these witches.</font>

680
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,820
<font color="yellow">I don't need any of your help, okay?</font>

681
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,710
<font color="yellow">I'm furious.</font>

682
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,390
<font color="yellow">(Enter to win: A special delivery from Ae Ran!)</font>

683
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,710
<font color="yellow">Congratulations. A special delivery from Ae Ran is here.</font>

684
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,620
<font color="yellow">You are one of the winners of the event.</font>

685
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,580
<font color="yellow">I'm in front of your building now with your order.</font>

686
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,797
<font color="yellow">Could you let me in?</font>

687
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:20,910
<font color="yellow">Was there an event like that? There's a knitted hat I like.</font>

688
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,120
<font color="yellow">Can I get that hat instead?</font>

689
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,120
<font color="yellow">- Who is it again?
- I'm Hong Ae Ran.</font>

690
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,920
<font color="yellow">I'm one of the former members of Angels.</font>

691
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,610
<font color="yellow">Loving you, loving you</font>

692
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,290
<font color="yellow">I see. You can leave it with the concierge.</font>

693
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,183
<font color="yellow">Goodness. My wife must've bought more things online.</font>

694
00:52:42,183 --> 00:52:45,620
<font color="yellow">- I'll leave it with the concierge.
- Can you stop spending money?</font>

695
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,453
<font color="yellow">- Well, I just...
- What are you doing, seriously?</font>

696
00:52:48,453 --> 00:52:50,490
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ma'am.</font>

697
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,120
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my heart.</font>

698
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,920
<font color="yellow">I'm so honoured to meet you in person.</font>

699
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,270
<font color="yellow">I've been collecting these. These are my biggest treasures...</font>

700
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,920
<font color="yellow">that are one-of-a-kind.</font>

701
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,490
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

702
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,920
<font color="yellow">I had over 1,000 angel breads to collect all these stickers.</font>

703
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,320
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

704
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,620
<font color="yellow">I'm your biggest fan.</font>

705
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,514
<font color="yellow">Loving you, loving you</font>

706
00:53:52,514 --> 00:53:57,290
<font color="yellow">Till the moment my heart stops beating</font>

707
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,990
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

708
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,220
<font color="yellow">I can't thank you enough.</font>

709
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,320
<font color="yellow">I love you!</font>

710
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,220
<font color="yellow">She's 163cm tall, has double eyelids and is petite.</font>

711
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,110
<font color="yellow">She's whatever.</font>

712
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,120
<font color="yellow">Whatever?</font>

713
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,720
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much money she spent to get her face fixed?</font>

714
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,110
<font color="yellow">Although I put my clients' satisfaction before anything,</font>

715
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,010
<font color="yellow">it's a bit hard to find a woman of your description.</font>

716
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,283
<font color="yellow">Actually, it's very hard.</font>

717
00:54:32,283 --> 00:54:34,460
<font color="yellow">So, you have to give me a break.</font>

718
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,920
<font color="yellow">Can't you give her a chance since she's pretty?</font>

719
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,420
<font color="yellow">Go and find her that day. Do you hear me?</font>

720
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,820
<font color="yellow">I don't see which part of her is pretty.</font>

721
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,920
<font color="yellow">No, thanks.</font>

722
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,617
<font color="yellow">This is supposed to be a designer brand.</font>

723
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:00,217
<font color="yellow">Why does it have so much fluff on it?</font>

724
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:03,010
<font color="yellow">If you can't make it as good as new, I'd like to exchange it.</font>

725
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,220
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

726
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,220
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Okay.</font>

727
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,720
<font color="yellow">Hello. A customer brought this.</font>

728
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,510
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to tell you this,</font>

729
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,010
<font color="yellow">but this isn't ours.</font>

730
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,120
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

731
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,504
<font color="yellow">It isn't?</font>

732
00:55:47,504 --> 00:55:51,020
<font color="yellow">The stitches are uneven. And if you take a look here,</font>

733
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,310
<font color="yellow">the word Italy...</font>

734
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,090
<font color="yellow">is misspelt.</font>

735
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,263
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

736
00:55:58,263 --> 00:56:00,120
<font color="yellow">This is fake.</font>

737
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,620
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

738
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,920
<font color="yellow">I'm so materialistic.</font>

739
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,010
<font color="yellow">He must have felt so sad about not being able to buy a real product.</font>

740
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,720
<font color="yellow">Dong Mi, all he has to offer is his song.</font>

741
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,520
<font color="yellow">Brave Wedding wouldn't even consider him as a client.</font>

742
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,790
<font color="yellow">Try living with him and you'll want him to shut up.</font>

743
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,050
<font color="yellow">Something's strange though.</font>

744
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,847
<font color="yellow">He must make a decent amount of money...</font>

745
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:24,020
<font color="yellow">if he's paying that much for child support.</font>

746
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,813
<font color="yellow">The court doesn't ask for a ridiculous amount of money.</font>

747
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:29,040
<font color="yellow">Right? It's weird, isn't it?</font>

748
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,850
<font color="yellow">Leave my guy alone.</font>

749
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,440
<font color="yellow">Worry about yourself!</font>

750
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,450
<font color="yellow">Did you even kiss your boyfriend, yet?</font>

751
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,150
<font color="yellow">It's worse to lack love than lack money.</font>

752
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,124
<font color="yellow">We kissed.</font>

753
00:56:42,124 --> 00:56:44,240
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's been a while.</font>

754
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,837
<font color="yellow">You seriously thought we hadn't kissed?</font>

755
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:47,130
<font color="yellow">Finally?</font>

756
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,450
<font color="yellow">What took him so long?</font>

757
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:49,950
<font color="yellow">What was it like?</font>

758
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,250
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

759
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,850
<font color="yellow">- It was fine.
- What?</font>

760
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,713
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it was fine?</font>

761
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:02,750
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

762
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,783
<font color="yellow">- Is he a pervert?
- What?</font>

763
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:06,550
<font color="yellow">Did he drool all over you?</font>

764
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,547
<font color="yellow">- Is he a sloppy kisser?
- No.</font>

765
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:10,940
<font color="yellow">Then what's the problem?</font>

766
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,050
<font color="yellow">How could your first kiss be just fine?</font>

767
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,720
<font color="yellow">He must have a problem. There's something wrong with him.</font>

768
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,790
<font color="yellow">It's just that...</font>

769
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,550
<font color="yellow">There seems to something missing.</font>

770
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,447
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it is.</font>

771
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:26,940
<font color="yellow">I knew it. You're wrong for each other.</font>

772
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,140
<font color="yellow">You two aren't a good match.</font>

773
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,620
<font color="yellow">I say this raises a red light.</font>

774
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,740
<font color="yellow">Have you made up your mind?</font>

775
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,250
<font color="yellow">I've decided to take the easy path.</font>

776
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,040
<font color="yellow">Does that mean you're going to date A Ni?</font>

777
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,947
<font color="yellow">No, not her.</font>

778
00:57:54,947 --> 00:57:56,250
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

779
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,240
<font color="yellow">You're not going to go for Jung A Ni?</font>

780
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,840
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not.</font>

781
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,150
<font color="yellow">Was there a third girl in the picture?</font>

782
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,303
<font color="yellow">I don't believe you.</font>

783
00:58:05,303 --> 00:58:07,313
<font color="yellow">You have someone else?</font>

784
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:08,520
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

785
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:11,850
<font color="yellow">I'll meet someone new.</font>

786
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,550
<font color="yellow">I want to start fresh.</font>

787
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,140
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

788
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,520
<font color="yellow">Isn't it good to see these?</font>

789
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,740
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

790
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,944
<font color="yellow">Don't do that!</font>

791
00:58:25,944 --> 00:58:27,683
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get kicked out of the house?</font>

792
00:58:27,683 --> 00:58:30,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you so annoying today?</font>

793
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,783
<font color="yellow">These are all good memories.</font>

794
00:58:32,783 --> 00:58:34,950
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

795
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,050
<font color="yellow">Let's burn this one.</font>

796
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,947
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

797
00:58:38,947 --> 00:58:40,447
<font color="yellow">It's okay, it's Koo Seul Ah.</font>

798
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:43,040
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

799
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,150
<font color="yellow">- Stop it!
- Hey.</font>

800
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,950
<font color="yellow">She doesn't like it, either.</font>

801
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,150
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty.</font>

802
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,450
<font color="yellow">I used to be so pretty.</font>

803
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,450
<font color="yellow">- Don't cry.
- Da Jeong.</font>

804
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,550
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

805
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,890
<font color="yellow">You're still pretty.</font>

806
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,050
<font color="yellow">I hope he's dressed nicely.</font>

807
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,150
<font color="yellow">What if he went straight from work?</font>

808
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:23,720
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyuk has a blind date today.</font>

809
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,020
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

810
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,890
<font color="yellow">You've been telling me for the past few days.</font>

811
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,140
<font color="yellow">I told him what to wear and how to do his hair.</font>

812
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,050
<font color="yellow">But he never listens to me.</font>

813
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,040
<font color="yellow">What if he sulks in front of his date?</font>

814
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,750
<font color="yellow">I can't tell him to keep his mouth shut.</font>

815
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,350
<font color="yellow">You know how good he is at annoying other people.</font>

816
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,330
<font color="yellow">At least he's good at something.</font>

817
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,450
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyuk, that guy...</font>

818
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,530
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

819
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,550
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

820
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,950
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- You're not interested in eating.</font>

821
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,037
<font color="yellow">Are you mad?</font>

822
01:00:01,037 --> 01:00:02,050
<font color="yellow">Mi Mo...</font>

823
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,750
<font color="yellow">You're more inconsiderate of others than I thought.</font>

824
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,140
<font color="yellow">You, Soo Hyuk and I ate together,</font>

825
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,950
<font color="yellow">had coffee together and went to the movies together.</font>

826
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:13,140
<font color="yellow">You've been talking about the blind date so much...</font>

827
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,590
<font color="yellow">that I can practically see what he's wearing in my head...</font>

828
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,313
<font color="yellow">and also hear the conversation he'll be having today.</font>

829
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,850
<font color="yellow">I can't tell if I'm dating you...</font>

830
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,150
<font color="yellow">or Soo Hyuk.</font>

831
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:29,150
<font color="yellow">It's just that I know you two are close.</font>

832
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,350
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be concerned...</font>

833
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,550
<font color="yellow">and want this to work out for him as well.</font>

834
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,050
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

835
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:39,850
<font color="yellow">I had no idea it made you so uncomfortable.</font>

836
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,320
<font color="yellow">You're inconsiderate and you really don't know me at all.</font>

837
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,790
<font color="yellow">I even mentioned it to you once.</font>

838
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,320
<font color="yellow">From now on, you should only talk about me with your mouth.</font>

839
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:00,790
<font color="yellow">Is that why you kissed me?</font>

840
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,030
<font color="yellow">To make me stop talking?</font>

841
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,420
<font color="yellow">It was both.</font>

842
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,950
<font color="yellow">It was both?</font>

843
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,820
<font color="yellow">No, I mean...</font>

844
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,450
<font color="yellow">That was our first kiss.</font>

845
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:15,550
<font color="yellow">Don't treat me with disrespect.</font>

846
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:18,150
<font color="yellow">I may have told you I liked you first.</font>

847
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,613
<font color="yellow">But that doesn't mean you can kiss me...</font>

848
01:01:20,613 --> 01:01:22,150
<font color="yellow">when you don't even feel like it.</font>

849
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,620
<font color="yellow">Why would you think I disrespect you?</font>

850
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,420
<font color="yellow">We should go.</font>

851

- This is a fight.</font>

<font color="yellow">And I'd like to leave, too.</font>

853

<font color="yellow">I miss you, too.</font>

854
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:12,550
<font color="yellow">Just wait. I'll get off work soon and get there as fast as I can.</font>

855
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,313
<font color="yellow">I'll even bring my wings.</font>

856
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:17,890
<font color="yellow">Okay, see you soon.</font>
