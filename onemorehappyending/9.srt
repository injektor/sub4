3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,910
<font color="yellow">Is she all right? She's going to wake up, right?</font>

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,310
<font color="yellow">Yes. You don't need to worry.</font>

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,310
<font color="yellow">She's fine.</font>

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,010
<font color="yellow">But she's unconscious. Why isn't she opening her eyes?</font>

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,110
<font color="yellow">She's sleeping.</font>

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,510
<font color="yellow">She's sleeping? She didn't pass out?</font>

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,010
<font color="yellow">When a person gets extremely embarrassed,</font>

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,910
<font color="yellow">their brain gets tired rapidly.</font>

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,610
<font color="yellow">So right now, that's exactly what's happening to her.</font>

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,080
<font color="yellow">Her brain is embarrassed,</font>

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,210
<font color="yellow">so it decided to forget everything and...</font>

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,680
<font color="yellow">just go to bed.</font>

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,510
<font color="yellow">When she gets up,</font>

16
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,410
<font color="yellow">just give her some warm water.</font>

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,310
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,510
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving? Doesn't she need an IV?</font>

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,710
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,180
<font color="yellow">Just warm water will do.</font>

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,620
<font color="yellow">But she's not waking up.</font>

22
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,310
<font color="yellow">It's snowing outside.</font>

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,310
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming at this late hour.</font>

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,650
<font color="yellow">Kim Yu Na is my wife.</font>

25
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,580
<font color="yellow">She looks very young though.</font>

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,580
<font color="yellow">You are the man, Sir.</font>

27
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,210
<font color="yellow">I will give you a friendly advice.</font>

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,280
<font color="yellow">Live alone.</font>

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,010
<font color="yellow">That way, you get to have a peaceful sleep...</font>

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,710
<font color="yellow">late at night.</font>

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,610
<font color="yellow">Even if you fall asleep on the sofa while drinking beer,</font>

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,580
<font color="yellow">nobody will slap you in the back.</font>

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,610
<font color="yellow">Live alone, for that brilliant night.</font>

34
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,280
<font color="yellow">Bye, then.</font>

35
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,680
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,380
<font color="yellow">Hey, Goldfish. Why would you go in there?</font>

37
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,310
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

38
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,710
<font color="yellow">They say if you confess your love on a snowy day,</font>

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,710
<font color="yellow">your wish will be granted.</font>

40
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,710
<font color="yellow">Now, let's find the hidden colours.</font>

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,580
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

42
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,010
<font color="yellow">Can't you see it? It's a snowman.</font>

43
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,910
<font color="yellow">That's a snowman?</font>

44
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,080
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about this, and I think the snowman is too fat.</font>

45
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,080
<font color="yellow">Its tummy is too big.</font>

46
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,510
<font color="yellow">In his world, there should be several ones with an ideal body.</font>

47
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,680
<font color="yellow">Hey Goldfish, I'm going home late because of you.</font>

48
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,480
<font color="yellow">You are not Juliet. You are just a goldfish.</font>

49
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,810
<font color="yellow">Don't call me a goldfish.</font>

50
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,480
<font color="yellow">Because you call me that, I forget things more often.</font>

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,110
<font color="yellow">Goldfish, I am tired. I am frustrated.</font>

52
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,410
<font color="yellow">Then tell our teacher that you don't want to be Romeo.</font>

53
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,510
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk to you. I'm leaving.</font>

54
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,110
<font color="yellow">Aren't you a brave girl.</font>

55
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,510
<font color="yellow">Let's go together. I'll take you home.</font>

56
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,510
<font color="yellow">I have feet too. I can go alone.</font>

57
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,410
<font color="yellow">You're a girl too. It's dangerous to walk alone at night.</font>

58
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,110
<font color="yellow">Wow, there are so many stars in the sky.</font>

59
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,010
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you know?</font>

60
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,910
<font color="yellow">That the dark sky is covering...</font>

61
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,110
<font color="yellow">the thousands of stars in the sky?</font>

62
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,510
<font color="yellow">Look. When you get rid of the black crayon,</font>

64
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,820
<font color="yellow">there will only be stars left.</font>

65
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,110
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can there be only stars up there?</font>

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,820
<font color="yellow">There's the sun, the moon,</font>

67
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,550
<font color="yellow">the rain and the snow.</font>

68
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,910
<font color="yellow">Stupid. Look. There's snow too.</font>

69
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,820
<font color="yellow">Stars come together and become the sun and the moon.</font>

70
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,910
<font color="yellow">Rain falls because the stars becomes sad and cry.</font>

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,410
<font color="yellow">Snow falls when the stars cry out of happiness.</font>

72
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,820
<font color="yellow">Nothing smiles? I like smiles.</font>

73
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,510
<font color="yellow">I told you. Snow falls when the stars cry out of happiness.</font>

74
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,610
<font color="yellow">When you are so happy, you don't smile. You cry.</font>

75
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,110
<font color="yellow">You cry when you're happy?</font>

76
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,310
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

77
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,710
<font color="yellow">That's why they say snow is the stars' blessing.</font>

78
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,910
<font color="yellow">They say if you confess your love on a snowy day,</font>

79
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,380
<font color="yellow">your wish will be granted.</font>

80
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,680
<font color="yellow">I hope it snows when we do the play.</font>

81
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,080
<font color="yellow">I hope it snows a lot.</font>

82
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,410
<font color="yellow">Whatever I say today,</font>

83
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,410
<font color="yellow">I feel like I will be forgiven...</font>

84
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,110
<font color="yellow">because it's snowing outside.</font>

85
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,580
<font color="yellow">So I'll say this for the first and last time.</font>

86
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,910
<font color="yellow">I'll muster up the courage to tell you how I feel.</font>

87
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,810
<font color="yellow">The girl who's 163cm in height,</font>

88
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,110
<font color="yellow">has double eyelids,</font>

89
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,410
<font color="yellow">hasn't gotten plastic surgery,</font>

90
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,110
<font color="yellow">has a petite build...</font>

91
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,710
<font color="yellow">and has a lovable flaw...</font>

92
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,710
<font color="yellow">is you.</font>

93
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,610
<font color="yellow">You goldfish.</font>

94
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,810
<font color="yellow">(Student Number 15, Song Soo Hyuk)</font>

95
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,610
<font color="yellow">Yes! I can get the jewellery box!</font>

96
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes!</font>

97
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,420
<font color="yellow">- Ring. - Ring?</font>

98
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,510
<font color="yellow">Yes, a wedding ring.</font>

99
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,810
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

100
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,420
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

101
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,310
<font color="yellow">Oh, here it is.</font>

102
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,080
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about you.</font>

103
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,710
<font color="yellow">You goldfish.</font>

104
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,110
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

105
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,810
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

106
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,710
<font color="yellow">Did your husband sleep well yesterday?</font>

107
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,810
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - He looked very tired.</font>

108
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,580
<font color="yellow">It's all because he's getting old.</font>

109
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh. This is why...</font>

110
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,710
<font color="yellow">I should've married someone similar to my age.</font>

111
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,310
<font color="yellow">By the way, my students...</font>

112
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,110
<font color="yellow">are performing "Romeo and Juliet" at the end of this month.</font>

113
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,110
<font color="yellow">You should both come if you can.</font>

114
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,510
<font color="yellow">That would be nice, but it's a bit too far.</font>

115
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,310
<font color="yellow">I hope you can make it.</font>

116
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,710
<font color="yellow">This time,</font>

117
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,110
<font color="yellow">Romeo and Juliet don't die from poison.</font>

118
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,210
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that make you curious?</font>

119
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,610
<font color="yellow">Make sure you come to check it out.</font>

120
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,810
<font color="yellow">Also, you should have breakfast...</font>

121
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,180
<font color="yellow">at the restaurant across the street before you leave.</font>

122
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,310
<font color="yellow">I told them you'd be coming.</font>

123
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,610
<font color="yellow">Should we eat before we leave?</font>

124
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,680
<font color="yellow">I guess we could.</font>

125
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,210
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thank you.</font>

126
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,510
<font color="yellow">Eat up. Do you like this kind of food?</font>

127
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,210
<font color="yellow">Of course she does. The grosser it looks, the better she likes it.</font>

128
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,410
<font color="yellow">She thinks that makes it healthier.</font>

129
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,210
<font color="yellow">You make it sound like you were friends forever...</font>

130
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,710
<font color="yellow">when all you did was go to school together.</font>

131
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,010
<font color="yellow">How were the road conditions?</font>

132
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,610
<font color="yellow">I heard they blocked some parts off because of the snow.</font>

133
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,110
<font color="yellow">They cleared it up early this morning.</font>

134
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,310
<font color="yellow">I had to waste some time on the road waiting.</font>

135
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,910
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have come all this way.</font>

136
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,910
<font color="yellow">What kind of event did you come for?</font>

137
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,010
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

138
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,310
<font color="yellow">It was the 50th anniversary of the school foundation.</font>

139
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,410
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyuk and I were chosen from our class...</font>

140
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,580
<font color="yellow">to bury time capsules with something of our own inside.</font>

141
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,080
<font color="yellow">We came to dig it up and give it to the students of the same class.</font>

142
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,310
<font color="yellow">- What did you put in it? - Tinker Bell.</font>

143
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,510
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

144
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,910
<font color="yellow">- Do you think I'd do that? - Why not?</font>

145
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,910
<font color="yellow">I know how delicate you can be.</font>

146
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,010
<font color="yellow">What kind of Tinker Bell was it?</font>

147
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,580
<font color="yellow">Was it pink or green?</font>

148
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,310
<font color="yellow">Pink would suit you better.</font>

149
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,310
<font color="yellow">You looked nice in pink when you used to be a member of Angels.</font>

150
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,410
<font color="yellow">I got sick of wearing white, so I kept complaining to my stylist.</font>

151
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,010
<font color="yellow">That's when she started dressing me in pink.</font>

152
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,310
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

153
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,410
<font color="yellow">Your stylist is the one to blame.</font>

154
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,580

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,110
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that sound fun?</font>

459
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,710
<font color="yellow">I never said I'd do anything to her.</font>

460
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,110
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

461
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,110
<font color="yellow">Goldfish.</font>

462
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,810
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about you, you goldfish.</font>

463
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,210
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about you. You!</font>

464
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,520
<font color="yellow">You, I mean you.</font>

465
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,880
<font color="yellow">I'll spell it out for you in English.</font>

466
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,480
<font color="yellow">Y, O, U. That's you!</font>

467
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,180
<font color="yellow">What in the world...</font>

468
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,680
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't feed the goldfish until tomorrow.</font>

469
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:19,520
<font color="yellow">No, until the day after tomorrow. Let's see if you're cheeky then.</font>

470
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,310
<font color="yellow">What is going on with her?</font>

471
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,910
<font color="yellow">They get hungry every three seconds.</font>

472
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,110
<font color="yellow">How brutal is it to make them starve for three days?</font>

473
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,110
<font color="yellow">I'm just tired.</font>

474
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,680
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

475
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,310
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

476
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,580
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

477
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,680
<font color="yellow">Ms Lee bought this for me. Let's share it.</font>

478
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,680
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

479
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,310
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about you.</font>

480
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,020
<font color="yellow">Song Soo Hyuk?</font>

481
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,310
<font color="yellow">Goldfish.</font>

482
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,110
<font color="yellow">Ms Han.</font>

483
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,810
<font color="yellow">Ms Han?</font>

484
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,910
<font color="yellow">Take this away. I don't want to see it.</font>

485
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,110
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

486
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,780
<font color="yellow">But it's so good.</font>

487
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,810
<font color="yellow">Have dinner with me. Why won't you eat with me?</font>

488
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,810
<font color="yellow">You should eat dinner at home.</font>

489
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,810
<font color="yellow">Don't you have after school classes?</font>

490
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,710
<font color="yellow">Weren't you listening to me last time?</font>

491
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:49,410
<font color="yellow">I don't need to study to make a living.</font>

492
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,910
<font color="yellow">And I can make a good living from my inheritance.</font>

493
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,020
<font color="yellow">I'm the granddaughter of the chairman of the hospital.</font>

494
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,710
<font color="yellow">Good for you for being the granddaughter of the chairman.</font>

495
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,310
<font color="yellow">Wow, you smiled. You looked gloomy the whole time.</font>

496
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,180
<font color="yellow">Do you know I just made you smile?</font>

497
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,210
<font color="yellow">You should date someone who makes you smile.</font>

498
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,410
<font color="yellow">Someone who makes me smile?</font>

499
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,310
<font color="yellow">I know someone...</font>

500
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,350
<font color="yellow">who does that.</font>

501
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,680
<font color="yellow">Try some of this. The soup is a little salty today.</font>

502
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,410
<font color="yellow">- It's fine. - Is it?</font>

503
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,480
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Song Soo Hyuk speaking. - It's been a while.</font>

504
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,610
<font color="yellow">Who's calling?</font>

505
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,410
<font color="yellow">You must not have saved the number I gave you then.</font>

506
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,310
<font color="yellow">- It's Kim Seo Yeon. - I see.</font>

507
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,110
<font color="yellow">- Are you busy now? - Yes.</font>

508
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,680
<font color="yellow">I thought the date went well, but you never asked me out again.</font>

509
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,950
<font color="yellow">I thought of asking Brave Wedding, but just called you myself...</font>

510
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,310
<font color="yellow">since I have your number.</font>

511
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,810
<font color="yellow">- I see. - While I'm at it,</font>

512
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,210
<font color="yellow">would you like to meet up right now?</font>

513
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,580
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

514
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,910
<font color="yellow">What? Right now?</font>

515
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,080
<font color="yellow">- What for? - Because I'd like to see you.</font>

516
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,250
<font color="yellow">Meet her.</font>

517
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,310
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

518
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,510
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to see you. - Wait.</font>

519
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,110
<font color="yellow">You were paid to go on a date, weren't you?</font>

520
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,310
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

521
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,080
<font color="yellow">I heard from the other clients.</font>

522
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,310
<font color="yellow">Everyone that went on a date with you said the same thing.</font>

523
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,310
<font color="yellow">You take all the girls out for a nice first date.</font>

524
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,780
<font color="yellow">Then, you're gone with the wind.</font>

525
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,580
<font color="yellow">Brave Wedding must be paying you to raise the quality of the clients.</font>

526
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,950
<font color="yellow">I don't work for pennies.</font>

527
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,110
<font color="yellow">Who knows if they pay pennies or a hefty chunk of money?</font>

528
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,010
<font color="yellow">I'll bring that company down.</font>

529
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,010
<font color="yellow">Where did you say you were?</font>

530
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,310
<font color="yellow">Why don't we meet right now?</font>

531
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:58,610
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

532
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,610
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

533
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,610
<font color="yellow">Were you glaring at my door?</font>

534
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,410
<font color="yellow">It's not like that. I was just...</font>

535
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,310
<font color="yellow">Listen to me.</font>

536
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,310
<font color="yellow">You should introduce me to better women then!</font>

537
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,680
<font color="yellow">What can I do when I can't find anyone better than you?</font>

538
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,010
<font color="yellow">Ppoppo, isn't he cute?</font>

539
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,510
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about you, you goldfish.</font>

540
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,480
<font color="yellow">Did you just say that?</font>

541
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,610
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous. I'm just tired. That's all.</font>

542
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,410
<font color="yellow">What are you up to, Hae Joon?</font>

543
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,010
<font color="yellow">You're sick? Are you okay?</font>

544
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,180
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

545
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,310
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call to tell me you were sick?</font>

546
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,910
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to get worried when I didn't call.</font>

547
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,310
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you had a grumpy side to you.</font>

548
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,110
<font color="yellow">Will that be enough?</font>

549
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:39,910
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

550
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:46,910
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

551
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,510
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

552
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,610
<font color="yellow">Thank you for worrying about me...</font>

553
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,710
<font color="yellow">and for coming by like this.</font>

554
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,810
<font color="yellow">I don't want to give you my cold.</font>

555
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,310
<font color="yellow">I felt better this morning, so I came to work.</font>

556
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,750
<font color="yellow">That porridge you made must've helped me a lot.</font>

557
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,480
<font color="yellow">- I'm totally fine now. - I see.</font>

558
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,380
<font color="yellow">You should've told me.</font>

559
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,910
<font color="yellow">I'm in front of your place now.</font>

560
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,180
<font color="yellow">You're in front of my place now?</font>

561
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,110
<font color="yellow">I brought something for you.</font>

562
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,510
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

563
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,550
<font color="yellow">I'll give you my door code.</font>

564
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,180
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

565
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,280
<font color="yellow">There are so many dirty dishes.</font>

566
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it smells.</font>

567
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,910
<font color="yellow">It's nice to be out like this.</font>

568
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,650
<font color="yellow">Just a second, okay?</font>

569
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,810
<font color="yellow">Yes, Koo Hae Joon speaking.</font>

570
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,010
<font color="yellow">Right, yes. I'm on my way to the hospital now.</font>

571
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,810
<font color="yellow">- Ouch. - Yes. I'll be there soon.</font>

572
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,910
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Let's go.</font>

573
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's cold.</font>

574
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,380
<font color="yellow">Did you hurt your foot?</font>

575
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

576
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,780
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're so clumsy.</font>

577
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:26,910
<font color="yellow">Wear comfortable shoes.</font>

00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,610
<font color="yellow">(Sarang Hospital)</font>

579
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,010
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

580
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,580
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she coming out?</font>

581
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,510
<font color="yellow">It's so cold!</font>

582
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,410
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Soo Hyuk!</font>

583
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,680
<font color="yellow">Koo Seul Ah had a miscarriage?</font>

584
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,110
<font color="yellow">That womaniser, Kim Jung Hoon, finally caused a mess.</font>

585
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,210
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

588
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,710
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this will make our lives difficult.</font>

589
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,110
<font color="yellow">How long do we have to stay out here?</font>

590
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,450
<font color="yellow">It looks like it'll be a while.</font>

591
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:17,880
<font color="yellow">Shall I order some food?</font>

592
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,910

00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,410
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

594
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,610
<font color="yellow">just order everything.</font>

595

599
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,480
<font color="yellow">cherish our memories.</font>

600
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:37,110
<font color="yellow">What is this mess? He deceived me from the start. My goodness.</font>

601
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,810
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have been in a girl group.</font>

602
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,010
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about now?</font>

603
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,550
<font color="yellow">I read somewhere that...</font>

604
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,280
<font color="yellow">there is a maximum amount of love...</font>

607
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,010
<font color="yellow">So now, we're paying for all the extra love we got.</font>

608
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,510
<font color="yellow">We're paying for it by meeting all these weird guys.</font>

609
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,610
<font color="yellow">Hey! Nobody loved me then!</font>

610
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,010
<font color="yellow">I was so miserable back in those days.</font>

611
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,110
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I deserve to be intoxicated by love now?</font>

612
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,380
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be intoxicated like this!</font>

613
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,780
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting angry?</font>

614
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:07,810
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

615
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:09,810
<font color="yellow">Dong Bae, that jerk.</font>

616
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,710
<font color="yellow">- He's a horrible jerk. - Why?</font>

617
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,510
<font color="yellow">He still hasn't gotten the refunds?</font>

618
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,380
<font color="yellow">Dong Mi. Do you remember what I said before my wedding?</font>

619
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,480
<font color="yellow">I told you that he doesn't make my blood boil with passion.</font>

620
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,080
<font color="yellow">That's right. I remember.</font>

621
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,280
<font color="yellow">But it's strange. After that incident,</font>

622
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,450
<font color="yellow">my blood is starting to heat up again.</font>

623
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,450
<font color="yellow">Of course. You're infuriated.</font>

624
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,050
<font color="yellow">No, not like that.</font>

625
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,910
<font color="yellow">I find him attractive.</font>

626
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,010
<font color="yellow">He's making me want him.</font>

627
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,410
<font color="yellow">You're crazy. Come to your senses, okay?</font>

628
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,610
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

629
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I tell people?</font>

630
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,910
<font color="yellow">We got married in front of all those people,</font>

631
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,510
<font color="yellow">but we haven't registered our marriage.</font>

632
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,310
<font color="yellow">Does this mean I'm divorced or unmarried?</font>

633
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,210
<font color="yellow">- Well... - Should I just live with him?</font>

634
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,180
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous.</font>

635
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,610
<font color="yellow">You have a guy to live with at your disposal.</font>

636
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,210
<font color="yellow">I'm always the only one who is alone.</font>

637
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,510
<font color="yellow">Dong Mi.</font>

638
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,110
<font color="yellow">Shall I get you out of that mood?</font>

639
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,010
<font color="yellow">You'll be surrounded by men and will be too excited to breathe.</font>

640
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,810
<font color="yellow">Is there a place like that?</font>

641
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:45,110
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

642
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why? What do you want?</font>

643
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,310
<font color="yellow">Goodness, move away!</font>

644
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

645
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,080
<font color="yellow">Go over there.</font>

646
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,980
<font color="yellow">Dong Mi! You're not alone.</font>

647
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,080
<font color="yellow">Wait a little bit. I'm going to make all men notice you.</font>

648
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,710
<font color="yellow">Hey! Where are you going?</font>

649
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,010
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

650
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, please!</font>

651
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:27,280
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

652
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,310
<font color="yellow">- What is she doing? - What is that song?</font>

653
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,850
<font color="yellow">- I don't like this song at all. - This is so annoying.</font>

654
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,280
<font color="yellow">- What is she doing now? - Don't even pay attention.</font>

655
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,710
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, come down now already. - Seriously.</font>

656
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,610
<font color="yellow">- Goodness, come down. - Look at her.</font>

657
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,050
<font color="yellow">Has she lost her mind?</font>

658
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,810
<font color="yellow">You look old.</font>

659
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,680
<font color="yellow">Just go home early and take care of your skin, okay?</font>

660
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,010
<font color="yellow">Let's go to a different club.</font>

661
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,410
<font color="yellow">- Come down. Come down already. - Look at her.</font>

662
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,210
<font color="yellow">Dong Mi couldn't believe it.</font>

663
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,710
<font color="yellow">"The woman in his hands right now."</font>

664
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,310
<font color="yellow">"Is this really me?"</font>

665
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,410
<font color="yellow">"Or, am I imagining things because I'm drunk?"</font>

666
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,480
<font color="yellow">"Did my drinks consume me?"</font>

667
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,810
<font color="yellow">"Am I hallucinating right now?"</font>

668
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,210
<font color="yellow">"Am I imagining all this?"</font>

669
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,050
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness the convenience store had this ointment.</font>

670
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:11,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, well... I'm okay.</font>

671
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,380
<font color="yellow">I'm really...</font>

672
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,650
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

673
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,710
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

674
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,910
<font color="yellow">No, it's really...</font>

675
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,910
<font color="yellow">This way, your pretty face won't bruise.</font>

676
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,910
<font color="yellow">Was there a blackout yesterday at that hour?</font>

677
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,810
<font color="yellow">Astigmatism or extreme short-sightedness.</font>

678
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,410
<font color="yellow">Aren't they more persuasive?</font>

679
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,880
<font color="yellow">Stop! It already makes me nervous.</font>

680
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,780
<font color="yellow">It's 2pm on Saturday.</font>

681
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,350
<font color="yellow">I'm going to meet him when the sun is on top of my head.</font>

682
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,210
<font color="yellow">What if he sees me in the daylight and gets disappointed?</font>

683
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. Who knows?</font>

684
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,550
<font color="yellow">The sun might feel bad for you and act as a reflecting plate.</font>

685
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,810
<font color="yellow">Don't tease me! Hurry up and think about it.</font>

686
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,010
<font color="yellow">Give me the idea...</font>

687
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,380
<font color="yellow">to get over our three... I mean our six years of age gap.</font>

688
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,410
<font color="yellow">Is it three or six? Just pick one.</font>

689
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,550
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

690
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,250
<font color="yellow">I lied that I'm 31.</font>

691
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,910
<font color="yellow">He's 28.</font>

692
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,410
<font color="yellow">I'm out. I married an older man, so I have nothing to say.</font>

693
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,050
<font color="yellow">I've never dated a younger guy either.</font>

694
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,050
<font color="yellow">You have.</font>

695
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,010
<font color="yellow">He's 28.</font>

696
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:49,710
<font color="yellow">That's the best age to satisfy the fantasy of girls in their 30s.</font>

697
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,550
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

698
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,410
<font color="yellow">Imagine a man in his early 20s dating Ko Dong Mi.</font>

699
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,980
<font color="yellow">That's a crime. She'll be criticised.</font>

700
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,250
<font color="yellow">Imagine a man in his mid 20s dating Ko Dong Mi.</font>

701
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,710
<font color="yellow">It's ambiguous. She won't be criticised properly, and...</font>

702
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,350
<font color="yellow">she'll feel bad from many people noticing the age difference.</font>

703
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,310
<font color="yellow">Now, imagine a 28-year-old man with Ko Dong Mi.</font>

704
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,010
<font color="yellow">That's a fantasy romance.</font>

705
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,680
<font color="yellow">Even if she holds hands with the man who is still young and charming,</font>

706
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,650
<font color="yellow">people won't take her for being his aunt.</font>

707
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,210
<font color="yellow">Besides, by that age, he must have dated a few girls.</font>

708
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:31,310
<font color="yellow">So he won't do things that will upset you.</font>

709
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,350
<font color="yellow">Hey, you are in luck.</font>

710
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,210
<font color="yellow">You got lucky this time.</font>

711
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,550
<font color="yellow">I will help you.</font>

712
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:48,710
<font color="yellow">By the way, is something wrong? There are reporters outside.</font>

713
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,210
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I heard a top celebrity got admitted.</font>

714
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:52,510
<font color="yellow">That's what the nurses said.</font>

715
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,180
<font color="yellow">A top celebrity?</font>

716
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,810
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

717
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,910
<font color="yellow">- Here's your coffee. - Thanks.</font>

718
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,310
<font color="yellow">What's this? Why did they write this article?</font>

719
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,810
<font color="yellow">- Hurry and look. - What is it?</font>

720
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:20,710
<font color="yellow">("Han Mi Mo and Koo Seul Ah's Ill-Fated Relationship Continues.")</font>

721
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,310
<font color="yellow">- You always do that in my place. - Gosh.</font>

722
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,410
<font color="yellow">(Romeo)</font>

723
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,210
<font color="yellow">Hey. What's up?</font>

724
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,610
<font color="yellow">Han Mi Mo, where are you?</font>

725
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,880
<font color="yellow">- Me? I'm at the hospital. - Which hospital? Where?</font>

726
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,310
<font color="yellow">I'm visiting my friend who recently had a surgery.</font>

727
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,850
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

728
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,150
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

729
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:52,910
<font color="yellow">Hey, those reporters are...</font>

730
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,110
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

731
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,450
<font color="yellow">Koo Seul Ah had a miscarriage?</font>

732
01:00:58,810 --> 01:00:59,810
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

733
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

734
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,010
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - What's wrong? What is it?</font>

735
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:10,610
<font color="yellow">Why is Han Mi Mo and Kim Jung Hoon mentioned now?</font>

736
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,710
<font color="yellow">("The Cause of Koo Seul Ah's Miscarriage Is Han Mi Mo!")</font>

737
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,380
<font color="yellow">Why should I hide when I did nothing wrong?</font>

738
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,910
<font color="yellow">It doesn't have anything to do with me.</font>

739
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,610
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be Koo Seul Ah again?</font>

740
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:32,210
<font color="yellow">Mi Mo, maybe you should leave at night.</font>

741
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:35,950
<font color="yellow">Even if you didn't do anything wrong, they won't think so.</font>

742
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:39,380
<font color="yellow">You want me to avoid them? But I did nothing wrong.</font>

743
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:46,780
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

744
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,010
<font color="yellow">You really are a goldfish, aren't you?</font>

745
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,180
<font color="yellow">Even if you are innocent, you should know to avoid the rain.</font>

746
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,380
<font color="yellow">Koo Seul Ah had a miscarriage, and she's hospitalised here.</font>

747
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,350
<font color="yellow">And there's an article that you are Kim Jung Hoon's girl.</font>

748
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,650
<font color="yellow">How can you walk through the lobby when you should be avoiding them?</font>

749
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,110
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

750
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,880
<font color="yellow">Do you know what will happen when they get a picture of you?</font>

751
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,510
<font color="yellow">You will be the wicked one!</font>

752
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:08,450
<font color="yellow">It's all right. Don't worry about me.</font>

753
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,450
<font color="yellow">Let's go home in my car. Let's avoid it first.</font>

754
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,110
<font color="yellow">I will take care of it myself.</font>

755
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,310
<font color="yellow">This is not the first time something like this has happened.</font>

756
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:24,080
<font color="yellow">And I am not that weak. I don't need your protection.</font>

757
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,910
<font color="yellow">So don't worry.</font>

758
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:29,010
<font color="yellow">It's not something you should worry about.</font>

759
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:42,710
